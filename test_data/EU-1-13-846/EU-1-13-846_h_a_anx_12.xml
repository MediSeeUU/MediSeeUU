 • the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) (see section 5.1). 
 • the treatment of adult men with metastatic crpc who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet 
 clinically indicated (see section 5.1). 
 • the treatment of adult men with metastatic crpc whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment with enzalutamide should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the medical treatment of prostate cancer. 
 posology</p><p>
 the recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg soft capsules) as a single oral daily dose.</p><p>
 medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) analogue should be 
 continued during treatment of patients not surgically castrated.</p><p>
 if a patient misses taking xtandi</p><p>at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as 
 possible to the usual time. if a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the 
 following day with the usual daily dose.</p><p>
 if a patient experiences a ≥ grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be 
 withheld for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced 
 dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p><p>
 3 concomitant use with strong cyp2c8 inhibitors the concomitant use of strong cyp2c8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg 
 once daily. if co-administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose 
 should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 elderly no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a, b or c, respectively). an increased half-life of enzalutamide has however been 
 observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>
 renal impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.4). paediatric population</p><p>there is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of adult men with crpc and mhspc. 
 method of administration</p><p>
 xtandi is for oral use. the soft capsules should not be chewed, dissolved or opened but should be 
 swallowed whole with water, and can be taken with or without food.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p><p>women who are or may become pregnant (see sections 4.6 and 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>risk of seizure use of enzalutamide has been associated with seizure (see section 4.8). the decision to continue 
 treatment in patients who develop seizures should be taken case by case.</p><p>
 posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
 there have been rare reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) in patients 
 receiving xtandi (see section 4.8). pres is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present 
 with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, blindness, and other visual 
 and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. a diagnosis of pres requires 
 confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (mri). discontinuation of 
 xtandi in patients who develop pres is recommended.</p><p>
 second primary malignancies 
 cases of second primary malignancies have been reported in patients treated with enzalutamide in 
 clinical studies. in phase 3 clinical studies, the most frequently reported events in enzalutamide treated 
 patients, and greater than placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.2%), 
 transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of 
 gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary 
 urgency develop during treatment with enzalutamide.</p><p>
 4 concomitant use with other medicinal products 
 enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used 
 medicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). a review of concomitant medicinal products should 
 therefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. concomitant use of enzalutamide with 
 medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see 
 section 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, 
 and if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma 
 concentrations.</p><p>
 co-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. if xtandi is 
 co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by cyp2c9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), 
 additional international normalised ratio (inr) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in 
 this patient population.</p><p>
 severe hepatic impairment 
 an increased half-life of enzalutamide has been observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment, 
 possibly related to increased tissue distribution. the clinical relevance of this observation remains 
 unknown. a prolonged time to reach steady state concentrations is however anticipated, and the time 
 to maximum pharmacological effect as well as time for onset and decline of enzyme induction (see 
 section 4.5) may be increased.</p><p>
 recent cardiovascular disease 
 the phase 3 studies excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or 
 unstable angina (in the past 3 months), new york heart association class (nyha) iii or iv heart 
 failure except if left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ≥ 45%, bradycardia or uncontrolled 
 hypertension. this should be taken into account if xtandi is prescribed in these patients.</p><p>
 androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the qt interval 
 in patients with a history of or risk factors for qt prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant 
 medicinal products that might prolong the qt interval (see section 4.5) physicians should assess the 
 benefit risk ratio including the potential for torsade de pointes prior to initiating xtandi.</p><p>
 use with chemotherapy 
 the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been 
 established. co-administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant effect on the 
 pharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel (see section 4.5); however, an increase in the occurrence of 
 docetaxel-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded.</p><p>excipients 
 xtandi contains sorbitol (e420). patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should 
 not take this medicinal product.</p><p>
 hypersensitivity reactions 
 hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, 
 lip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide (see section 4.8). severe cutaneous 
 5 adverse reactions (scars) have been reported with enzalutamide. at the time of prescription patients 
 should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>potential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures</p><p>cyp2c8 inhibitors</p><p>cyp2c8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. following oral administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice 
 daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide increased by 326% while c
 max of enzalutamide decreased by 18%. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active 
 metabolite, the auc increased by 77% while c
 max decreased by 19%. strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) of cyp2c8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enzalutamide treatment. if 
 patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be 
 reduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2).</p><p>cyp3a4 inhibitors</p><p>cyp3a4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. following oral administration of the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of 
 enzalutamide increased by 41% while c
 max was unchanged. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased by 27% while c
 max was again unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors of cyp3a4.</p><p>
 cyp2c8 and cyp3a4 inducers following oral administration of the moderate cyp2c8 and strong cyp3a4 inducer rifampin (600 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide plus the active metabolite decreased by 
 37% while c
 max remained unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inducers of cyp2c8 or cyp3a4.</p><p>
 potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products</p><p>enzyme induction enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of 
 enzymes or transporters is expected. the reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and 
 lead to lost or reduced clinical effect. there is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. 
 enzymes that may be induced include cyp3a in the liver and gut, cyp2b6, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and 
 uridine 5&apos;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugts - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). the 
 transport protein p-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug 
 resistance-associated protein 2 (mrp2), breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) and the organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1).</p><p> in vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4 and a moderate inducer of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19. co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral 
 doses of sensitive cyp substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the auc 
 of midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the auc of s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), 
 and a 70% decrease in the auc of omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate). ugt1a1 may have been 
 induced as well. in a clinical study in patients with metastatic crpc, xtandi (160 mg once daily) had 
 no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel 
 (75 mg/m
 2 by infusion every 3 weeks). the auc of docetaxel decreased by 12% [geometric mean ratio (gmr) = 0.882 (90% ci: 0.767, 1.02)] while c
 max decreased by 4% [gmr = 0.963 (90% ci: 0.834, 1.11)].</p><p>
 interactions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport 
 are expected. if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are 
 not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal 
 6 products are to be avoided or used with caution. the risk for liver injury after paracetamol 
 administration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers.</p><p>
 groups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to:</p><p>
 • analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) • antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) • anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) • antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) • antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) • antithrombotics (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin, clopidogrel) • betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol) • calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) • cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) • corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) • hiv antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) • hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) • immunosuppressant (e.g. tacrolimus) • proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) • statins metabolised by cyp3a4 (e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin) • thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine)</p><p>
 the full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start 
 of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some 
 induction effects may be apparent earlier. patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of 
 cyp2b6, cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 or ugt1a1 should be evaluated for possible loss of 
 pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during 
 the first month of enzalutamide treatment and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. in 
 consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may 
 persist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. a gradual dose reduction of the 
 concomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>
 cyp1a2 and cyp2c8 substrates enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the auc or cmax of caffeine (cyp1a2 substrate) or pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate). the auc of pioglitazone increased 
 by 20% while c
 max decreased by 18%. the auc and cmax of caffeine decreased by 11% and 4%, respectively. no dose adjustment is indicated when a cyp1a2 or cyp2c8 substrate is 
 co-administered with xtandi.</p><p>p-gp substrates</p><p>in vitro</p><p>data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-gp. the effect of enzalutamide on p-gp substrates has not been evaluated 
 in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer of p-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (pxr). 
 medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for p-gp (e.g. colchicine, 
 dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
 xtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.</p><p>bcrp, mrp2, oat3 and oct1 substrates</p><p>based on in vitro data, inhibition of bcrp and mrp2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. 
 theoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.</p><p>
 medicinal products which prolong the qt interval</p><p>since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the qt interval, the concomitant use of xtandi with medicinal products known to prolong the qt interval or medicinal products able to induce torsade de 
 pointes such as class ia (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class iii (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, 
 7 ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be 
 carefully evaluated (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 effect of food on enzalutamide exposures 
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. in clinical trials, 
 xtandi was administered without regard to food.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential there are no human data on the use of xtandi in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use in 
 women of childbearing potential. this medicine may cause harm to the unborn child or potential loss 
 of pregnancy if taken by women who are pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6).</p><p>
 contraception in males and females 
 it is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. a condom is required 
 during and for 3 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity 
 with a pregnant woman. if the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing 
 potential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after 
 treatment. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
 pregnancy 
 enzalutamide is not for use in women. enzalutamide is contraindicated in women who are or may 
 become pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6).

 seizure in controlled clinical studies, 22 patients (0.5%) experienced a seizure out of 4168 patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas three patients (0.1%) receiving placebo and one patient 
 (0.3%) receiving bicalutamide, experienced a seizure. dose appears to be an important predictor of the 
 risk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical data, and data from a dose-escalation study. in the controlled 
 clinical studies, patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded.</p><p>
 in the 9785-cl-0403 (upward) single-arm trial to assess incidence of seizure in patients with 
 predisposing factors for seizure (whereof 1.6% had a history of seizures), 8 of 366 (2.2%) patients 
 treated with enzalutamide experienced a seizure. the median duration of treatment was 9.3 months.</p><p>
 the mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure threshold is not known but could be 
 9 related to data from 
 in vitro studies showing that enzalutamide and its active metabolite bind to and can inhibit the activity of the gaba-gated chloride channel.</p><p>
 ischemic heart disease in randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred in 3.7% of patients treated with enzalutamide plus adt compared to 1.5% patients treated with placebo plus adt.

 mechanism of action 
 prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor 
 signalling. despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling 
 continues to promote disease progression. stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor 
 requires nuclear localization and dna binding. enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling 
 inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. enzalutamide 
 competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, and consequently; inhibits nuclear 
 translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with 
 dna even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to 
 anti-androgens. enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce 
 cancer cell death and tumour regression. in preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor 
 agonist activity. 
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in a phase 3 clinical trial (affirm) of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of 
 patients treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% 
 decline from baseline in psa levels.</p><p>
 in another phase 3 clinical trial (prevail) in chemo-naïve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide 
 demonstrated a significantly higher total psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from 
 baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% (difference = 74.5%, 
 p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in a phase 2 clinical trial (terrain) in chemo-naïve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide 
 demonstrated a significantly higher total psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from 
 baseline), compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 82.1% versus 20.9% (difference = 61.2%, 
 p &lt; 0.0001)</p><p>
 10 in a single arm trial (9785-cl-0410) of patients previously treated with at least 24 weeks of 
 abiraterone (plus prednisone), 22.4% had a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in psa levels. according to 
 prior chemotherapy history, the results proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in psa levels 
 were 22.1% and 23.2%, for the no prior chemotherapy and prior chemotherapy patient groups, 
 respectively.</p><p>
 in the mdv3100-09 clinical trial (strive) of non-metastatic and metastatic crpc, patients receiving 
 enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total confirmed psa response rate (defined as a 
 ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 81.3% versus 31.3% 
 (difference = 50.0%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in the mdv3100-14 clinical trial (prosper) of non-metastatic crpc, patients receiving 
 enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher confirmed psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% 
 reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 76.3% versus 2.4% 
 (difference = 73.9%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 efficacy of enzalutamide was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre phase 3 
 clinical studies [mdv3100-14 (prosper), crpc2 (affirm), mdv3100-03 (prevail)] of 
 patients with progressive prostate cancer who had disease progression on androgen deprivation therapy 
 [lhrh analogue or after bilateral orchiectomy]. the prevail study enrolled metastatic crpc 
 chemotherapy-naïve patients; whereas the affirm study enrolled metastatic crpc patients who had 
 received prior docetaxel; and the prosper study enrolled patients with non-metastatic crpc. 
 additionally, efficacy in patients with mhspc was also established in one randomised, placebo-
 controlled multicentre phase 3 clinical study [9785-cl-0335 (arches)]. all patients were treated 
 with a lhrh analogue or had bilateral orchiectomy.</p><p>
 in the active treatment arm, xtandi was administered orally at a dose of 160 mg daily. in the four 
 clinical studies (arches, prosper, affirm and prevail), patients received placebo in the 
 control arm and patients were allowed, but not required, to take prednisone (maximum daily dose 
 allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent).</p><p>
 changes in psa serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. therefore, 
 in the four studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until 
 discontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study. 
 9785-cl-0335 (arches) study (patients with metastatic hspc) the arches study enrolled 1150 patients with mhspc randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with enzalutamide plus adt or placebo plus adt (adt defined as lhrh analogue or bilateral 
 orchiectomy). patients received enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily (n=574) or placebo (n=576).</p><p>
 patients with metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or 
 metastatic lesions on ct or mri scan (for soft tissue) were eligible. patients whose disease spread was 
 limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes were not eligible. patients were allowed to receive up to 6 
 cycles of docetaxel therapy with final treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1 
 and no evidence of disease progression during or after the completion of docetaxel therapy. excluded 
 were patients with known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease or with a 
 history of seizure or any contribution that may dispose to seizure.</p><p>
 the demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. 
 the median age at randomisation was 70 years in both treatment groups. most patients in the total 
 population were caucasian (80.5%); 13.5% were asian and 1.4% were black. the eastern 
 cooperative oncology group performance status (ecog ps) score was 0 for 78% of patients and 1

 (psadt) (&lt; 6 months or ≥ 6 months) and the use of bone-targeting agents (yes or no).</p><p>
 the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. 
 the median age at randomisation was 74 years in the enzalutamide arm and 73 years in the placebo 
 arm. most patients (approximately 71%) in the study were caucasian; 16% were asian and 2% were 
 black. eighty-one percent (81%) of patients had an ecog performance status score of 0 and 19%

 to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 198) or bicalutamide at a dose of 
 50 mg once daily (n = 198). pfs was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to

 mdv3100-03 (prevail) study (chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc)</p><p>a total of 1717 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 872) or placebo orally 
 once daily (n = 845). patients with visceral disease, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart 
 failure (nyha class i or ii), and patients taking medicinal products associated with lowering the 
 seizure threshold were allowed. patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might 
 predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. 
 study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-
 related event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of either a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an 
 investigational agent, or until unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>
 16 patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. 
 the median age was 71 years (range 42 - 93) and the racial distribution was 77% caucasian, 
 10% asian, 2% black and 11% other or unknown races. sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients had an 
 ecog performance status score of 0 and 32% patients had an ecog performance status of 1. 
 baseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients and 2 - 3 (mildly symptomatic) 
 in 32% of patients as defined by the brief pain inventory short form (worst pain over past 24 hours 
 on a scale of 0 to 10). approximately 45% of patients had measurable soft tissue disease at study 
 entry, and 12% of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases.</p><p>
 co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival 
 (rpfs). in addition to the co-primary endpoints, benefit was also assessed using time to initiation of 
 cytotoxic chemotherapy, best overall soft tissue response, time to first skeletal-related event, psa 
 response (≥ 50% decrease from baseline), time to psa progression, and time to fact-p total score 
 degradation.</p><p>
 radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies as defined by 
 prostate cancer clinical trials working group 2 (pcwg2) criteria (for bone lesions) and/or response 
 evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist v 1.1) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). analysis of rpfs 
 utilised centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.</p><p>
 at the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival when 540 deaths were observed, treatment 
 with enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to 
 treatment with placebo with a 29.4% reduction in risk of death [hr = 0.706 (95% ci: 0.60; 0.84),

 22</p><p>
 radiographic progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator using recist v 1.1 for soft 
 tissue and appearance of 2 or more bone lesions in bone scan was 8.3 months for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 2.9 months for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.40 (95% ci: 0.35, 0.47), 
 p &lt; 0.0001]. the analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented 
 progression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to 
 bone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions.</p><p>
 confirmed psa decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p &lt; 0.0001). the 
 median time to psa progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 3.0 months 
 for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.25 (95% ci: 0.20, 0.30), p &lt; 0.0001].</p><p>
 the median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide 
 and 13.3 months for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.69 (95% ci: 0.57, 0.84), p &lt; 0.0001]. a 
 skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, 
 spinal cord compression or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis involved 
 448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were spinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change 
 in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone.</p><p>
 9785-cl-0410 study (enzalutamide post abiraterone in patients with metastatic crpc)</p><p>the study was a single-arm study in 214 patients with progressing metastatic crpc who received enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) after at least 24 weeks of treatment with abiraterone acetate plus 
 prednisone. median rpfs (radiologic progression free survival, the study´s primary endpoint) was 
 8.1 months (95% ci: 6.1, 8.3). median os was not reached. psa response (defined as ≥ 50% 
 decrease from baseline) was 22.4% (95% ci: 17.0, 28.6). for the 69 patients who previously received 
 chemotherapy, median rpfs was 7.9 months (95% ci: 5.5, 10.8). psa response was 23.2% (95% ci: 
 13.9, 34.9). for the 145 patients who had no previous chemotherapy, median rpfs was 8.1 months 
 (95% ci: 5.7, 8.3). psa response was 22.1% (95% ci: 15.6, 29.7).</p><p>
 although there was a limited response in some patients from treatment with enzalutamide after 
 abiraterone, the reason for this finding is currently unknown. the study design could neither identify 
 the patients who are likely to benefit, nor the order in which enzalutamide and abiraterone should be 
 optimally sequenced.</p><p>
 elderly 
 of the 4168 patients in the controlled clinical trials who received enzalutamide, 3265 patients (78%) 
 were 65 years and over and 1469 patients (35%) were 75 years and over. no overall differences in 
 safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. 
 paediatric population</p><p>
 the european medicines agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
 enzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
 information on paediatric use).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>enzalutamide is poorly water soluble. the solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. in preclinical studies, the absorption of enzalutamide was 
 increased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy 
 male subjects. the mean terminal half-life (t
 1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. with daily 
 oral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. daily 
 23 fluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). clearance of 
 enzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as 
 active as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as enzalutamide.</p><p>
 absorption</p><p>
 maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) of enzalutamide in patients are observed 1 to 2 hours after administration. based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated 
 to be at least 84.2%. enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters p-gp or bcrp. at 
 steady state, the mean c
 max values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 μg/ml (23% coefficient of variation [cv]) and 12.7 μg/ml (30% cv), respectively.</p><p>
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. in clinical trials, xtandi was 
 administered without regard to food. 
 distribution</p><p>
 the mean apparent volume of distribution (v/f) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 
 110 l (29% cv). the volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body 
 water, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide 
 and its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. the active metabolite is 
 95% bound to plasma proteins. there was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and 
 other highly bound medicinal products (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) 
 in vitro. biotransformation</p><p>
 enzalutamide is extensively metabolised. there are two major metabolites in human plasma: 
 n-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). enzalutamide is 
 metabolised by cyp2c8 and to a lesser extent by cyp3a4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a 
 role in the formation of the active metabolite. 
 in vitro, n-desmethyl enzalutamide is metabolised to the carboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the metabolism of 
 enzalutamide to the carboxylic acid metabolite.</p><p>n-desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolised by 
 cyps 
 in vitro.</p><p> 
 under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4, a moderate inducer of 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19, and has no clinically relevant effect on cyp2c8 (see section 4.5). 
 elimination</p><p>
 the mean apparent clearance (cl/f) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 l/h.</p><p>
 following oral administration of 
 14c-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of 
 enzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as 
 unchanged enzalutamide).</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for oatp1b1, oatp1b3, or oct1; and n-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate for p-gp or bcrp.</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oct2, or oat1. 
 linearity</p><p>
 no major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. the 
 steady-state c
 min values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained constant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics 
 once steady-state is achieved. 
 24</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 no formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. patients with serum 
 creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) were excluded from clinical studies. based on a population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine 
 clearance (crcl) values ≥ 30 ml/min (estimated by the cockcroft and gault formula). enzalutamide 
 has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (crcl &lt; 30 ml/min) or end-stage 
 renal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. it is unlikely that enzalutamide will 
 be significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 hepatic impairment did not have a pronounced effect on the total exposure to enzalutamide or its 
 active metabolite. the half-life of enzalutamide was however doubled in patients with severe hepatic 
 impairment compared with healthy controls (10.4 days compared to 4.7 days), possibly related to an 
 increased tissue distribution.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (n = 6), 
 moderate (n = 8) or severe (n = 8) hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a, b or c, respectively) and 
 in 22 matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. following a single oral 160 mg dose of 
 enzalutamide, the auc and c
 max for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% and 24%, respectively, the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with severe impairment increased by 5% and decreased by 41%, respectively, compared to 
 healthy control subjects. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the 
 auc and c
 max in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, the auc and c
 max in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max in subjects with severe hepatic impairment increased by 34% and decreased by 27%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects.</p><p>
 race 
 most patients in the controlled clinical studies (&gt; 77%) were caucasian. based on pharmacokinetic 
 data from studies in japanese and chinese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically 
 relevant differences in exposure among the populations. there are insufficient data to evaluate 
 potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races.</p><p>
 elderly 
 no clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the elderly 
 population pharmacokinetic analysis.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>enzalutamide treatment of pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths and external and skeletal changes. fertility studies were not conducted with enzalutamide, but in studies in 
 rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 39 weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, and 
 hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the reproductive system were noted, consistent with the pharmacological 
 activity of enzalutamide. in studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 
 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases in organ 
 weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymis. leydig cell hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia were 
 observed in mice (4 weeks) and dogs (39 weeks). additional changes to reproductive tissues included 
 hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats and testicular 
 hypospermia and seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. gender differences were noted in rat 
 mammary glands (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). changes in the reproductive organs 
 in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide and reversed or 
 partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. there were no other important changes in clinical 
 pathology or histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either species.</p><p>
 25 studies in pregnant rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to fetuses. 
 after oral administration of radiolabeled 
 14c-enzalutamide to rats on day 14 of pregnancy at a dose of 30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the 
 fetus was reached 4 hours after administration and was lower than that in the maternal plasma with 
 tissue/plasma ratio of 0.27. the radioactivity in the fetus decreased to 0.08 times the maximum 
 concentration at 72 hours after administration.</p><p>
 studies in lactating rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk. 
 after oral administration of radiolabeled 
 14c-enzalutamide to lactating rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the milk was 
 reached 4 hours after administration and was up to 3.54-fold higher than that in the maternal plasma. 
 study results also have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to infant rat 
 tissues via milk and subsequently eliminated.</p><p>
 enzalutamide was negative for genotoxicity in a standard battery of 
 in vitro and in vivo tests. in a 6-month study in transgenic rash2 mice, enzalutamide did not show carcinogenic potential (absence of 
 neoplastic findings) at doses up to 20 mg/kg per day (auc
 24h ~317 µg·h/ml), which resulted in plasma exposure levels similar to the clinical exposure (auc
 24h ~322 µg·h/ml) in mcrpc patients receiving 160 mg, daily.</p><p>
 daily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide produced an increased incidence of neoplastic 
 findings. these included benign thymoma, fibroadenoma in the mammary glands, benign leydig cell 
 tumours in the testes and urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder in males; benign 
 granulosa cell tumour in the ovaries in females and adenoma in the pars distalis of the pituitary in both 
 sexes. the human relevance of thymoma, pituitary adenoma and mammary fibroadenoma as well as 
 urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder cannot be ruled out.</p><p>

 posology</p><p>
 the recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg film-coated tablets or two 
 80 mg film-coated tablets) as a single oral daily dose.</p><p>
 medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) analogue should be 
 continued during treatment of patients not surgically castrated.</p><p>
 if a patient misses taking xtandi</p><p>at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as 
 possible to the usual time. if a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the 
 following day with the usual daily dose.</p><p>
 28 if a patient experiences a ≥ grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be 
 withheld for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced 
 dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p><p>
 concomitant use with strong cyp2c8 inhibitors the concomitant use of strong cyp2c8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg 
 once daily. if co-administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose 
 should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 elderly no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a, b or c, respectively). an increased half-life of enzalutamide has however been 
 observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>
 renal impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.4). paediatric population</p><p>there is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of adult men with crpc and mhspc. 
 method of administration</p><p>
 xtandi is for oral use. the film-coated tablets should not be cut, crushed or chewed but should be 
 swallowed whole with water, and can be taken with or without food.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p><p>women who are or may become pregnant (see sections 4.6 and 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>risk of seizure use of enzalutamide has been associated with seizure (see section 4.8). the decision to continue 
 treatment in patients who develop seizures should be taken case by case.</p><p>
 posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
 there have been rare reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) in patients 
 receiving xtandi (see section 4.8). pres is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present 
 with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, blindness, and other visual 
 and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. a diagnosis of pres requires 
 confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (mri). discontinuation of 
 xtandi in patients who develop pres is recommended.</p><p>
 second primary malignancies 
 cases of second primary malignancies have been reported in patients treated with enzalutamide in 
 clinical studies. in phase 3 clinical studies, the most frequently reported events in enzalutamide treated 
 patients, and greater than placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.2%), 
 transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of 
 gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary 
 urgency develop during treatment with enzalutamide. 
 29</p><p>
 concomitant use with other medicinal products 
 enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used 
 medicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). a review of concomitant medicinal products should 
 therefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. concomitant use of enzalutamide with 
 medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see 
 section 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, 
 and if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma 
 concentrations.</p><p>
 co-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. if xtandi is 
 co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by cyp2c9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), 
 additional international normalised ratio (inr) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in 
 this patient population.</p><p>
 severe hepatic impairment 
 an increased half-life of enzalutamide has been observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment, 
 possibly related to increased tissue distribution. the clinical relevance of this observation remains 
 unknown. a prolonged time to reach steady state concentrations is however anticipated, and the time 
 to maximum pharmacological effect as well as time for onset and decline of enzyme induction (see 
 section 4.5) may be increased.</p><p>
 recent cardiovascular disease 
 the phase 3 studies excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or 
 unstable angina (in the past 3 months), new york heart association class (nyha) iii or iv heart 
 failure except if left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ≥ 45%, bradycardia or uncontrolled 
 hypertension. this should be taken into account if xtandi is prescribed in these patients.</p><p>
 androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the qt interval 
 in patients with a history of or risk factors for qt prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant 
 medicinal products that might prolong the qt interval (see section 4.5) physicians should assess the 
 benefit risk ratio including the potential for torsade de pointes prior to initiating xtandi.</p><p>
 use with chemotherapy 
 the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been 
 established. co-administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant effect on the 
 pharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel (see section 4.5); however, an increase in the occurrence of 
 docetaxel-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 hypersensitivity reactions 
 hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, 
 lip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide (see section 4.8). severe cutaneous 
 adverse reactions (scars) have been reported with enzalutamide. at the time of prescription patients 
 should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>potential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures</p><p>cyp2c8 inhibitors</p><p>cyp2c8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. following oral administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice 
 daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide increased by 326% while c
 max of 30 enzalutamide decreased by 18%. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active 
 metabolite, the auc increased by 77% while c
 max decreased by 19%. strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) of cyp2c8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enzalutamide treatment. if 
 patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be 
 reduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2).</p><p>cyp3a4 inhibitors</p><p>cyp3a4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. following oral administration of the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of 
 enzalutamide increased by 41% while c
 max was unchanged. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased by 27% while c
 max was again unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors of cyp3a4.</p><p>
 cyp2c8 and cyp3a4 inducers following oral administration of the moderate cyp2c8 and strong cyp3a4 inducer rifampin (600 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide plus the active metabolite decreased by 
 37% while c
 max remained unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inducers of cyp2c8 or cyp3a4.</p><p>
 potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products</p><p>enzyme induction enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of 
 enzymes or transporters is expected. the reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and 
 lead to lost or reduced clinical effect. there is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. 
 enzymes that may be induced include cyp3a in the liver and gut, cyp2b6, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and 
 uridine 5&apos;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugts - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). the 
 transport protein p-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug 
 resistance-associated protein 2 (mrp2), breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) and the organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1).</p><p> in vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4 and a moderate inducer of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19. co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral 
 doses of sensitive cyp substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the auc 
 of midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the auc of s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), 
 and a 70% decrease in the auc of omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate). ugt1a1 may have been 
 induced as well. in a clinical study in patients with metastatic crpc, xtandi (160 mg once daily) had 
 no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel 
 (75 mg/m

 interactions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport 
 are expected. if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are 
 not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal 
 products are to be avoided or used with caution. the risk for liver injury after paracetamol 
 administration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers.</p><p>
 groups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to:</p><p>
 • analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) • antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) • anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) • antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) • antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) • antithrombotics (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin, clopidogrel) 31 • betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol) • calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) • cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) • corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) • hiv antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) • hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) • immunosuppressant (e.g. tacrolimus) • proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) • statins metabolised by cyp3a4 (e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin) • thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine)</p><p>
 the full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start 
 of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some 
 induction effects may be apparent earlier. patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of 
 cyp2b6, cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 or ugt1a1 should be evaluated for possible loss of 
 pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during 
 the first month of enzalutamide treatment and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. in 
 consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may 
 persist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. a gradual dose reduction of the 
 concomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>
 cyp1a2 and cyp2c8 substrates enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the auc or cmax of caffeine (cyp1a2 substrate) or pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate). the auc of pioglitazone increased 
 by 20% while c
 max decreased by 18%. the auc and cmax of caffeine decreased by 11% and 4%, respectively. no dose adjustment is indicated when a cyp1a2 or cyp2c8 substrate is 
 co-administered with xtandi.</p><p>p-gp substrates</p><p>in vitro</p><p>data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-gp. the effect of enzalutamide on p-gp substrates has not been evaluated 
 in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer of p-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (pxr). 
 medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for p-gp (e.g. colchicine, 
 dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
 xtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.</p><p>bcrp, mrp2, oat3 and oct1 substrates</p><p>based on in vitro data, inhibition of bcrp and mrp2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. 
 theoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.</p><p>
 medicinal products which prolong the qt interval</p><p>since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the qt interval, the concomitant use of xtandi with medicinal products known to prolong the qt interval or medicinal products able to induce torsade de 
 pointes such as class ia (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class iii (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, 
 ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be 
 carefully evaluated (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 effect of food on enzalutamide exposures 
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. in clinical trials, 
 xtandi was administered without regard to food.

 seizure in controlled clinical studies, 22 patients (0.5%) experienced a seizure out of 4168 patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas three patients (0.1%) receiving placebo and one patient 
 (0.3%) receiving bicalutamide, experienced a seizure. dose appears to be an important predictor of the 
 risk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical data, and data from a dose-escalation study. in the controlled 
 clinical studies, patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded.</p><p>
 in the 9785-cl-0403 (upward) single-arm trial to assess incidence of seizure in patients with 
 predisposing factors for seizure (whereof 1.6% had a history of seizures), 8 of 366 (2.2%) patients 
 treated with enzalutamide experienced a seizure. the median duration of treatment was 9.3 months.</p><p>
 the mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure threshold is not known but could be 
 related to data from 
 in vitro studies showing that enzalutamide and its active metabolite bind to and can inhibit the activity of the gaba-gated chloride channel.</p><p> 34 ischemic heart disease in randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred in 3.7% of patients treated with enzalutamide plus adt compared to 1.5% patients treated with placebo plus adt.

 mechanism of action 
 prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor 
 signalling. despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling 
 continues to promote disease progression. stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor 
 requires nuclear localization and dna binding. enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling 
 inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. enzalutamide 
 competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, and consequently; inhibits nuclear 
 translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with 
 dna even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to 
 anti-androgens. enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce 
 cancer cell death and tumour regression. in preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor 
 agonist activity. 
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in a phase 3 clinical trial (affirm) of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of 
 patients treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% 
 decline from baseline in psa levels.</p><p>
 in another phase 3 clinical trial (prevail) in chemo-naïve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide 
 demonstrated a significantly higher total psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from 
 baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% (difference = 74.5%, 
 p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in a phase 2 clinical trial (terrain) in chemo-naïve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide 
 demonstrated a significantly higher total psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from 
 baseline), compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 82.1% versus 20.9% (difference = 61.2%, 
 p &lt; 0.0001)</p><p>
 in a single arm trial (9785-cl-0410) of patients previously treated with at least 24 weeks of 
 abiraterone (plus prednisone), 22.4% had a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in psa levels. according to 
 prior chemotherapy history, the results proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in psa levels 
 35 were 22.1% and 23.2%, for the no prior chemotherapy and prior chemotherapy patient groups, 
 respectively.</p><p>
 in the mdv3100-09 clinical trial (strive) of non-metastatic and metastatic crpc, patients receiving 
 enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total confirmed psa response rate (defined as a 
 ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 81.3% versus 31.3% 
 (difference = 50.0%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in the mdv3100-14 clinical trial (prosper) of non-metastatic crpc, patients receiving 
 enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher confirmed psa response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% 
 reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 76.3% versus 2.4% 
 (difference = 73.9%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 efficacy of enzalutamide was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre phase 3 
 clinical studies [mdv3100-14 (prosper), crpc2 (affirm), mdv3100-03 (prevail)] of 
 patients with progressive prostate cancer who had disease progression on androgen deprivation therapy 
 [lhrh analogue or after bilateral orchiectomy]. the prevail study enrolled metastatic crpc 
 chemotherapy-naïve patients; whereas the affirm study enrolled metastatic crpc patients who had 
 received prior docetaxel; and the prosper study enrolled patients with non-metastatic crpc. 
 additionally, efficacy in patients with mhspc was also established in one randomised, placebo-
 controlled multicentre phase 3 clinical study [9785-cl-0335 (arches)]. all patients were treated 
 with a lhrh analogue or had bilateral orchiectomy.</p><p>
 in the active treatment arm, xtandi was administered orally at a dose of 160 mg daily. in the four 
 clinical studies (arches, prosper, affirm and prevail), patients received placebo in the 
 control arm and patients were allowed, but not required, to take prednisone (maximum daily dose 
 allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent).</p><p>
 changes in psa serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. therefore, 
 in the four studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until 
 discontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study.</p><p>
 9785-cl-0335 (arches) study (patients with metastatic hspc) the arches study enrolled 1150 patients with mhspc randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with enzalutamide plus adt or placebo plus adt (adt defined as lhrh analogue or bilateral 
 orchiectomy). patients received enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily (n=574) or placebo (n=576).</p><p>
 patients with metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or 
 metastatic lesions on ct or mri scan (for soft tissue) were eligible. patients whose disease spread was 
 limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes were not eligible. patients were allowed to receive up to 6 
 cycles of docetaxel therapy with final treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1 
 and no evidence of disease progression during or after the completion of docetaxel therapy. excluded 
 were patients with known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease or with a 
 history of seizure or any contribution that may dispose to seizure.</p><p>
 the demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. 
 the median age at randomisation was 70 years in both treatment groups. most patients in the total 
 population were caucasian (80.5%); 13.5% were asian and 1.4% were black. the eastern 
 cooperative oncology group performance status (ecog ps) score was 0 for 78% of patients and 1 
 for 22% of patients at study entry. patients were stratified by low versus high volume of disease and 
 prior docetaxel therapy for prostate cancer.</p><p>thirty-seven percent of patients had a low volume of 
 disease and 63% of patients had a high volume of disease.</p><p>eighty-two percent of patients had not 
 36 received prior docetaxel therapy, 2% received 1-5 cycles and 16% received 6 prior cycles. treatment 
 with concurrent docetaxel was not allowed.</p><p>
 radiographic progression-free survival (rpfs), based on independent central review, was the primary 
 endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease 
 progression or death (due to any cause from time of randomisation up until 24 weeks from study drug

 (psadt) (&lt; 6 months or ≥ 6 months) and the use of bone-targeting agents (yes or no).</p><p>
 the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. 
 the median age at randomisation was 74 years in the enzalutamide arm and 73 years in the placebo 
 arm. most patients (approximately 71%) in the study were caucasian; 16% were asian and 2% were 
 black. eighty-one percent (81%) of patients had an ecog performance status score of 0 and 19% 
 patients had an ecog performance status of 1.</p><p>
 metastasis-free survival (mfs) was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to 
 radiographic progression or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of 
 radiographic progression, whichever occurred first. key secondary endpoints assessed in the study 
 were time to psa progression, time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy (tta), overall survival 
 (os). additional secondary endpoints included time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and 
 chemotherapy-free survival. see results below (table 3).</p><p>
 enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 71% reduction in the relative risk of radiographic

 to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 198) or bicalutamide at a dose of 
 50 mg once daily (n = 198). pfs was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to 
 the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression, psa progression, or death on study. 
 median pfs was 19.4 months (95% ci: 16.5, not reached) in the enzalutamide group versus

 with enzalutamide and 49 out of 69 (71.0%) patients treated with bicalutamide had pfs events 
 (68 total events). the hazard ratio was 0.24 (95% ci: 0.14, 0.42) and the median time to a pfs event

 or bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg once daily (n = 191). median pfs was 15.7 months for patients on 
 enzalutamide versus 5.8 months for patients on bicalutamide [hr = 0.44 (95% ci: 0.34, 0.57), p &lt;

 progression by independent central review, skeletal-related events, initiation of new antineoplastic 
 therapy or death by any cause, whichever occurred first.</p><p>consistent pfs benefit was observed across 
 all pre-specified patient subgroups.</p><p>
 mdv3100-03 (prevail) study (chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc)</p><p>a total of 1717 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 872) or placebo orally 
 once daily (n = 845). patients with visceral disease, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart 
 failure (nyha class i or ii), and patients taking medicinal products associated with lowering the 
 seizure threshold were allowed. patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might 
 predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. 
 study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-
 related event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of either a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an 
 investigational agent, or until unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>
 patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. 
 the median age was 71 years (range 42 - 93) and the racial distribution was 77% caucasian, 
 10% asian, 2% black and 11% other or unknown races. sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients had an 
 ecog performance status score of 0 and 32% patients had an ecog performance status of 1. 
 baseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients and 2 - 3 (mildly symptomatic) 
 in 32% of patients as defined by the brief pain inventory short form (worst pain over past 24 hours 
 on a scale of 0 to 10). approximately 45% of patients had measurable soft tissue disease at study 
 entry, and 12% of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases.</p><p>
 co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival 
 (rpfs). in addition to the co-primary endpoints, benefit was also assessed using time to initiation of 
 cytotoxic chemotherapy, best overall soft tissue response, time to first skeletal-related event, psa 
 response (≥ 50% decrease from baseline), time to psa progression, and time to fact-p total score 
 degradation.</p><p>
 radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies as defined by 
 prostate cancer clinical trials working group 2 (pcwg2) criteria (for bone lesions) and/or response 
 evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist v 1.1) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). analysis of rpfs 
 utilised centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.</p><p>
 at the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival when 540 deaths were observed, treatment 
 with enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to 
 treatment with placebo with a 29.4% reduction in risk of death [hr = 0.706 (95% ci: 0.60; 0.84), 
 p &lt; 0.0001]. an updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. results 
 from this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (table 4, figure 6). at the 
 updated analysis 52% of enzalutamide-treated and 81% of placebo-treated patients had received 
 subsequent therapies for metastatic crpc that may prolong overall survival.</p><p>
 a final analysis of 5-year prevail data showed a statistically significant increase in overall survival 
 was maintained in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo [hr = 0.835, (95% ci: 
 0.75, 0.93); p-value = 0.0008] despite 28% of patients on placebo crossing over to enzalutamide. the 
 5-year os rate was 26% for the enzalutamide arm compared to 21% for the placebo arm.

 the proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients with measurable disease at baseline who had an 
 objective soft tissue response was 58.8% (95% ci: 53.8, 63.7) compared with 5.0% (95% ci: 3.0, 7.7) 
 of patients receiving placebo. the absolute difference in objective soft tissue response between 
 enzalutamide and placebo arms was [53.9% (95% ci: 48.5, 59.1), p &lt; 0.0001]. complete responses 
 were reported in 19.7% of enzalutamide-treated patients compared with 1.0% of placebo-treated 
 patients, and partial responses were reported in 39.1% of enzalutamide-treated patients versus 3.9% of

 enzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of the first skeletal-related event by 28% [hr = 0.718 
 (95% ci: 0.61, 0.84), p &lt; 0.0001]. a skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery 
 to bone for prostate cancer, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of 
 antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis included 587 skeletal-related events, of which 
 389 events (66.3%) were radiation to bone, 79 events (13.5%) were spinal cord compression, 70 events

 placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 clinical trial. a total of 1199 patients were randomised 2:1 to 
 receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 800) or placebo once daily 
 (n = 399). patients were allowed but not required to take prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed

 until disease progression (defined as confirmed radiographic progression or the occurrence of a 
 skeletal-related event) and initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity,

 the following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the

 radiographic progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator using recist v 1.1 for soft 
 tissue and appearance of 2 or more bone lesions in bone scan was 8.3 months for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 2.9 months for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.40 (95% ci: 0.35, 0.47), 
 p &lt; 0.0001]. the analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented 
 progression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to 
 bone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions.</p><p>
 confirmed psa decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p &lt; 0.0001). the 
 median time to psa progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 3.0 months 
 for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.25 (95% ci: 0.20, 0.30), p &lt; 0.0001].</p><p>
 the median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide 
 and 13.3 months for patients who received placebo [hr = 0.69 (95% ci: 0.57, 0.84), p &lt; 0.0001]. a 
 skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, 
 spinal cord compression or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis involved 
 448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were spinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change 
 in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone.</p><p>
 9785-cl-0410 study (enzalutamide post abiraterone in patients with metastatic crpc)</p><p>the study was a single-arm study in 214 patients with progressing metastatic crpc who received enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) after at least 24 weeks of treatment with abiraterone acetate plus 
 prednisone. median rpfs (radiologic progression free survival, the study´s primary endpoint) was 
 8.1 months (95% ci: 6.1, 8.3). median os was not reached. psa response (defined as ≥ 50% 
 decrease from baseline) was 22.4% (95% ci: 17.0, 28.6). for the 69 patients who previously received 
 chemotherapy, median rpfs was 7.9 months (95% ci: 5.5, 10.8). psa response was 23.2% (95% ci: 
 13.9, 34.9). for the 145 patients who had no previous chemotherapy, median rpfs was 8.1 months 
 (95% ci: 5.7, 8.3). psa response was 22.1% (95% ci: 15.6, 29.7).</p><p>
 although there was a limited response in some patients from treatment with enzalutamide after 
 abiraterone, the reason for this finding is currently unknown. the study design could neither identify 
 the patients who are likely to benefit, nor the order in which enzalutamide and abiraterone should be 
 optimally sequenced.</p><p>
 elderly 
 of the 4168 patients in the controlled clinical trials who received enzalutamide, 3265 patients (78%) 
 were 65 years and over and 1469 patients (35%) were 75 years and over. no overall differences in 
 safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. 
 paediatric population</p><p>
 the european medicines agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
 enzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
 information on paediatric use).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>enzalutamide is poorly water soluble. the solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. in preclinical studies, the absorption of enzalutamide was 
 increased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy 
 male subjects. the mean terminal half-life (t
 1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. with daily 
 oral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. daily 
 48 fluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). clearance of 
 enzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as 
 active as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as enzalutamide.</p><p>
 absorption</p><p>
 oral absorption of film-coated enzalutamide tablets was evaluated in healthy male volunteers after a 
 single 160 mg dose of xtandi film-coated tablets, and pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation were 
 used to predict the pharmacokinetic profile at steady state. based on these predictions, as well as other 
 supportive data, the median time to reach maximum plasma enzalutamide concentrations (c
 max) is 2 hours (range 0.5 to 6 hours), and the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of enzalutamide and its 
 active metabolite are similar for the film-coated tablets and the xtandi soft capsules formulation. 
 following oral administration of the soft capsule formulation (xtandi 160 mg daily) in patients with 
 metastatic crpc, the steady-state plasma mean c
 max values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 μg/ml (23% cv) and 12.7 μg/ml (30% cv), respectively.</p><p>
 based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated to be at least 
 84.2%. enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters p-gp or bcrp.</p><p>
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. in clinical trials, xtandi was 
 administered without regard to food. 
 distribution</p><p>
 the mean apparent volume of distribution (v/f) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 
 110 l (29% cv). the volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body 
 water, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide 
 and its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. the active metabolite is 
 95% bound to plasma proteins. there was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and 
 other highly bound medicinal products (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) 
 in vitro. biotransformation</p><p>
 enzalutamide is extensively metabolised. there are two major metabolites in human plasma: 
 n-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). enzalutamide is 
 metabolised by cyp2c8 and to a lesser extent by cyp3a4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a 
 role in the formation of the active metabolite. 
 in vitro, n-desmethyl enzalutamide is metabolised to the carboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the metabolism of 
 enzalutamide to the carboxylic acid metabolite.</p><p>n-desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolised by 
 cyps 
 in vitro.</p><p> 
 under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4, a moderate inducer of 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19, and has no clinically relevant effect on cyp2c8 (see section 4.5). 
 elimination</p><p>
 the mean apparent clearance (cl/f) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 l/h.</p><p>
 following oral administration of 
 14c-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of 
 enzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as 
 unchanged enzalutamide).</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for oatp1b1, oatp1b3, or oct1; and n-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate for p-gp or bcrp.</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oct2, or oat1. 
 49 linearity</p><p>
 no major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. the 
 steady-state c
 min values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained constant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics 
 once steady-state is achieved.</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 no formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. patients with serum 
 creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) were excluded from clinical studies. based on a population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine 
 clearance (crcl) values ≥ 30 ml/min (estimated by the cockcroft and gault formula). enzalutamide 
 has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (crcl &lt; 30 ml/min) or end-stage 
 renal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. it is unlikely that enzalutamide will 
 be significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 hepatic impairment did not have a pronounced effect on the total exposure to enzalutamide or its 
 active metabolite. the half-life of enzalutamide was however doubled in patients with severe hepatic 
 impairment compared with healthy controls (10.4 days compared to 4.7 days), possibly related to an 
 increased tissue distribution.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (n = 6), 
 moderate (n = 8) or severe (n = 8) hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a, b or c, respectively) and 
 in 22 matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. following a single oral 160 mg dose of 
 enzalutamide, the auc and c
 max for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% and 24%, respectively, the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with severe impairment increased by 5% and decreased by 41%, respectively, compared to 
 healthy control subjects. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the 
 auc and c
 max in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, the auc and c
 max in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max in subjects with severe hepatic impairment increased by 34% and decreased by 27%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects.</p><p>
 race 
 most patients in the controlled clinical studies (&gt; 77%) were caucasian. based on pharmacokinetic 
 data from studies in japanese and chinese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically 
 relevant differences in exposure among the populations. there are insufficient data to evaluate 
 potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races.</p><p>
 elderly 
 no clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the elderly 
 population pharmacokinetic analysis.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>enzalutamide treatment of pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths and external and skeletal changes. fertility studies were not conducted with enzalutamide, but in studies in

 activity of enzalutamide. in studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 
 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases in organ 
 weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymis. leydig cell hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia were 
 observed in mice (4 weeks) and dogs (39 weeks). additional changes to reproductive tissues included 
 hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats and testicular 
 hypospermia and seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. gender differences were noted in rat 
 mammary glands (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). changes in the reproductive organs 
 50 in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide and reversed or 
 partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. there were no other important changes in clinical 
 pathology or histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either species.</p><p>
 studies in pregnant rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to fetuses. 
 after oral administration of radiolabeled 
 14c-enzalutamide to rats on day 14 of pregnancy at a dose of 30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the 
 fetus was reached 4 hours after administration and was lower than that in the maternal plasma with 
 tissue/plasma ratio of 0.27. the radioactivity in the fetus decreased to 0.08 times the maximum 
 concentration at 72 hours after administration.</p><p>
 studies in lactating rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk. 
 after oral administration of radiolabeled 
 14c-enzalutamide to lactating rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the milk was 
 reached 4 hours after administration and was up to 3.54-fold higher than that in the maternal plasma. 
 study results also have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to infant rat 
 tissues via milk and subsequently eliminated.</p><p>
 enzalutamide was negative for genotoxicity in a standard battery of 
 in vitro and in vivo tests. in a 6-month study in transgenic rash2 mice, enzalutamide did not show carcinogenic potential (absence of 
 neoplastic findings) at doses up to 20 mg/kg per day (auc
 24h ~317 µg·h/ml), which resulted in plasma exposure levels similar to the clinical exposure (auc
 24h ~322 µg·h/ml) in mcrpc patients receiving 160 mg, daily.</p><p>
 daily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide produced an increased incidence of neoplastic 
 findings. these included benign thymoma, fibroadenoma in the mammary glands, benign leydig cell 
 tumours in the testes and urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder in males; benign 
 granulosa cell tumour in the ovaries in females and adenoma in the pars distalis of the pituitary in both 
 sexes. the human relevance of thymoma, pituitary adenoma and mammary fibroadenoma as well as 
 urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder cannot be ruled out.</p><p>
 enzalutamide was not phototoxic 
 in vitro.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>tablet core hypromellose acetate succinate
