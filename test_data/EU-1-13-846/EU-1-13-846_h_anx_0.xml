 if a patient misses taking xtandi</p><p>at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as 
 possible to the usual time. if a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the 
 following day with the usual daily dose.</p><p>
 if a patient experiences a ≥ grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be

 dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p><p>
 concomitant use with strong cyp2c8 inhibitors the concomitant use of strong cyp2c8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg 
 once daily. if co-administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose 
 should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor (see section 4.5).</p><p>

 predisposing factors including, but not limited to, underlying brain injury, stroke, primary brain 
 tumours or brain metastases, or alcoholism. in addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients 
 receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold.</p><p>
 concomitant use with other medicinal products 
 enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used 
 medicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). a review of concomitant medicinal products should 
 therefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. concomitant use of enzalutamide with 
 medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see 
 section 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, 
 and if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma 
 concentrations.</p><p>
 co-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. if xtandi is 
 co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by cyp2c9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), 
 additional international normalised ratio (inr) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in 
 this patient population.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 caution is required in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class b) as data in 
 moderate hepatic impairment are not fully conclusive (see section 5.2). as there are no data in patients 
 with severe hepatic impairment and enzalutamide is primarily hepatically eliminated, xtandi is not 
 recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c).</p><p>
 4 recent cardiovascular disease the affirm study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or 
 unstable angina (in the past 3 months), new york heart association class (nyha) iii or iv heart 
 failure except if left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ≥ 45%, long qt, qtcf &gt; 470 ms, 
 bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension. this should be taken into account if xtandi is prescribed in 
 these patients.</p><p>
 use with chemotherapy 
 the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been 
 established.</p><p>
 excipients 
 xtandi contains sorbitol (e420). patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should 
 not take this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>potential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures</p><p>cyp2c8 inhibitors and inducers cyp2c8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. following oral administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice 
 daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide increased by 326% while c
 max of enzalutamide decreased by 18%. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active 
 metabolite, the auc increased by 77% while c
 max decreased by 19%. strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of cyp2c8 are to be avoided or used with caution during 
 enzalutamide treatment. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of 
 enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2).</p><p>cyp3a4 inhibitors and inducers cyp3a4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. following oral administration of the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of 
 enzalutamide increased by 41% while c
 max was unchanged. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased by 27% while c
 max was again unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of cyp3a4.</p><p>
 potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products</p><p>enzyme induction enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of 
 enzymes or transporters is expected. the reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and 
 lead to lost or reduced clinical effect. there is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. 
 enzymes that may be induced include cyp3a in the liver and gut, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp1a2 and 
 uridine 5&apos;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugts - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). the 
 transport protein p-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug 
 resistance-associated protein 2 (mrp2), breast cancer resistant protein (bcrp) and the organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1).</p><p> in vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4 and a moderate inducer 
 of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19. co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral 
 doses of sensitive cyp substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the auc 
 of midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the auc of s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), 
 and a 70% decrease in the auc of omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate). ugt1a1 may have been 
 induced as well.</p><p>
 5 interactions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport are expected. if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are 
 not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal 
 products are to be avoided or used with caution. the risk for liver injury after paracetamol 
 administration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers.</p><p>
 groups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to:</p><p>
 • analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) • antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) • anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) • anticoagulants (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin) • antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) • antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) • betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propanolol) • calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) • cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) • corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) • hiv antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) • hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) • statins metabolized by cyp3a4 (e.g. atorvastatine, simvastatin) • thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine)</p><p>
 the full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start 
 of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some 
 induction effects may be apparent earlier. patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of 
 cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp1a2 or ugt1a1 should be evaluated for possible loss of 
 pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during 
 the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. in 
 consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may 
 persist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. a gradual dose reduction of the 
 concomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>
 cyp2c8 substrates enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the auc or cmax of pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate). the auc of pioglitazone increased by 20% while c
 max decreased by 18%. no dose adjustment is indicated when a cyp2c8 substrate is co-administered with xtandi.</p><p>p-gp substrates</p><p>in vitro</p><p>data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-gp. the effect of enzalutamide on p-gp substrates has not been evaluated 
 in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer of p-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor 
 (pxr). medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for p-gp (e.g. colchicine, 
 dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
 xtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.</p><p>bcrp, mrp2, oat3 and oct1 substrates</p><p>based on in vitro data, inhibition of bcrp and mrp2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. 
 theoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.</p><p>
 effect of food on enzalutamide exposures 
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. in clinical trials, 
 xtandi was administered without regard to food.</p><p>

 contraception in males and females 
 it is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. a condom is required 
 during and for 3 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity 
 with a pregnant woman. if the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing 
 potential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after

 seizures in affirm, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas no seizures occurred in patients receiving placebo. potentially 
 contributing factors were present in several of these patients that may have independently increased 
 their risk of seizure. the affirm trial excluded patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure. 
 dose appears to be an important predictor of the risk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical data, and 
 data from a dose-escalation study. the mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure 
 threshold is not known, but could be related to data from 
 in vitro studies showing that enzalutamide and its active metabolite bind to and can inhibit the activity of the gaba-gated chloride channel.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions

 mechanism of action 
 prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor 
 signalling. despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling 
 continues to promote disease progression. stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor 
 requires nuclear localization and dna binding. enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling 
 8 inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. enzalutamide competitively inhibits binding of androgens to androgen receptors, inhibits nuclear translocation of 
 activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with dna even in 
 the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens. 
 enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death 
 and tumour regression. in preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 in a phase 3 clinical trial of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of patients 
 treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% decline 
 from baseline in psa levels.</p><p> 
 clinical efficacy and safety 
 the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
 who had received docetaxel and were using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) analogue or 
 had undergone orchiectomy were assessed in a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 
 clinical trial. a total of 1199 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a 
 dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 800) or placebo once daily (n = 399). patients were allowed but not 
 required to take prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). 
 patients randomised to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression (defined as 
 confirmed radiographic progression or the occurrence of a skeletal-related event) and initiation of new 
 systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.</p><p>
 the following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the 
 treatment arms. the median age was 69 years (range 41-92) and the racial distribution was 92.7% 
 caucasian, 3.9% black, 1.1% asian, and 2.1% other. the ecog performance score was 0-1 in 91.5% 
 of patients and 2 in 8.5% of patients; 28.4% had a mean brief pain inventory score of ≥4 (mean of 
 patient’s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours calculated for seven days prior to 
 randomization). most (91.2%) patients had metastases in bone and 23.2% had visceral lung and/or 
 liver involvement. at study entry, 41% of randomized patients had psa progression only, whereas 
 59% of patients had radiographic progression. 51% of patients were on bisphosphonates at baseline.</p><p>
 the phase 3 study excluded patients with medical conditions that may predispose them to seizures (see 
 section 4.8) and medicinal products known to decrease the seizure threshold, as well as clinically 
 significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent history of myocardial 
 infarction or unstable angina, new york heart association class iii or iv heart failure (unless ejection 
 fraction was ≥ 45%), clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or av block (without permanent 
 pacemaker).</p><p>
 of the 800 patients in the phase 3 trial who received enzalutamide, 568 patients (71%) were 65 years 
 and over and 199 patients (25%) were 75 years and over. no overall differences in safety or 
 effectiveness were observed between these older patients and younger patients.</p><p>
 the protocol pre-specified interim analysis after 520 deaths showed a statistically significant 
 superiority in overall survival in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo (table 2 and

 in addition to the observed improvement in overall survival, key secondary endpoints (psa 
 progression, radiographic progression-free survival, and time to first skeletal-related event) favoured 
 enzalutamide and were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing.</p><p> 
 radiographic progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator using recist v1.1 for soft 
 tissue and appearance of 2 or more bone lesions in bone scan was 8.3 months for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 2.9 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.404, 95% ci: [0.350, 0.466]); 
 p &lt; 0.0001). the analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented 
 progression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to 
 bone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions.</p><p>
 confirmed psa decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p &lt; 0.0001). the 
 median time to psa progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 
 3.0 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.248, 95% ci: [0.204, 0.303]; p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 the median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide 
 and 13.3 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.688, 95% ci: [0.566, 0.835]; p &lt; 0.0001). 
 a skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, 
 spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis involved 
 448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were 
 spinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change 
 in anti-neoplastic therapy to treat bone pain and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone.</p><p>
 the efficacy of enzalutamide in patients who have previously received abiraterone acetate has not 
 been studied.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 the european medicines agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
 enzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
 information on paediatric use).</p><p>
 11</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>enzalutamide is poorly water soluble. in this product, the solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. in preclinical studies, the absorption of 
 enzalutamide was increased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy 
 male subjects. the mean terminal half-life (t
 1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. with daily 
 oral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. daily 
 fluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). clearance of 
 enzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as 
 active as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as 
 enzalutamide.</p><p>
 absorption 
 maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) of enzalutamide in patients are observed 1 to 2 hours after administration. based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated 
 to be at least 84.2%. enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters p-gp or bcrp. at 
 steady state, the mean c
 max values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 μg/ml (23% coefficient of variation [cv]) and 12.7 μg/ml (30 %cv), respectively.</p><p>
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. in clinical trials, xtandi was 
 administered without regard to food.</p><p>
 distribution 
 the mean apparent volume of distribution (v/f) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 
 110 l (29% cv). the volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body 
 water, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide 
 and its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. the active metabolite is 
 95% bound to plasma proteins.</p><p>
 biotransformation</p><p>
 enzalutamide is extensively metabolized. there are two major metabolites in human plasma: 
 n-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). enzalutamide is 
 metabolized by cyp2c8 and to a lesser extent by cyp3a4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a 
 role in the formation of the active metabolite.</p><p>
 under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4, a moderate inducer of 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19, and has no clinically relevant effect on cyp2c8 (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 elimination 
 the mean apparent clearance (cl/f) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 l/h.</p><p>
 following oral administration of 
 14c-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of 
 enzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as 
 unchanged enzalutamide).</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for oatp1b1, oatp1b3, or oct1.</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oct2, or oat1.</p><p>
 12 linearity no major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. the 
 steady-state c
 min values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained constant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics 
 once steady-state is achieved.</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 no formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. patients with serum 
 creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) were excluded from clinical trials. based on a population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine 
 clearance (crcl) values ≥ 30 ml/min (estimated by the cockcroft and gault formula). enzalutamide 
 has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (crcl &lt; 30 ml/min) or end-stage 
 renal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. it is unlikely that enzalutamide will 
 be significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (n = 6) or 
 moderate (n = 8) hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b, respectively) and in 14 matched 
 control subjects with normal hepatic function. following a single oral 160 mg dose of enzalutamide, 
 the auc and c
 max for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% and 24%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. for the sum of 
 unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc and c
 max in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, compared to healthy control 
 subjects. the patients in the moderate hepatic impairment group however had only modest impairment 
 in parameters indicative of metabolic function (albumin, prothrombin time), and thus a larger effect in 
 other patients with moderate hepatic impairment cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh c) were excluded from clinical trials.</p><p>
 race 
 most patients in the clinical trials (&gt; 92%) were caucasian, thus no conclusions on the impact of race 
 on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics can be drawn.</p><p>
 older people 
 no clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>developmental or reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with enzalutamide, but in studies in rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4 and 13 weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, and 
 hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the reproductive system were noted, consistent with the pharmacological 
 activity of enzalutamide. in studies in rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4 and 13 weeks), changes in the 
 reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases in organ weight with atrophy of the 
 prostate and epididymis. additional changes to reproductive tissues included hypertrophy/hyperplasia 
 of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats and testicular hypospermia and 
 seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. gender differences were noted in rat mammary glands 
 (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). changes in the reproductive organs in both species 
 were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide and reversed or partially resolved 
 after an 8-week recovery period. there were no other important changes in clinical pathology or 
 histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either species.</p><p>
 enzalutamide did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (ames) assay and was not 
 clastogenic in either the 
 in vitro cytogenetic assay with mouse lymphoma cells or the in vivo mouse 13 micronucleus assay. long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of enzalutamide have not been conducted. enzalutamide was not phototoxic 
 in vitro.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>capsule contents caprylocaproyl macrogol-8 glycerides</p><p>
