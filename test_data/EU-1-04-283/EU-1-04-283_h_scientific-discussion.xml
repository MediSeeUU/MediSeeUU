 introduction</header><p>boehringer ingelheim international gmbh has submitted a marketing authorisation application through the centralised procedure, for the medicinal product ariclaim, containing duloxetine 
 hydrochloride, for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (sui) 
 this is a complete and independent marketing authorisation application, as stated in art. 8 (3) of 
 directive 2001/83/ec, as amended. the provided data cover all aspects of the clinical characterization 
 of safety and efficacy of duloxetine. the applicant has submitted the results of non-clinical and 
 clinical studies carried out for the application.</p><p>
 urinary incontinence is defined by the international continence society as the complaint of any 
 involuntary leakage of urine. it is a common and chronic condition in women. while not life-
 threatening, it can have a significant negative impact on the psychological well-being, social 
 functioning and overall quality of life of those affected. 
 urinary incontinence not only causes considerable personal discomfort but also has a relevant health 
 economic impact. it has been reported a median prevalence in adults (of any type or amount of 
 incontinence) of 28% (range, 12% to 42%) in women younger than 60 years, and 35% (range, 17% to 
 55%) in women 60 years and older. the prevalence of daily incontinence is 4% (range, 2% to 11%) in 
 women younger than 60 years, and 14% (range, 3% to 17%) in women 60 years and older.</p><p>
 among women younger than 60 years who reported incontinence, about half had stress incontinence. 
 for women 60 years and older, the rate of stress incontinence was lower, with only approximately 
 25% of incontinence due to stress; the remainder was caused by either urge or mixed urge-stress 
 incontinence. 
 urinary incontinence in women can be broadly divided into two main types: stress (effort) urinary 
 incontinence and urge incontinence. the term mixed incontinence denotes the concomitant appearance 
 of stress and urge incontinence.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence is defined by the international continence society as the complaint of 
 involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing (abrams et al. 2000).</p><p>
 anatomically, most sui results from diminished function of the pelvic floor structures that provide 
 support for the pelvic organs, leading to hypermobility and descent of the bladder and urethra. sui is 
 the most common type of urinary incontinence in women, with 78% of incontinent women presenting 
 with the symptom of sui in either pure (43%) or mixed (29%) forms.</p><p>
 in sui leakage appears when the intra-abdominal pressure increases above the forces contributing to 
 the urethral closure pressure. under resting condition paraurethral muscles usually maintain a pressure 
 (resting urethral closure pressure-rucp) that prevents leakage of urine. when intra-abdominal 
 pressure is increased above the rucp, in continent women the abdominal pressure is transmitted to 
 the urethra via surrounding tissues to maintain a positive ucp. a woman will leak urine on exertion if 
 pressure transmission is insufficient and the force (pressure generation) of the exertion is above the 
 ucp. thus, there are two factors that contribute to continence: the resting urethral pressure and the 
 transmission of pressure from outside to the urethra on exertion.</p><p>treatment of sui in sui surgery is generally regarded as the method with best chances of cure or significant improvement. 
 conservative and surgical treatments will depend on the patient’s preference, condition, and 
 urodynamic diagnosis.</p><p>
 conservative treatment is indicated when patients refuse or are undecided about surgery, they are 
 physically or mentally unfit for surgery, or childbearing is incomplete: 
 a) pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt) is a non-invasive method and should be considered as the first 
 option for all patients with stress incontinence. it concerns re-education of the pelvic floor muscles by 
 encouraging women to voluntarily contract their pelvic floor muscles. the overall rate for cure or 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 2/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 much improvement at five years is high. however, its success is reliant upon the patient’s motivation and commitment.</p><p>
 pfmt has been the subject of a recent cochrane review 
 1.</p><p>the reviewers conclude &quot;pelvic floor muscle training appeared to be an effective treatment for adult women with stress or mixed 
 incontinence. pelvic floor muscle training was better than no treatment or placebo treatment. the 
 limitations of the evidence available mean that it is difficult to judge if pelvic floor muscle training 
 was better or worse than other treatments. most trials to date have studied the effect of treatment in 
 younger, premenopausal women.&quot; the reviewers also state &quot;long term results of pelvic floor muscle 
 training are unclear. side effects of pelvic floor muscle training were uncommon and reversible.&quot;</p><p>
 in the cochrane review, studies that compared pfmt with no treatment in sui have been pooled. self 
 reported 
 cure appeared in 17% of treated women and in 2% of untreated women. self reported cure or improvement</p><p>was reported in 79% of treated versus 3.5% of untreated women. both differences were highly statistically significant, as was the reduction in the number of incontinence episodes. the 
 review also concluded, based on three trials, that pfmt is better than placebo treatment.</p><p>however, 
 only one of the three placebo-controlled trials was a blinded trial using an imitation pfmt regimen.</p><p>it 
 showed identical responses for the real and placebo pfmt regimens.</p><p>the results of this study are 
 supported by the results of the applicant’s study sbaf, considered later in this summary.</p><p>the other 
 two placebo-controlled trials sited in the cochrane report did not use a control for pfmt.</p><p>one used a 
 placebo pill in an urge incontinent population and the second used an inactive electrical stimulation 
 device in a stress incontinent population. 
 b) devices such as electrical stimulation (stimulation of the pudendal nerve with electrodes placed in 
 the vagina or anus), elevating devices (that support the bladder neck) or occlusive devices (for 
 occluding the urethra) are also been employed. compliance seems to be a major problem, and patient 
 also needs sufficient manual dexterity. side effects include urinary tract infections, and soreness of the 
 vaginal mucosa. 
 c) surgery is indicated when conservative treatment fails or the patient wants definitive treatment. the 
 different techniques of continence surgery aim to elevate and stabilise the bladder neck and urethra via 
 either the vaginal or abdominal route; sling techniques that provide midurethral support, and 
 techniques that provide urethral compression increasing its resistance. in general, the first attempt at 
 continence surgery produces better results than repeat procedures. clinical features, urodynamic data, 
 and operation characteristics influence the choice of surgery, and the success rates vary.</p><p>
 meta-analyses of published studies indicate that anterior repair procedures provide similar short-term 
 results to colposuspension; however, long-term efficacy is of the order of 40%. the immediate and 
 long-term results of colposuspension and various sling procedures appear similar with efficacy in the 
 70 to 90% range.</p><p>side effects include prolapse, suture pain or infection, new detrusor instability or 
 lower tract damage.</p><p>
 no pharmacological treatment has been widely approved for the treatment of women with sui. 
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht, 5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake 
 inhibitor (snri). it weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake and has no significant affinity for 
 histaminergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic or adrenergic receptors. due to its neuromodulatory 
 action, duloxetine is believed to increase urethral tone and probably bladder capacity and thereby 
 reduces stress urinary incontinence (sui).</p><p>

 duloxetine is intended for women with stress urinary incontinence (sui). 
 the effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of sui is belived to be linked to its inhibition of

 γ-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine hydrochloride is a white to practically white solid, and is slightly soluble in 
 water; its solubility is not ph dependent. 
 the chemical structure of duloxetine hydrochloride is well characterised. it is an optically active 
 molecule, which presents 1 asymmetric carbon, therefore two enantiomers are possible. the s 
 enantiomer has been selected based on both 
 in vitro and in vivo studies. selecting the correct chiral starting materials controls the optical purity of the drug substance. according to the manufacturing 
 process described, the s-enantiomer is routinely obtained and the r-enantiomer is considered as a 
 specified impurity. 
 two manufacturing processes synthesize duloxetine hydrochloride. both processes are equivalent. 
 batch analysis data allow for the conclusion that the analytical profiles are similar between batches.</p><p>
 adequate in-process controls are applied during the manufacture of duloxetine active substance. the 
 specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have 
 been presented and are satisfactory
 . active substance specifications 
 the active substance specification includes tests for physical characteristics of the active substance,, identity , assay, process and product related impurities, as well as additional pharmacopoeia testing 
 requirements consistent with this dosage form. . 
 the specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance and were found to be 
 adequate to control the quality of the drug substance.</p><p>
 batch analysis data of a number of batches of active substance are provided. the results are within the 
 specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
 stability stability studies for primary batches (manufactured by one of two alternative processes) from storage under long term ich conditions (30°c/60%rh) up to 24 months and under stress conditions (40ºc / 
 75% rh) up to 6 months were provided. supportive data was provided in terms of data from six 
 batches manufactured by the same process as for the primary batches and for six batches manufactured 
 by the second process. the batches were packed in a linear low-density polyethylene liner (lldpe) 
 placed inside a laminated foil liner. the parameters evaluated were stability indicating. methods are 
 validated and stability indicating.</p><p>
 the re-test period proposed is acceptable taking into account the results obtained in formal stability 
 studies and the supportive stability data.</p><p>

 included in compendial monographs.</p><p>
 analytical certificates of excipients are included. specifications and analytical certificates for the 
 capsules and the printing ink are presented. 
 animal-derived products utilised in the manufacturing process met compliance standards for the 
 control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (tse). the gelatin used in the capsules shell is 
 complies with emea/chmp/4306/00 and chmp/bwp/1230/98 for sourcing and processing of 
 gelatin for the control of tse in products for human use. tse certificates of suitability are presented. 
 duloxetine capsules are packaged in polyvinylchloride (pvc), polyethylene (pe), and 
 polychlorotrifluoroethylene (pctfe) blisters sealed with an aluminium foil. the choice of materials 
 for the container is adequate for the type of product and moreover supported by the stability studies 
 performed.</p></section><section><header>product development and finished product</header><p>duloxetine hydrochloride is acid-labile substance; therefore, the product development has been focus to develop an enteric-coated dosage form in order to prevent degradation of the active substance in the 
 acidic environment of the stomach. hard gastro-resistant capsules with enteric-coated pellets were 
 selected after development of some formulations to be the optimal market formulation. 
 the product is manufactured in accordance to conventional processes for this pharmaceutical form. 
 the manufacturing process has been adequately validated by a number of studies for the major steps 
 of the manufacturing process in three batches produced for stability studies and clinical trials. 
 the validation show that the hard capsules can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed 
 finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation 
 product specification the specification includes tests by validated methods for physical appearance, identity assay product and process related impurities, as well as additional pharmacopeia testing requirements consistent with 
 this dosage form.</p><p>
 the test and limits of the release and shelf life specification for the finished product are appropriate to 
 control the quality of this medicinal product for its intended purpose. 
 batch data are provided for pilot and production batches and indicate satisfactory uniformity as well as 
 compliance with the specification.</p></section><section><header>stability of the finished product</header><p>36 months data generated under ich conditions are presented in the primary stability study. the parameters evaluated were stability indicating. a supplementary stability study was also conducted to 
 address the effect of the capsule shell colours in stability. 
 photostability testing was conducted according to the ich guideline for photostability testing of new 
 active substances and medicinal products. the results indicate that the drug substance in the capsule 
 formulation is chemically stable with respect to light. 
 based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the spc 
 are acceptable.</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. the results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
 consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
 conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.</p><p>

 introduction</header><p>duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor (snri) that weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake and has no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, 
 and cholinergic or adrenergic receptors. due to its neuromodulatory action, duloxetine is believed to 
 increase urethral tone and probably bladder capacity and thereby reduces sui. however, the applicant 
 has not been able to properly describe the mechanism of action of duloxetine in patients with sui, and 
 additional studies are considered necessary in order to further elucidate it.</p><p>the excipients used in the formulation of the product are generally recognised as safe (gras) 
 compounds, with the exception of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, and are widely 
 used in oral pharmaceutical preparations.</p><p>
 studies carried out to assess general pharmacodynamics and toxicology of hydroxypropyl 
 methylcellulose acetate succinate indicate that it is poorly absorbed and is excreted predominantly in 
 the faeces, with no significant toxic effects and therefore, does not appear to pose a toxicological 
 liability as an enteric coating for duloxetine capsule. 
 the applicant has submitted extensive documentation concerning nonclinical pharmacology and 
 toxicology of duloxetine, as well as for related substances and impurities, and excipients included in 
 the formulation.</p><p>
 the development programme of duloxetine was long, with initial toxicology studies being conducted 
 in the mid-1980s. the first directive concerning the application of the good laboratory practices 
 (glps) in non-clinical studies carried out with chemical and pharmaceutical products dates 1987 
 (87/18/eec) and therefore, several non-clinical studies were not carried out specifically under glp 
 standards. studies previously conducted included in this dossier were carried out following previously 
 established analitic procedures, with an extensively description of the material and methods used, and 
 reviewed by the scientific commitee where these studies were published, that guarantee their quality. 
 the rest of the studies were performed in accordance with good laboratory practise standards.</p></section><section><header>pharmacology</header><p>• primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo) reuptake by nerve endings is thought to be a primary mechanism for removing monoamines from the synapse and terminating their effects at pre- and post-synaptic receptors. therefore, blockade of 
 reuptake may increase synaptic levels of monoamines and enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission. 
 the effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of sui is linked to its inhibition of presynaptic neuron 
 reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, resulting in elevated levels of 
 serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft.</p><p>
 • in vitro studies</p><p>in vitro, duloxetine inhibits the uptake of 5-ht and ne.</p><p>it weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake and has no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic or adrenergic receptors. 
 furthermore, duloxetine has relatively weak affinity in vitro for other neuronal receptors and binding 
 sites. none of the various hydroxy-substituted compounds had appreciable affinity for the 5-ht, ne 
 and dopamine transporters. the r (-) enantiomer of duloxetine, was also a potent inhibitor of 5-ht 
 and ne reuptake. 
 studies evaluating the pharmacodynamic potential of metabolites and/or degradation products of 
 duloxetine were performed. although several potential metabolites, in addition to the 1-naphthol acid 
 degradation product, bound to neurotransmitter receptors, none of the circulating metabolites have 
 demonstrable pharmacological activity.</p><p>
 • in vivo studies</p><p>pharmacodynamics directly related to the molecule must be inferred for claims toward the intended 
 clinical utility of duloxetine, as specific animal models for stress urinary incontinence are not 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 6/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 available. the models described provide indirect pharmacological evidence for the potential clinical efficacy of the molecule. 
 the effects of duloxetine on lower urinary tract function were evaluated in the cat animal model. 
 duloxetine produced dose-dependent increases in</p><p>bladder capacity in all 9 cats tested, to about five 
 times the capacity seen under control conditions. 
 peri-urethral muscle emg activity increased dose-dependently, following administration of 
 duloxetine. during the filling phase of the cystomyogram (cmg) profile, activity increased up to 8 
 times control levels at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg with larger doses producing no greater effect on average. 
 this increase in emg activity was seen in all 9 cats. the effects on urinary bladder activity were 
 centrally mediated, since bladder contractions evoked by electrical stimulation of efferent fibers in the 
 pelvic nerve were not affected by duloxetine. the increases in urinary bladder capacity and sphincter 
 emg activity produced by duloxetine are effects that would promote normalisation of urinary bladder 
 function, thereby preventing the accidental loss of urine as seen in sui.</p><p>
 • secondary pharmacodynamics since 5-ht and ne are implicated in enhancing/mediating endogenous analgesic mechanisms, effects 
 of duloxetine in chronic and acute pain were evaluated in several animal models. results of these 
 studies indicated that duloxetine was effective in models of persistent inflammatory or neuropathic 
 pain, but not in models of acute pain. duloxetine’s activity in the behavioural assays and in 
 antidepressant models indicates enhancement of 5-ht and ne neurotransmission, in agreement with 
 its mechanism of action. moreover, duloxetine was found to decrease food consumption in a variety of 
 rodent models.</p><p>
 • safety pharmacology the potential of duloxetine to alter cardiovascular, central nervous system (cns), smooth muscle, 
 renal, immune, and gastrointestinal motility functions, as well as its potential for substance abuse was 
 examined as part of the safety pharmacology dossier provided by the applicant.</p><p>
 cardiovascular effects: 
 in vitro, duloxetine maleate had no effect on the function of the smooth and cardiac muscles at concentrations of 10
 -6 m and lower, while antagonistic effects were observed at concentrations of 10
 -5 and above. duloxetine did not affect smooth or cardiac muscle function of rat and guinea pig at concentrations of 1 nm to 1 
 µm. cardiac ion channel results, together with qt measurements from dogs and humans would not pose an 
 arrhythmogenic risk with the use of duloxetine.</p><p>
 central nervous system effects:</p><p>duloxetine would not be predicted to substantively affect cns. it did 
 not adversely affect cns function of mice after single oral doses 3 mg/kg. at higher doses (10 and 
 30 mg/kg) an increase in hexobarbital-induced time sleep was observed, indicating that duloxetine 
 may produce cns depression or interfere with hexobarbital metabolism. moreover, an increase in 
 seizure threshold in electroshock-induced convulsions was observed at the highest dose. comparable 
 changes have been obtained following multiple dosing (5 days). mydriasis has been reported in 
 association with duloxetine treatment.</p><p>
 gastrointestinal, renal and inmunological effects: there were no important effects on gastrointestinal 
 motility or immune functions in mice. regarding renal function, no effects on urine volume were 
 observed in rats based on the studies provided by the applicant. however, a slight elevation of serum 
 potassium levels and an increase in sodium excretion were observed with 10 and 20 mg/kg doses.</p><p>
 potential for abuse: the abuse potential of duloxetine was evaluated in monkeys and rats; duloxetine 
 demonstrated the above mentioned cns effects in rats, but not in rhesus monkeys up to 64 mg/kg 
 doses. duloxetine also did not demonstrate cross physical dependence potential with barbital or 
 physical dependence-producing potential. as such, duloxetine would not be expected to pose a risk for 
 substance abuse. 
 based upon the results of these studies, therapeutically relevant doses of duloxetine would not be 
 predicted to substantively affect cns, smooth muscle, renal, immune, or gastrointestinal functions, 
 neither would be expected to pose a risk for substance abuse. potential secondary pharmacologic 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 7/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 reactions at clinical doses would be limited to potential increases in pulmonary pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and respiratory rate. however, these effects are attributable to the known actions 
 of norepinephrine and serotonin (brunner and gross 1979; garattini and valzelli 1965; weiner 1985), 
 and were only observed in anaesthetised animals.</p><p>
 • pharmacodynamic drug interactions conventional drug-drug interaction studies showed no evidence of clinically important increases in 
 adverse effects in patients when duloxetine was coadministered with lorazepam, ethanol, famotidine, 
 aminophylline, desipramine, or paroxetine. duloxetine does not exacerbate the adverse cognitive and 
 psychomotor effects of ethanol but it appears to exacerbate the sedative effects of lorazepam. caution 
 is advised when duloxetine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs or substances, 
 especially those with a similar mechanism of action, and including alcohol. 
 duloxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar 
 disorder, and/or seizures, when taken in combination with lorazepam or other centrally acting drugs 
 with a similar mechanism of action as that of duloxetine.</p><p>
 • summary of salient findings the rationale for the development and application for marketing approval of the duloxetine 
 formulation is well established. in vitro, duloxetine was an inhibitor of both serotonin and 
 norepinephrine reuptake and a relatively weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. the molecule was 
 active in urinary models indicative of enhancement of serotonin and norepinephrine 
 neurotransmission, with improvement of capacity of the urinary bladder and increased urinary 
 sphincter activity 
 these results from in vivo studies indicate that duloxetine-induced inhibition of 5-ht and ne 
 reuptake suppresses urinary bladder muscular activity in a dose-dependent manner, and enhances 
 external urethral sphincter activity through centrally mediated (cns) mechanism.</p><p>
 at therapeutic range, duloxetine is not expected to pose a risk on cns, smooth muscle, renal, immune, 
 or gastrointestinal functions. substance abuse is unlikely. 
 the extent and scope of the documentation provided in this application are appropriate to support the 
 non-clinical-pharmacology profile of duloxetine 
 all the non-clinical-pharmacology information provided is supported by relevant bibliographical 
 references.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>the applicant has conducted a number of studies concerning the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of duloxetine in mice, rats, and dogs. only limited metabolism and excretion were 
 evaluated in the monkey, since the dog had been chosen as the nonrodent species for use in the 
 toxicology programme.</p><p>radiolabeled drug was administered in the pharmacokinetic, metabolism, 
 excretion, and tissue distribution studies. the plasma protein binding of 
 14
 c-duloxetine has been 
 determined in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma. additional studies have investigated the placental 
 transfer of 
 14
 c-duloxetine in rats and the excretion of 
 14
 c-duloxetine into milk of lactating rats.</p><p>
 • absorption- bioavailability the applicant has conducted a number of studies concerning absorption of duloxetine in several 
 animal species. duloxetine was well absorbed in these species after gavage or dietary administration 
 after oral administration, duloxetine is well absorbed but extensively metabolised, tmax being approx. 
 1.5 hours in mice and rats. absorption was found to be greatest from the duodenum and least from the 
 stomach. additionally, pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were similar in fed and fasted male rats. 
 bioavailability was determined to be 21% in rats and 5% in dogs, probably due to extensive 
 metabolism in the latter. 
 no consistent gender differences in exposure occurred in dogs, although female rats tended to have 
 higher exposure than male rats and male mice had greater values than female mice, but only at the 
 highest doses tested. even though the auc values increased with increasing doses in mice, rats and 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 8/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 dogs, these increases were not always proportional at the higher doses. additionally, there was no evidence of accumulation with increasing duration of exposure.</p><p>
 • distribution with respect to the distribution of duloxetine, several studies using quantitative whole-body 
 autoradiography (qwba) and tissue dissection studies techniques were performed. duloxetine was 
 highly bound to proteins in plasma, the mean percent bound to human plasma proteins at a duloxetine 
 concentration of 150.2 ng/ml being 95.9% 
 duloxetine was present in high concentrations in the stomach and intestinal contents at 3 to 12 hours 
 postdose. kidney, liver, and lung contained the highest tissue concentrations.</p><p>
 duloxetine and/or its metabolites were distributed into breast milk of rats and does undergo placental 
 transfer. therefore, embryonic tissues were exposed to duloxetine and its metabolites during the 
 period of organogenesis in the embryo-foetal toxicity studies. although there was no embryo-
 foetotoxicity effect observed, delay in postnatal development was reported. in conclusion, duloxetine 
 should not be administered during pregnancy as well as the breast-feeding period.</p><p>
 • metabolism</p><p>the applicant has performed a number of studies concerning metabolism of duloxetine in mice, rats, 
 dogs and monkeys. after oral administration, duloxetine was well absorbed, but extensively 
 metabolised regardless of the salt form. overall, the liver was determined to be the primary organ 
 responsible for the metabolism of duloxetine. in all animal species, the major biotransformation 
 pathways involve several oxidations, especially in the naphthyl ring followed by further oxidation and 
 conjugation or formation of a dihydrodiol. additional reactions involved cleavage at the ether linkage 
 to form thienyl derivatives and naphthol. 
 some differences related to the metabolic profile and exposure exists between animal’s species and 
 humans.</p><p>
 duloxetine was a mixed cytochrome p-450 inducer in all species tested, at higher doses cyp1a and 
 cyp2b were induced), but there was no significant induction of cyp1a2 or cyp3a in cultured 
 human hepatocytes. both cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 participate in the biotransformation of 4-hydroxy 
 and 5-hydroxy duloxetine, suggesting that the clearance of duloxetine would be related to the levels 
 and activities of both of these enzymes.</p><p>
 • excretion the applicant in mouse, rat, dog and human performed several excretion studies</p><p>
 the excretion profile was similar after either oral or intravenous administration to rats and dogs, 
 which indicates that duloxetine was well absorbed and that elimination was not affected by the route 
 of administration. duloxetine was cleared rapidly primarily by metabolism in all species tested, and 
 one or more of its metabolites has an extended elimination phase. 
 mice, rats, and dogs excreted the majority of a single oral dose of 
 14
 c-duloxetine in the faeces, 
 whereas humans excreted a larger amount of the dose in urine. further, approximately 66% of the 
 radioactivity excreted in the bile is reabsorbed in rats, indicating that enterohepatic circulation of 
 metabolite(s) likely contributes to the extended elimination phase of radioactivity in the animal 
 species.</p><p>
 • pharmacokinetic drug interactions duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6, and therefore, caution is advisable if administering 
 duloxetine together with other cyp2d6 inhibitors. concomitant use of duloxetine with drugs 
 undergoing cyp2d6 metabolism may result in higher concentrations of the latter. there was no 
 significant induction of cyp1a2 or cyp3a in cultured human hepatocytes. concomitant use of 
 duloxetine with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2will result in higher concentrations of duloxetine and 
 therefore co-administration is not recommended.</p><p>

 emea 2005 • summary of pharmacokinetic parameters</p><p>the applicant has appropriately described the non-clinical pharmacokinetics properties for duloxetine. 
 a number of studies concerning the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of duloxetine 
 in mice, rats, and dogs have been performed. 
 rats might be suggested to be the most appropriate species for toxicology studies since major 
 biotransformation pathways for duloxetine, in female rats as in man, were similar. however, mice and 
 dogs are also valuable since exposure to specific human circulating metabolites could be seen in their 
 plasma.</p><p>
 duloxetine was well absorbed in the mentioned species, and absorption was maximum at the 
 duodenum. it did not show evidence of accumulation when duration of exposure increased. 
 duloxetine presented high protein binding across all species. although it is not widely distributed it 
 crosses the blood-brain barrier, undergoes placental transfer and is excreted into milk. 
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised, primarily by the liver.

 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>duloxetine hydrochloride has been evaluated in a variety of toxicology studies in laboratory animals and in vitro test systems. studies included single-dose toxicity in mice, rats, and dogs; repeated-dose 
 toxicity in mice, rats, and dogs; in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity; carcinogenic potential in mice and 
 rats; and reproductive and developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits.</p><p>
 all toxicity studies were performed according to glp.</p><p>
 • single-dose toxicity single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with duloxetine hydrochloride and duloxetine maleate in 
 mice, rats and dogs using oral administration, the intended clinical route. in general, the toxicologic 
 effects seen in the three species were extensions of the pharmacology of duloxetine. the primary 
 findings following oral administration were related to central nervous system (cns) effects (i.e., 
 tremors, convulsions, emesis, mydriasis, salivation, and hyper-responsiveness).</p><p>
 the median lethal doses in mice were approximately 300-400 mg/kg, and in rats 500-600 mg/kg 
 (males) and 300-500 mg/kg (female). in dogs, no deaths occurred at the maximum tested dose of 100 
 mg/kg.</p><p>
 • repeat-dose toxicity</p><p>repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with duloxetine hydrochloride and duloxetine maleate in 
 mice, rats and dogs using dietary (mice and rats) or gavage (dogs) administration. altogether eight 
 studies were performed. 
 based on the results provided by the applicant, the most relevant adverse events, target organ-related 
 to duloxetine administration in all species tested was the liver, with signs occurring at or below the 
 clinical exposure in all animal species investigated. the changes observed in this target organ did not 
 appear to be indicative of toxicity, and they could have been a consequence of hepatic induction. 
 major findings were increased liver weights, moderate induction of hepatic enzymes (cyp1a1 and 
 cyp2b) and slight to moderate centrilobular hypertrophy. slight lipofuscin pigmentation was also 
 noted in male mice.</p><p>
 • genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo</p><p>duloxetine maleate and duloxetine hydrochloride were not mutagenic when tested at appropriate 
 doses in a battery of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo studies that included all relevant positive 
 controls. all studies were performed with duloxetine hydrochloride or maleate according to glp. 
 there was no evidence of induced mutation by treatment with duloxetine maleate and duloxetine 
 hydrochloride when tested. 
 taking into account the results of these studies, duloxetine can be considered as a non-genotoxic 
 substance.</p><p>
 • carcinogenicity</p><p>the oncogenic/carcinogenic potential of duloxetine hydrochloride was evaluated in both mice and 
 rats. the studies were performed according to glp.</p><p>
 a dose dependent increase in the percentage of cells with diplochromosomes</p><p>was seen in the in vitro 
 chromosomal aberration test in cho cells. hepatocytes with more than one nucleus are a common 
 histological finding. however, hepatocytes with more than 2-3 nuclei are rare. 
 multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the rat carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism 
 is unknown. the multinucleated hepatocytes were observed as a dose-related effect in the rat 
 carcinogenicity study without any sign of other pathological changes observed in the hepatocytes. no 
 genotoxicity or hepatic tumourigenesis were observed. no multinucleated hepatocytes were seen in 
 either the mouse or dog, which indicates a species-specific effect in the rat. however, the clinical 
 relevance of this finding is unknown. to properly reflect this information, the following text is 
 included in section 5.3 of the spc: “ multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other 
 histopathological changes</p><p>in the rat carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical 
 relevance are unknown.”</p><p>

 emea 2005 • reproductive and developmental studies fertility studies were conducted by the applicant to test reproductive performance in both male and 
 female rats. duloxetine had no effect on male fertility and effects in females were only evident at 
 doses that caused maternal toxicity. furthermore, foetal viability and morphology were not adversely 
 affected by treatment. in a pre/postnatal toxicity study in rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural 
 effects in the offspring at systemic exposures levels below maximum clinical exposure (auc).</p><p>in an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal 
 malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels below the maximun clinical exposure (auc). 
 no malformations were observed in another study testing a higher dose of a different salt of 
 duloxetine. as a consequence of this, duloxetine is contraindicated during pregnancy.</p><p>
 • local tolerance</p><p>fischer 344 rats given daily 30-minute intravenous infusions at doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg had findings 
 of excessive irritation at the injection sites. systemic toxicity was not observed in rats given 
 1 mg/kg/day for 15 days. similarly, daily 30-minute intravenous infusions to beagle dogs at doses of 
 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg had no evidence of systemic toxicity. however, local irritation at the injection sites 
 precluded dosing of the 5-mg/kg/day group for longer than 10 days.</p><p>
 • other toxicity studies the potential for immunogenicity and hypersensitivity-eliciting antigenicity of duloxetine was 
 evaluated in a number of studies in guinea pigs and mice. duloxetine was not immunogenic and does 
 not possess hypersensitivity-eliciting antigenicity in any of the studies performed. these results 
 indicate that the risk of duloxetine causing adverse allergic reactions is negligible. 
 the abuse potential of duloxetine was evaluated in monkeys and rats. duloxetine did not demonstrate 
 cross physical dependence potential with barbital or physical dependence-producing potential, or any 
 reinforcing effects. the results from studies specifically designed to examine abuse potential indicate 
 that duloxetine would not be expected to pose a risk for substance abuse. 
 the enteric coating, hpmcas, has no evidence of absorption; further, hpmcas has been widely 
 used in medicinal products for oral use in several countries and therefore would not pose any 
 toxicological concern. 
 an environmental risk assessment was submitted. although duloxetine would be regarded as a 
 medium risk for aquatic organisms, a low potential for bioaccumulation is observed. further, 
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised to metabolites that lack pharmacological activity, and therefore 
 substantive excretion of duloxetine from humans is not expected; thus, duloxetine would not pose an 
 environmental concern.</p></section><section><header>discussion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>extensive documentation concerning nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of duloxetine has been submitted, as well as for related substances and impurities, and excipients included in the formulation.</p><p>
 the data presented by the applicant has been adequately supported by relevant literature references. 
 the effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of sui is linked to its inhibition of presynaptic 
 neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, resulting in elevated 
 levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. this suppresses urinary bladder muscular 
 activity in a cat animal model in a dose-dependent manner, and enhances external urethral sphincter 
 activity through centrally mediated (cns) mechanism.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology studies on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal 
 system, immune system and the kidney have been performed. at therapeutic range, duloxetine is not 
 expected to pose a risk on cns, smooth muscle, renal, immune, or gastrointestinal functions, and 
 substance abuse is unlikely. 
 duloxetine is well absorbed in all studied species, and is extensively metabolised, especially in the 
 liver. 
 for the treatment of sui duloxetine is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 12/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 duloxetine was not shown to be genotoxic or carcinogenic in the studies performed, but multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the rat carcinogenicity study a species-specific effect, the 
 clinical relevance of this finding being unknown. these findings are reflected in the spc.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical aspects 
  
 introduction</header><p>the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of duloxetine have been assessed in healthy subjects, special populations, and patients with either stress urinary incontinence (sui) or 
 major depressive disorder (mdd). the pharmacokinetic data were available from at least 250 healthy 
 subjects, 12 subjects with end-stage renal disease (esrd), and 6 subjects with cirrhosis in 19 clinical 
 pharmacology studies and at least 421 patients in four phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. nearly half 
 of the subjects (45%) in the clinical pharmacology studies were women.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine have been characterised in healthy men and women over a single-dose range of 20 mg to 60 mg and over a multiple-dose range of 40 mg/day to 160 mg/day. 
 for the majority of the studies, duloxetine concentrations were determined using validated high 
 performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (hplc/ms/ms) methods. the assay 
 was validated over the concentrations range of 0.5 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml with higher concentrations 
 obtained after dilution of the samples. in some studies, the two major metabolites of duloxetine - the 
 glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and the sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy 
 duloxetine - were determined. the metabolite concentrations were obtained using a validated 
 hplc/ms/ms method over the concentration range of 1 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml. the overall relative 
 standard deviation (a measure of precision) and absolute relative error (a measure of accuracy) were 
 less than 10% for both assays. duloxetine and its two major metabolites were found to be stable in 
 plasma stored frozen for the length of time that the study samples were stored under similar 
 conditions.</p><p>
 • absorption – bioavailability results from mass balance studies indicate a fairly high extent of absorption (&gt;70%) of duloxetine. 
 duloxetine is a delayed release formulation (capsules containing enteric-coated pellets), and as a 
 result, t
 max occurs rather late, at about 6 hours.</p><p>the absolute oral bioavailability was estimated to a mean of 50%, but individual results ranged between 32 and 80%.</p><p>
 bioequivalence between the clinical trial and the marketing formulations of duloxetine was 
 demonstrated using a 60 mg dose, i.e. not the dose or strength intended for marketing (40 mg). this is 
 acceptable, since all strengths of the final formulation contain the same enteric-coated pellets. when 
 administered with a high-fat meal, there was a 6% decrease in c
 max and an 11% decrease in auc0-∞ the absorption was delayed by food, with an increase in tmax of about 4 hours. a specific dose recommendation with respect to food intake is not considered warranted based on this.</p><p>
 • distribution duloxetine has an extensive tissue distribution and is highly bound to plasma proteins. different 
 figures have been reported, but the degree of binding was generally above 95%. duloxetine is bound 
 both to albumin and to 
 α-acid glycoprotein (aagp). since aagp is a protein with variable plasma concentrations, within and between patients, e.g. due to disease states like infections, this could be a 
 source of variability in the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. 
 the urinary metabolites of duloxetine were moderately bound to plasma proteins and this binding was 
 unaffected by the presence of duloxetine. 
 protein binding is not affected by end-stage renal disease (esrd) or by hepatic impairment, and is 
 independent of duloxetine concentration.</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 13/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 • elimination duloxetine is predominantly eliminated in the urine after undergoing extensive metabolism to 
 numerous metabolites that are pharmacologically inactive. 
 comparison of the metabolite-to-parent ratio values after iv and oral duloxetine reveal that a larger 
 fraction of the drug is metabolised upon oral administration, likely reflecting first-pass metabolism.</p><p>
 the major biotransformation pathways involve oxidation in the naphthyl ring, followed by further 
 oxidation, methylation, and conjugation. the two major circulating metabolites of duloxetine are the 
 glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and the sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy 
 duloxetine. the cytochrome p450 isoenzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of duloxetine 
 seem to be cyp1a2 and cyp2d6 based on 
 in vitro and in vivo data. both cyp1a2 and cyp2d6 were</p><p>identified as participants in the hydroxylation at 4 and 5 positions, the two dominant</p><p>routes of 
 duloxetine metabolism. should the activity of one of cyp1a2 and cyp2d6 be</p><p>absent or decreased in 
 a subject, the other enzyme would be available to metabolise duloxetine. no unchanged duloxetine is 
 excreted in urine.</p><p>
 in vitro studies indicate that neither of these metabolites contributes to the pharmacologic activity of duloxetine. 
 hepatic impairment results in a decrease in the formation of the metabolites, which leads to higher 
 plasma concentrations of duloxetine. in contrast, renal impairment (end stage renal disease treated 
 with chronic haemodialysis) reduces their rate of elimination as evidenced by the longer t½ values of 
 the metabolites.</p><p>
 • dose proportionality and time dependencies dose proportionality has been assessed in several studies over a dose range covering the proposed 
 dosage for ariclaim (80 mg/day). these analyses, suggest that higher duloxetine doses are associated 
 with slightly lower cl/f and, correspondingly, the average steady-state concentrations at higher doses 
 are slightly higher than would be projected for a dose-proportional increase. nevertheless, the 
 magnitude of the deviation from either strictly linear pharmacokinetic behaviour or dose-proportional 
 increases across dose is small, particularly in comparison to the degree of interindividual variability in 
 plasma concentrations. most importantly, within any individual subject, the deviations from classical 
 linearity or dose-proportionality appear to be very small in magnitude. thus, the apparent slight non-
 linear behaviour and more-than-proportional increase in plasma concentration across the duloxetine 
 dosage range of 40 mg/day to 120 mg/day are unlikely to be clinically important.</p><p>steady state is generally reached within 3-5 days.</p><p>
 • special populations hepatic impairment: a study using a single low (20 mg) dose was used to study the effect of moderate 
 (child-pugh class b) hepatic cirrhosis on the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and the major 
 metabolites. however, the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites were not studied in 
 patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. a clear effect was observed after the single dose, 
 with an almost 5-fold increase in auc
 0-∞ and a 3-fold longer t½ of duloxetine. the mean plasma protein binding was lower in the hepatically impaired subjects (not statistically significant, though), 
 indicating an even larger difference in mean unbound exposure. the subjects included had moderate 
 cirrhosis according the child-pugh classification, with scores of 7 or 8. thus, there is an effect of 
 hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine even at a quite moderate degree of severity.</p><p>
 the spc specifies that duloxetine should not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic 
 impairment.</p><p>
 renal impairment: pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate 
 renal impairment. there seems to be no correlation between clcr and duloxetine cl/f in patients 
 with no renal impairment and mild and moderate renal impairment. pharmacokinetic data in patients 
 with mild and moderate renal impairment were obtained from phase iii population pharmacokinetic 
 studies.</p><p>
 a doubled exposure to duloxetine and several-fold increases in exposure of the inactive metabolites 
 was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, but this patient group is unlikely to experience 
 sui.</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 14/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 despite the fact that duloxetine is not renally eliminated, there was a substantial effect on duloxetine pharmacokinetics with a doubled exposure of duloxetine and a 2 to 9-fold increase for the two major 
 metabolites.</p><p>
 based on these considerations no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate 
 renal dysfunction, and as such that is noted in the spc. 
 age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (
 ≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. 
 gender: gender has an effect on the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine, with females having 
 approximately twice as high exposure compared with males. however, many pharmacokinetic studies 
 were performed in males and the results may, thus, not be immediately extrapolated to females. it is 
 agreed that the isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of duloxetine, i.e. cyps 1a2 and 2d6 are not 
 sex-specific. bearing this in mind, it cannot be excluded that a different effect of duloxetine on a cyp1a2 substrate would be observed in females as compared to males. a study investigating the 
 effect of duloxetine on the pharmacokinetics of a cyp1a2 substrate, e.g. theophylline, is to be 
 performed also in females.</p><p>
 • interaction studies in vitro data show that cyp2d6 has been shown to be non-inducible and that duloxetine may inhibit 
 cyp3a, cyp1a2, or cyp2c9 at concentrations substantially higher than those anticipated in the 
 clinical setting. it is unlikely that enzyme induction would occur clinically. 
 in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been carried out with cyp2d6 substrates (desipramine and 
 tolterodine), cyp2d6 inhibitors (paroxetine), cyp1a2 substrates (theophylline), cyp1a2 inhibitors 
 (fluvoxamine), and other drugs and substances likely to be co-administered with duloxetine 
 (lorazepam, temazepam, ethanol and antacids). duloxetine has shown to be a moderate cyp2d6 
 inhibitor (3-fold increase in the overall exposure to desipramine and 2-fold increase to tolterodine). 
 similarly, paroxetine (cyp2d6 inhibitor) increases duloxetine overall exposure by 60 %. 
 fluvoxamine, a potent cyp1a2 inhibitor, increases the exposure of duloxetine (more than 5-fold)no 
 significant interactions with benzodiazepines and antacids have been found. the spc clearly reflect 
 these findings. 
 additional data for cyp2c19 was submitted for this application. it is agreed that these isoforms 
 represent a small part of the metabolism of commonly prescribed drug. however, cyp2c8 is an 
 isoenzyme that has recently gained more interest because of</p><p>the occurrence of clinically important 
 interactions due to inhibition of this enzyme, e.g. by gemfibrozil. an 
 in vitro study investigating the effect of duloxetine on the metabolism of a cyp2c8 substrate is to be performed.</p><p>
 • conclusion on human pharmacokinetics duloxetine is a drug with highly variable pharmacokinetics and many factors affect the systemic 
 exposure. from the presented data, gender, age, renal and hepatic function, smoking status, cyp2d6 
 status and drug-drug interactions are all factors affecting the plasma levels of duloxetine. 
 interindividual differences in plasma concentrations of 
 α1-acid glycoprotein (aagp) may also contribute to the variability.</p><p>
 based on the large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and the frequency of adverse events, 
 the most common reason for discontinuation of treatment in clinical studies, the possibility to reduce 
 the dose to 20 mg b.i.d. after 4 weeks in case of troublesome adverse events has been introduced.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics</header><p>six studies were designed to evaluate pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers. four of them were aimed to assess pharmacodynamic effects and safety during treatment with increasing doses of 
 duloxetine and the other two evaluated pharmacodynamic interactions with ethanol and lorazepam.</p><p>
 in addition the results of study sbab assessing the biomechanical effects of 80-mg dose of 
 duloxetine for four weeks versus placebo on bladder and urethral function, was used to elucidate the 
 mechanism of action.</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 15/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 • mechanism of action in vitro, duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of both 5-ht and ne reuptake and a relatively weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. duloxetine has a low affinity for muscarinic acetylcholine, histamine-1, α -1-
 ne, 5-ht
 1a , 5-ht1b, 5ht1d, d2 and opioid receptors. the molecule was active in urinary models indicative of enhancement of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmision with improvement of 
 capacity of the urinary bladder and increased urinary sphincter activity. indirect evidence of similar 
 activity in humans has been obtained. changes in whole-blood 5-ht concentration following chronic 
 administration of 20-mg or larger daily doses of duloxetine suggest that duloxetine interferes with 5-
 ht reuptake in humans. measurement of 48-hour urinary excretion of ne and its metabolites showed 
 that regimens of duloxetine 80 mg once daily or duloxetine 60 mg twice daily were associated with a 
 significant decrease in whole body ne turnover.</p><p>
 study sbab assessed the biomechanical effects of 80-mg dose of duloxetine for four weeks versus 
 placebo on bladder and urethral function. sixty-five (65) women with pure genuine stress incontinence 
 were enrolled in the study. however, only 10 patients on ariclaim and 11 on placebo were possible to 
 evaluate. after four weeks duloxetine-treated patients experienced a significantly greater median 
 percent reduction of ief than placebo patients (57.2% compared with 26.3%, p = .024) . however, the 
 decrease in the absolute number of episodes per week was not statistically significant (mean of 11.8 
 with duloxetine compared with 9.1 with placebo).</p><p> 
 urethral function during the filling phase of the micturition and bladder function and sphincter 
 resistance during emptying phase was measured. although women exhibited a severe urinary 
 incontinence (mean baseline &gt; 21 episodes/week) and pharmacodynamic changes could be expected in 
 a more clear way than in a less severe population, noneof the pre-specified analyses comparing 
 duloxetine with placebo revealed statistically significant differences for any of the five biomechanical 
 measures of urethral function measured in the study.</p><p>post-hoc analysis of valsalva leak-point pressure 
 data and an examination of quantitative striated sphincter electromyographic data in the small number 
 of subjects who completed this study did provide some limited evidence to the view that duloxetine to 
 some degree exerts an effect on the urethra.</p><p>
 the data provided by the study sbab assessing the biomechanical effects of 80-mg dose of 
 duloxetine do not allow valid conclusions regarding its mechanism of action. this is reflected in the 
 spc. the unreliability of the pd data does not necessarily preclude a positive benefit/risk conclusion, 
 but this would mostly depend on pure efficacy and safety data. however, a proper knowledge of the 
 mechanism of action of a drug intended for chronic use and with other potential therapeutic 
 indications is considered relevant. therefore, the applicant is to perform additional studies in order to 
 further elucidate the mechanism of action of duloxetine in patients with sui. this is a relevant issue, 
 mainly due to the novel mechanism of action attributed to duloxetine without any other product of 
 reference available for this condition at present.</p><p>
 • primary and secondary pharmacology in the first human study with duloxetine (study hmaa), a 90% inhibition of ex vivo platelet 
 serotonin uptake was found 2 to 3 hours after the 60-mg doses of up to 60 mg of an immediate-release 
 formulation of duloxetine. 
 in study hmab, 6 subjects received single doses up to 80 mg. inhibition of ex vivo platelet serotonin 
 uptake were found with all doses tested. eight hours after dosing, 10 mg produced 35% to 61% 
 inhibition, 20 mg produced 49% to 75% inhibition, 40 mg produced 64% to 92% inhibition, 60 mg 
 produced 70% to 88% inhibition, and 80 mg produced 84% to 92% inhibition. 
 other studies aimed to demonstrate significant increase in bladder capacity when comparing 
 doloxetine with placebo. increase in urethral closure preassures was also evaluated in the same 
 manner. the different founded however was not statistically significant, an the magnitude of such 
 effects is of uncertain relevance when trying to predict a relevant therapeutic effect.</p><p>
 potential secondary pharmacologic reactions of duloxetine at the clinical dose were noted in the 
 anaesthetised dog model and included increases in pulmonary pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, 
 and respiratory rate. these effects are attributable to the known actions of norepinephrine and

 as other drugs that inhibit monoamine reuptake, duloxetine significantly increases systolic and 
 diastolic blood pressure (less than 2 mmhg) and heart rate (2 to 3 beats per minute). this can be 
 considered as a class effect and no major safety concern seems to derive from this observation. the 
 effects of duloxetine on qt interval have been assessed in about 160 subjects.</p><p>there is no signal 
 indicating that duloxetine might prolong the qt interval regardless of the correction method used.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>the clinical program was developed to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in female patients with sui. one phase ii study (study saaw) and three phase iii studies (studies sbat, sbav and

 exposure to form studies sbau, sbaw and sbbm respectively. study sbay is a stand alone open-

 an overall total of 2850 patients were included in the above referenced program (saaw + sbat + sbav + sbax + sbay) and constitute 
 the efficacy population for this indication. of those, 1913 subjects were randomised to duloxetine 40 mg twice daily or placebo in studies 
 saaw, sbat, sbav, and sbax(958 to duloxetine and 955 to placebo).</p><p>
 a total of 1190 of the placebo controlled studies patients were included in uncontrolled studies (sbau + sbaw + sbbm) and treated with 
 duloxetine.</p><p>
 all clinical studies were performed according to good clinical practice (gcp).</p><p>• dose response study after an initial study failing to show differences between duloxetine (20, 30 and 40 mg), the dose 
 finding data package of this dossier is based on one single placebo controlled trial (study saaw). 
 study saaw was a randomised, parallel, double blind, placebo controlled trial, where 3 doses of 
 duloxetine (20, 40 and 80 mg) were tested. after a 4-week pre-treatment phase that included a 2-week 
 blinded placebo lead-in, patients were given either placebo or one of the 3 dose levels of duloxetine 
 (10 mg bid, 20 mg bid or 40 mg bid). the follow-up period on double blind therapy lasted 12 
 weeks. patients on duloxetine 80 mg were dose escalated over two weeks at the initiation of therapy 
 and also de-escalated over two weeks at the end of the 12-week treatment period. as compared with 
 phase iii pivotal studies, study saaw included a population with a slightly lower incontinence 
 episode frequency (ief) threshold at entry. study saaw excluded subjects over 65 years of age and 
 those with prior continence surgery. 
 the primary efficacy variable was weekly incontinence episode frequency at week 12 based on the 
 itt population, using the locf method. the number of incontinent episodes per 24 hours is a 
 subject-recorded count of the number of incontinent episodes during a 7-day period, obtained from the 
 subject diary. a number of secondary measures were also assessed, including disease-specific tests: 
 cough stress test (cst) and stress pad test (spt), assessment of the severity of the disease: stress 
 incontinence visual analog scale (sivas) and incontinence severity index (isi), and different 
 measures of qol and daily life activities. in addition, the patient global impression-improvement 
 (pgi-i), and the clinical global impression improvement (cgi-i) at weeks 4 and 8, and week 12 
 were also assessed. 
 a responder analysis was also carried out for different variables including the main efficacy endpoint. 
 for this purpose, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least a 50% decrease in ief from 
 baseline to endpoint. 
 all efficacy evaluations were performed according to an intent-to-treat analysis, defined as patients 
 who were randomized to duloxetine or placebo and who had baseline efficacy data and any post-
 baseline efficacy data. questionnaire responses were treated as continuous variables. analysis of 
 variance (anova) models were used to evaluate continuous efficacy variables. the anova model 
 included terms for treatment, site (as a fixed effect), and treatment-by-site interaction. pairwise 
 comparisons were analysed with the least squares means (lsmeans) from the appropriate anova 
 model. categorical variables were analysed using pearson’s chi-square tests. all statistical tests were 
 performed as two-sided, at a .050 significance level except where noted. the analysis of covariance 
 (ancova) models was also used to evaluate efficacy on original and transformed scale.

 emea 2005 in order to assess prospectively the accuracy of history, examination, simple bladder filling and stress pad test for the diagnosis of genuine stress incontinence (gsi), provocative subtracted electronic 
 cystometry (psec) was performed on 90 women at eight sites. this urodynamic test was employed to 
 determine the proportion of subjects in the study population with gsi, as well as identifying a subset 
 of the patients with gsi who have intrinsic sphincteric deficiency (isd). urodynamic traces were 
 centrally read. 
 five hundred fifty three patients were enrolled to provide power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in 
 the ief, assuming a placebo response reduction of 30%. 
 duloxetine at 40 and 80 mg/day doses was superior to placebo in decreasing the ief per week. 
 statistically significant differences were observed for the percent change from baseline to endpoint in 
 ief per week for the duloxetine 40 (adjusted p=.049; unadjusted p=.018) and 80-mg/day (unadjusted 
 p=.045) groups as compared to placebo. the adjusted analysis did not show statistically significant 
 differences between duloxetine 80 mg and placebo (p = .114). duloxetine at 40 and 80 mg/day doses 
 was also superior to placebo in decreasing ief per week when all baseline and post-baseline diaries 
 were pooled. the median percent change from baseline to endpoint in ief per week was 40% for the 
 placebo group, compared with 59% and 58% for the duloxetine 40 and 80 mg/day groups, 
 respectively. an analysis of pgi-i ratings and i-qol questionnaire scores revealed a significant 
 improvement only for the duloxetine 80-mg/day group compared with the placebo group..</p><p>an 
 analysis of data from subjects who completed the 12-week study did not demonstrate statistically 
 significant differences in the percent change from baseline to endpoint for ief per week between the

 (47%). 59% of patients on duloxetine 40 mg were considered as responders (p = .067 vs placebo).</p><p>
 it was considered that, higher plasma concentrations are associated with significantly greater clinical 
 response. analyses of change in i-qol scores also demonstrated a significantly greater improvement 
 when the duloxetine plasma concentrations were higher than the median value (34.8 ng/ml). a 
 significant correlation was observed between css values and the change in the i-qol scores (rho = 
 0.187, p&lt;0.04), indicating that an increase in i-qol scores is observed when duloxetine plasma 
 concentrations are higher. a responder analysis for both ief and i-qol demonstrated that subjects 
 whose c’ss values were above the median were significantly more likely respond to duloxetine 
 therapy in terms of both ief and qol (defining response as a 
 ≥ 50% decrease in ief and an increase in i-qol of at least 30% of the largest possible increase) than those subjects with c’ss value averages 
 below the median. in the applicant’s view, the poppk characteristics of duloxetine support the 
 conclusion that an individual is more likely to maintain a plasma concentration of duloxetine above a 
 specific critical threshold if she takes 80 mg/day than if she takes only 20 or 40 mg/day. further, 
 characteristic values for the half-life (averaging approximately 12 hours) and time to peak 
 concentration (averaging approximately 6 hours) predict that concentrations above this threshold level 
 are more likely to be maintained in the early as well as the late hours of the day when administration is 
 twice daily rather than only once daily.

 emea 2005 the safety profile of duloxetine exhibited in this study is fully consistent with the known safety profile of other agents that inhibit monoamine reuptake. nausea was the most common ae and was 
 experienced by 13% of women at the 80-mg/day dose. twelve of 18 women who experienced nausea 
 at the 80-mg/day dose continued medication despite this adverse event. fatigue, and insomnia were 
 the most clinically relevant dose-dependent aes; however, these events were not considered to have 
 long-term safety consequences. the applicant considered that the safety and tolerability of the 40 and 
 80 mg/day doses are comparable and are not a determining factor for limiting the dose. based on the 
 overall analysis of the safety and efficacy data, the 80 mg/day dose of duloxetine was the selected 
 dose for being further assessed. 
 study saaw enrolled a slightly different population than one supposed to be the real target 
 population. thus, as compared with phase iii pivotal studies, study saaw included patients with a 
 lower incontinence episode frequency (ief) threshold at entry and excluded subjects over 65 years of 
 age. these selection criteria, although should not have a major impact when extrapolating the efficacy 
 results to the intended target population, might have been a relevant conditioning factor for the high 
 placebo response rate observed in this study. the observed placebo response with regard the primary 
 outcome of the study (ief) was about 40%, when the expected reduction rate was 25%. this fact has 
 resulted in a clearly underpowered study, where the p values for the finally selected dose are just 
 neighbouring the statistical significance threshold.</p><p>
 the observed effect of duloxetine (40 and 80 mg) on the ief reduction from baseline is about 60%, 
 which can be considered a modest effect when considering that placebo reduces the ief by 40%. in 
 addition, and despite of this 20% difference in the percentage o reduction of ief, when translating this 
 effect into the median absolute number of sui episodes per week saved for each patient, duloxetine 
 80 mg saves just 1 more episode per day than placebo does (d 80 mg from 7 at baseline to 3 at 
 endpoint vs. pbo from 7 at baseline to 4 at endpoint). this and the effects on i-qol and other 
 subjective outcomes (pgi-i and cgi-i) could be regarded as a marginal effect.</p><p>
 • main studies</p><p>three studies (studies sbat, sbav, and sbax) with identical main protocols are the phase 3 
 studies that form the basis for efficacy of duloxetine. these studies have the same duloxetine dose (40 
 mg twice daily), same duration of double blind treatment (12 weeks), and determined subject 
 eligibility based on the same clinical algorithm. additionally, all three used the same two primary 
 efficacy endpoints and were performed in the target population. 
 the three studies included 1,635 women with signs of sui. they were aimed to assess the efficacy of 
 duloxetine 40 mg twice daily versus placebo in the treatment of women with stress urinary 
 incontinence. all of these studies followed a randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, fixed-dose, 
 double blind, parallel-group design, and 12-week comparison study. in all studies, there was a 4-week 
 baseline period with subjects receiving no study drug for two weeks and placebo for last two weeks. 
 after that, patients were randomised to duloxetine 80 mg/day given as 40 mg twice daily (bid) or 
 placebo for 12-weeks.</p><p>

 emea 2005</p><p>methods</p><p>study participants</p><p>all studies enrolled women, 18 years or older, with a stress urinary incontinence of more than 3 months.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence was defined by a clinical algorithm that included a predominant symptom 
 of sui, with a weekly ief 
 ≥7, absence of predominant symptoms of urge incontinence, normal diurnal and nocturnal frequencies, a bladder capacity of at least 400 ml, and both a positive cough stress test 
 (cst) and stress pad test (spt) at a bladder volume of 400 ml. 
 studies sbat, and sbav had addenda that specified urodynamic testing after randomisation for 
 subjects at some study centres. the primary objective of the addendum was to evaluate the ability of 
 the main study’ s inclusion and exclusion criteria to define a population of subjects with urodynamic 
 (genuine) stress incontinence. this algorithm was 83%, and 100% specific for urodynamic stress 
 incontinence in subsets of subjects in studies sbav, and sbat, respectively, and assured that the 
 majority of women in the trials, in fact, had sui. the individual study reports for those studies, which 
 included urodynamics, document that the algorithm was concordant with urodynamic (genuine) stress 
 incontinence in 83% (study sbav), and 100% (study sbat) of subjects who had urodynamic 
 testing. 
 to prevent potential imbalance at baseline in both treatment assignment and incontinence severity, a 
 stratified randomisation was used. at visit 3, subjects within each site were stratified based on their 
 incontinence episode frequency severity (&lt;14 and 
 ≥14 ief per week). the calculation of severity was made from all the diary records collected after visit 1 and prior to visit 3. 
 patients with significant uncontrolled comorbidity, any condition of the genitourinary tract, recent 
 continence surgery within 6 months), the current use of a continence device, or treatment with an 
 antidepressant, drugs for obesity, or a medication for incontinence were excluded.</p><p>subjects who were 
 on a stable pfmt program for at least 3 months were enrolled as long as they agreed to continue on 
 their pfmt regimen at the same intensity throughout the study.</p><p>treatments duloxetine 80 mg/day, given as 40 mg bid or placebo given bid were administered at fixed doses for 12 weeks (visit 3 to visit 6). subjects were instructed to take their medication twice daily (morning 
 and evening) at consistent times every day.</p><p>outcomes/endpoints primary efficacy parameters</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>incontinence episode frequency per week (ief): the ief was a subject count of the number of 
 incontinence episodes recorded real-time on paper diaries during a 7-day period. 
 the first primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change (as computed by [endpoint – baseline] / 
 baseline) in weekly ief from baseline to endpoint. the diary consisted of seven 24-hour diary 
 records. only those 24-hour diary records that were deemed to be satisfactory were considered in the 
 efficacy analyses. a satisfactory 24-hour diary record was an account of a calendar date on which the 
 subject recorded the date and time of at least three voids. the 24-hour diary record that had entries on 
 the day of a visit was not considered satisfactory because it could not contain information for a full 24-
 hour calendar day. at each visit, a single value was produced for each diary variable by taking the 
 mean of all entries from satisfactory diary records (for example, for ief, mean = total number of 
 incontinence episodes divided by total number of satisfactory diary records) obtained since the 
 previous visit. for ief, seven to obtain incontinence episode frequency per week multiplied this mean. 
 if less than three satisfactory daily 24-hour diary records were collected, the visit value was 
 considered missing. this way of computing and analyzing the diary variables is referred to as “the last 
 7-day diary approach.”</p><p>
 - incontinence quality of life (i-qol): the i-qol is a validated, disease-specific, 22-item, self-
 administered questionnaire allowing subjects to evaluate in their native language the effects and 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 21/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 concerns relating to urinary incontinence. the 22 items in the i-qol can be scored as an overall score or as three domain scores: avoidance and limiting behaviour, social embarrassment, and 
 psychosocial impact. i-qol scores and subscale scores are standardized to a scale from 0 to 100, with 
 100 indicating the best possible condition-specific quality of life. health status and health-related 
 quality of life measures were used in this study to provide detailed information on the impact of 
 urinary incontinence on subjects’ day-to-day lives.</p><p>
 the second primary endpopint was the change in i-qol (as computed by [endpoint – baseline]). 
 changes and percent changes were computed for all randomized subjects with at least one 
 postbaseline and one baseline visit measurement using a last observation carried forward approach.</p><p>
 secondary efficacy parameters 
 - patient global impression of improvement (pgi-i): pgi-i is a validated, single-item treatment 
 outcome questionnaire, measuring a subject’s self-perceived improvement since she started taking the 
 study medication. it is measured on a 7-point scale from “very much better” to “very much worse”. 
 - mean time between voids (mtbv): the mtbv is the average voiding interval derived from the 
 same urinary diaries as defined a priori in the statistical analysis plans for the phase 3 studies.</p><p>sample size the sample size provided approximately 80% (sbat, sbax)-90% (sbav) power for detecting a treatment difference of 20% in the median percent change in ief from baseline to endpoint using a 
 two-sided, .05 level van elteren test. 
 the sample size also provided approximately 94% (sbat, sbax)-98% (sbav) power for detecting 
 a treatment difference of 3.5 points in the mean change in i-qol from baseline to endpoint using a 
 two-sided, .05 level t-test, assuming a standard deviation of 9.9. 
 this calculation assumed that,</p><p>10% or fewer of the randomized subjects would drop out without 
 providing any postbaseline measurement.</p><p>randomisation randomization was controlled by a computerized voice response system at a central location for all study sites. the investigator called the voice response system at each visit in order to receive 
 instructions for distributing study medication and/or diary data collection.</p><p>blinding conventional methods have been used to ascertain blinding of patients and investigators.</p><p>statistical methods the primary time point for all efficacy variables was the last visit after randomization at which the variable was obtained.</p><p>for ief, this was specified “the last 7-day diary analysis” in contrast to a 
 secondary analysis that compared all pre-randomization diaries to all post-randomization diaries, “the 
 pooled diary analysis.” 
 primary statistical analyses were performed according to intent-to-treat (itt) principles and included 
 all subjects with a baseline and a postbaseline measurement. a secondary completer analysis was also 
 performed to assess the impact of early discontinuations due to adverse events on the efficacy profile 
 of duloxetine. if adverse events and clinical benefits were linked, including discontinued subjects in 
 the itt analysis could bias the overall results in favour of duloxetine. therefore, a comparison of itt 
 and completer analyses results for important outcome variables was critical to assess this potential 
 bias.</p><p>
 for the three phase 3 trials, the primary analyses for median percent changes in ief and mean changes 
 in i-qol score compared duloxetine 40 mg twice daily with placebo using with the following two 
 models: 
 - because the normality assumption was not satisfied (shapiro-wilks, �.01), van elteren test (van 
 elteren 1960; a type of stratified wilcoxon test) was used for analysis of percent change in ief 
 between the last prerandomisation and last postrandomisation visit diaries with baseline incontinence 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 22/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 severity strata (&lt;14 and ≥14 ief per week from visit 1 to randomisation visit) as the stratification variables.</p><p>
 - changes in i-qol total scores were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ancova) model. 
 the dependent variables were the change scores, and the model included terms for baseline scores, 
 treatment, baseline incontinence severity strata, and study.</p><p>
 the van elteren test was also used to analyse other ief analyses including absolute change scores and 
 pooled analyses (comparing all prerandomisation to all postrandomisation diaries). ancova was 
 also used to analyse changes in i-qol subscales and mean time between void. treatment differences 
 in pgi-i responses were tested using the cochran-mantel-haenszel statistic. 
 efficacy was also analysed by grouping subjects into responders and nonresponders based on relative 
 improvement from baseline in ief and i-qol. for ief, a responder was defined a priori as a subject 
 who had at least a 50% decrease from baseline to endpoint. an i-qol responder was defined a priori 
 as a subject who improved by at least 30% of the greatest possible improvement in score from baseline 
 to endpoint. the validation of the pgi-i scale with i-qol improvements suggests that the definition is 
 reasonable. in this validation, subjects who rated themselves &quot;a little better&quot; had a 6.4-point increase 
 in their i-qol scores, while those who rated themselves &quot;much better&quot; had a 13.0-point increase. 
 these increases are comparable to the 10.8-point increase that would represent 30% of the maximum 
 possible increase in i-qol score in the overall integrated database

 numbers analysed 
 in study sbax 458 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to duloxetine 80 mg/day (n =227), or placebo (n =231). of this, at 12-weeks, 8.2% (19 patients) discontinued in placebo group and 26% 
 (56 patients) discontinued in the duloxetine group. while no premature discontinuation was due to 
 lack of efficacy, adverse events led to a premature discontinuation in 1.7% of the placebo group and 
 17.2% in the duloxetine group. for the ief analysis, 27 subjects were excluded from the duloxetine 
 group and 2 from the placebo group because they had no postbaseline results. for the i-qol analysis, 
 7 subjects were excluded from the duloxetine group and 2 from the placebo group because they had no 
 postbaseline results.</p><p>outcomes and estimation duloxetine was superior to placebo in decreasing the ief per week (p=. 050) using the last 7-day diary approach.. the median decrease was 53.6% in the duloxetine group and 40.0% in the placebo group. i-
 qol score increases were significantly greater for subjects taking duloxetine than for subjects taking 
 placebo, with mean improvements of 10.34 points in the duloxetine group compared with 6.42 points 
 in the placebo group (p=. 007).</p><p>

 in the combined database, the duloxetine 40 mg twice-daily group showed significantly greater

 significant in patients with a baseline ief &lt;14.</p><p>
 • discussion on clinical efficacy the selection criteria applied in phase iii clinical trials identify patients with sui on the basis of 
 clinical findings (signs and symptoms). a subset of patients underwent urodynamic evaluations 
 indicating that most of enrolled patients were truly suffering from sui. exclusion criteria intend to 
 avoid the inclusion of patients with urge incontinence. 
 patients enrolled in phase iii correspond to a moderate/severe sui population (according to the pgi 
 rating). only 16% of the patients were having concurrent pelvic muscle floor training (pfmt), which 
 is considered the first step in the treatment of sui. however the ever-use and current-use pfmt rates 
 were similar to those reported in the general population, supporting the generalizability of the study 
 populations. 
 design of pivotal studies as parallel double blind against placebo, measurement of efficacy at 12 
 weeks and efficacy parameters are considered appropriated and are, in fact, in agreement with the 
 recommendations made by the chmp note for guidance on the clinical investigation of medicinal 
 products for the treatment of urinary incontinence (chmp/ewp/18/01) 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 28/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 the applicant has selected the percentage reduction from baseline in ief as the primary endpoint, using a quantitative assessment of a disease-specific qol scale as a supportive primary endpoint. as 
 secondary variables, pgi, cgi (among other variables) and an analysis of responders on the basis of 
 pre-defined cut-off points for the different variables have been also provided. this strategy is not 
 entirely in line with the chmp note for guidance, suggesting that main therapeutic trials should focus 
 the use of measurements of subjective improvement, as the pgi or the cgi. however, and provided 
 that consistency in the drug effect on these variables is proven, the applicant approach was considered 
 acceptable when taking on board that the mentioned chmp note for guidance came into operation on 
 december 2002 and the present dossier was filed on november 2002.</p><p>overall, although not statistically significant in all trials, duloxetine has shown a consistently greater 
 effect on ief and qol than placebo. the magnitude of the relative effect on ief is about a 50% 
 reduction with considerable placebo response ranging from 27% to 40%. however, and as already 
 highlighted for the dose-finding study, the absolute median reduction in incontinence episode 
 frequency per week was only 1.5, 3.0, and 3.9 for the phase 3 trials compared with placebo. the 
 clinical relevance of such magnitude can be questioned. i-qol assessment as well as the pgi and the 
 cgi show a consistent effect of duloxetine over placebo.</p><p>
 only 16% of patients were receiving pfmt during the study and no information is provided on the 
 quality of and compliance with it. pfmt is considered the first therapeutic approach for women with 
 sui. published data indicate that this non-pharmacological approach can improve symptoms in around 
 half of patients. in this regard, the clinical development program does not reveal whether duloxetine 
 therapy provides any additional effect to an adequately standardised pfmt. 
 study sbaf provides additional information about the role of duloxetine in the moderate-severe sui 
 therapeutic program where pfmt is considered a first stage step. the primary objective of this study 
 was to compare combined therapy (duloxetine + pfmt) versus no treatment (placebo + imitation 
 pfmt) and to compare combined therapy versus pfmt. combined therapy showed the greatest ief 
 reduction than each monotherapy (duloxetine or pfmt) or placebo. duloxetine alone showed greater 
 reduction than pfmt. thus, in the assessors’ view, study sbaf would support use of the combined 
 treatment. it could be questioned, however, if the study period of 3 months was long enough to allow 
 the maximum effect of pfmt to be demonstrated. the results would therefore support a 
 recommendation to use the combined treatment. this is reflected in the spc. 
 in this type of disease, the clinical relevance of the observed improvement assessed by mean of 
 quantitative (continuous or discrete) variables is of difficult interpretation, and a responder analysis in 
 a prospectively defined way is considered of paramount importance. upon request, an analysis of the 
 number of &quot;dry&quot; days during treatment in relation to pre-treatment was made to contribute to the 
 interpretation of clinical effects. 
 when patients were analysed according their incontinence severity at baseline (&lt; 14 ief/week and 
 ≥ 14 ief/week) the improvement was less pronounced for the less severe strata of patients without a clear translation into a quality of life benefit. a new analysis of the previously submitted efficacy data 
 was provided according to the number of dry days (from 7 to 0) at the end of the study. cure rates (i.e. 
 dry 7 days) are really scarce for both stratum (more severe: duloxetine 5.4%, placebo 2.9%; less 
 severe: duloxetine 15.7%, placebo: 12.5%). for the less severe subjects differences between 
 duloxetine and placebo treated patients hardly achieved 6% across the complete distribution of dry 
 days. thus, the clinical meaningfulness of duloxetine in women with less severe sui is still 
 questionable.</p><p>
 when a new definition (post-hoc) of cure or improvement was applied (4 or more dry days/week) 
 58.6% of patients on duloxetine and 52.5% on placebo responded (p=.09; chi-square) within the less 
 severe stratum. among patients with more than 14 episodes per week the response rate on the basis of 
 the same variable was 27% for duloxetine and 14.7% for placebo.</p><p>
 although previous surgery, in a pooled data analysis, did not appear to have an impact on duloxetine 
 efficacy with regard to reduction of ief, the weight of this analysis is considered limited, and this is 
 reflected in the spc. 
 study sbba compared the of duloxetine80 mg/day with placebo on quality of life in a naturalistic 
 protocol resembling general conditions of clinical practice. the study failed to show any positive 
 effect of duloxetine over placebo on quality of life. no information regarding the number of 
 incontinence episodes at baseline has been provided nor on the reduction in ief achieved at the end of 
 the treatment. however, less restrictive inclusion criteria considered for this study (
 ≥ 1 incontinence medicinal product no longer authorised 29/35</p><p>
 emea 2005 episode per week) would allow recruiting a population close to the less severe end of the disease. those negative results seem to confirm the negligible effect of duloxetine in mild sui patients.</p><p>on the other hand, when severely affected patients are enrolled (study sbam) significantly greater 
 reduction in ief was achieved in duloxetine treated patients compared with those in placebo group. 
 this was also reflected in i-qol improvement. the spc, therefore, clearly reflects the limited 
 usefulness of duloxetine in patients with mild sui.</p><p>
 it is important to assess the efficacy beyond 3 months. the negative results of the study sbba, which 
 failed to show positive effect of duloxetine over placebo over a treatment period of 36 weeks in an 
 ordinary clinical setting, throws serious doubts as to the clinical meaningfulness of the product in 
 general long-term use. thus, the long-term (&gt;3 months) results still remain weak and, considering that 
 sui is a sustained problem for the majority of women, the lack of documented long-term effects is 
 reflected in the spc.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>the integrated safety data were classified into three databases based on duloxetine dosage and treatment indications.</p><p>
 the primary safety database includes data on duloxetine- and placebo-treated women from all 
 completed double blind sui studies in which subjects were randomly assigned to a dose of 40 mg 
 twice daily throughout the trial. the three phase 3 randomised clinical trials (studies sbat, sbav, 
 and sbax), one phase 2 randomised clinical trial (study saaw), the three open-label extensions to 
 the three phase 3 trials (studies sbau, sbaw, and sbbm), and one stand-alone open-label safety 
 study (study sbay) comprise the primary safety database. 
 the secondary safety database includes data from all subjects (women and men) from all completed 
 double-blind depression and pain studies in which subjects were randomly assigned to a dose of at 
 least 40 mg twice-daily duloxetine or to placebo. also included are data from the final locked database 
 of the long-term, open-label depression study. 
 the tertiary safety database consists of data from clinical pharmacology studies, all completed urinary 
 incontinence and depression studies in which subjects were randomised to a dose of less than 
 duloxetine 40 mg twice daily or placebo, japanese studies, and all ongoing duloxetine studies except 
 those in the primary safety database. 
 safety data (adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests) were monitored throughout the 
 studies. adverse events were elicited by open-ended, nondirected questioning of the subject, clinical 
 observation, and source document review. the adverse events terms initially recorded by site 
 personnel were mapped to medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra) terms. the study 
 site investigator based on his or her clinical judgement assigned causality for saes and deaths.</p><p> 
 • patient exposure a total of 4127 duloxetine subjects, representing approximately 1842 subject-years of exposure to 
 duloxetine, were included in the primary and secondary safety databases up to the data cut-off date of 
 14 june 2002.</p><p>
 there were 2301 subjects in the primary safety database ranging from 20 to 87 years of age; all were 
 women, and 93% were caucasian. they had approximately 956 subject-years of exposure, with 190 of 
 those subject-years of exposure occurring in the placebo-controlled trials in patients with sui (958 
 duloxetine-treated and 955 placebo-treated patients). of all the subjects in the primary safety database, 
 818 had more than 6 months of exposure to duloxetine, and 191 had more than 12 months of exposure.</p><p> 
 • adverse events</p><p>treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes) from double-blind trials in the primary safety database 
 for which the incidence in the duloxetine treatment group was ≥5.0% and significantly greater than the 
 incidence in the placebo group were nausea (23.2% vs 3.7%), dry mouth (13.4% vs 1.5%), fatigue 
 (12.7% vs 3.8%), insomnia (12.6% vs 1.9%), constipation (11.0% vs 2.3), headache (9.7% vs 6.6%), 
 dizziness (excluding vertigo) (9.5% vs 2.6%), somnolence (6.8% vs 0.1%), and diarrhoea (5.1% vs

 the most common adverse events, except diarrhoea, typically began within the first month of 
 treatment, many within the first 2 days. most common adverse events resolved in the majority of

 • serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events one death (a 70-year-old caucasian woman, previously diagnosed of hypertension and 
 hypercholesterolemia who had been taking duloxetine for 52 days and suffered a multifocal embolic 
 cerebrovascular accident resulting in coma and death) was reported from the primary safety database. 
 this event was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. after the database cut-off date 
 of 14 june 2002, a second death occurred in this primary safety database. a 59-year-old woman 
 assigned to duloxetine, died from a pulmonary oat cell metastatic carcinoma. in the opinion of the 
 investigator, it is unlikely it were related to study drug. an autopsy for this subject is pending and 
 further information has been requested. 
 two deaths were reported for the controlled studies in the secondary safety database (1 duloxetine, 1 
 placebo): a 77-year-old caucasian man randomised to duloxetine 40 mg twice daily, who experienced 
 a cardiopulmonary arrest that resulted in death 4 days after his last dose of duloxetine and was 
 considered not related, and a 73-year-old caucasian man randomised to placebo treatment who 
 experienced an accidental drowning resulting in death. six deaths (4 duloxetine, 1 placebo, 1 blinded 
 treatment) were reported in the tertiary safety database before or after data cut-off date, none of them 
 being attributable to study drug or procedures.</p><p>
 when both double blind and open-label studies in the primary safety database were reviewed, 70 
 subjects (3.2%) had reported a total of 105 saes. the majority of sae in the duloxetine-treated group 
 were not attributed to the study drug by the investigators who were blinded. 
 the incidence of saes that may be related to duloxetine was low. the incidence of saes did not 
 differ significantly from placebo. 
 a recently reported sar of a completed suicide in a healthy female volunteer without sui on placebo 
 after being tapered from a high dose of duloxetine reinforces the need for a detailed description of 
 suicides occurring during the clinical development of duloxetine and during its post-marketing 
 experience outside the eu. the risk of discontinuation symptoms are clearly stated in the spc 
 another case of suicide attempt in a 43 year-old female patient in an open label phase iii study was 
 reported during the decision-making phase. the view of the committee was that ariclaim is expected 
 to be prescribed and used by physicians and patients that might be not fully informed of the potential 
 association between antidepressant drugs and suicidal behaviour. 
 as a consequence, the chmp considered that the spc and the pl for all medicinal products 
 containing duloxetine should include information, warning prescribers and patients of this potential 
 risk. this warning was considered especially important for ariclaim, as it is expected to be used in a 
 population, which might be unaware of this problem. 
 appropriate warning information has been included in the spc and pl. additionally, a post-marketing 
 surveillance program for all medicinal products containing duloxetine will be carried out.</p><p>

 emea 2005 • laboratory findings numerically small but significant increases were observed in the mean values for aspartate 
 transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphotase in the duloxetine-treated group 
 compared with the placebo group. significantly more duloxetine-treated subjects had elevations of 
 alt and ast above the covance reference range than placebo-treated subjects. no significant 
 difference was observed between duloxetine- and placebo-treated subjects in the incidence of hepatic 
 enzyme elevations ≥3 times and ≥10 times the upper limit of normal using the covance reference 
 ranges. no case of previously defined as severe hepatic injury was reported in duloxetine treated 
 subjects.</p><p>
 a mean increase of 5.8 u/l in cpk was observed for duloxetine-treated subjects, compared with 0.1 
 u/l for the subjects assigned to placebo. elevated cpk levels were observed at any time after 
 randomisation in 28 duloxetine-treated compared with 27 placebo-treated subjects. a single subject 
 with baseline cpk level within the normal range had a cpk elevation of 4430 u/l 98 days after 
 starting duloxetine. the cpk level drawn one month later was 98. 
 the blood preassure (bp) increases with duloxetine were small though consistent across all studies in 
 the primary and secondary databases and averaged &lt;2 mmhg. there was no significant difference in 
 the incidence of sustained hypertension (sustained increases of either systolic or diastolic pressures) 
 between the duloxetine-treated (0.2%) and placebo-treated (0.7%) groups in the placebo-controlled 
 trials. the mean increases in systolic and diastolic bps observed for subjects with pre-existing 
 hypertension assigned to duloxetine were smaller than those observed for subjects assigned to placebo. 
 effects of duloxetine on ecg parameters were assessed. clinical pharmacological studies involving a 
 total of approximately 160 subjects who had received a single 60-mg dose, showed a shorter qtc 
 intervals and a small (4 msec) decrease in the pr interval. 
 overall, the qt interval corrected for heart rate (qtc) analysis revealed no arrhythmogenic tendencies 
 with duloxetine. a statistically significant increase in heart rate accompanied by the expected decrease 
 in both pr and rr intervals was observed with duloxetine, consistent with its clinically mild 
 peripheral noradrenergic pharmacologic action. (in both primary controlled and uncontrolled studies)</p><p>
 • safety in special populations safety data were analysed according to subgroups based on age, race, and pre-existing hypertension. 
 there were no clinically relevant interactions in the incidence of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
 values, or in vital signs observed for duloxetine treatment for the age or race subgroups. significantly 
 more esrd subjects reported adverse events occurring on or after the only dose of the study drug (8 
 esrd subjects reported 17 adverse events), compared with healthy subjects (1 subject reported five 
 adverse events). subjects with cirrhosis child pugh class b experienced more adverse events although 
 there were no serious events in any subject. each of the 6 cirrhotic subjects reported a total of 35 
 adverse events (25 possible or probably related) versus no adverse events reported in seven healthy 
 subjects. nineteen pregnancies exposed to duloxetine at various doses were reported from all three-
 safety databases. all exposures were in the first trimester. eleven had pregnancies that delivered in the 
 third trimester, of whom 9 delivered apparently normal babies at term, and 2 delivered after premature 
 rupture of membranes and/or preterm labour, with neither infant surviving.</p><p>
 • safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions in the double-blind studies in the primary safety database, 86.5% of subjects (duloxetine 86.0%, 
 placebo 86.9%) used one or more of approximately 1140 concomitant medications. of these, four 
 (ibuprofen, paracetamol, conjugated estrogens, and a multivitamin) were used by 10.3% to 12.2% of 
 subjects. an additional seven (acetylsalicylic acid, various thyroid and reproductive hormones, various 
 vitamins, and calcium) were used by 5% to 10% of subjects. of the unique medications consumed, 
 99% did fewer than 30 subjects assigned to duloxetine, and over 96% each use each fewer than 15 
 subjects assigned to duloxetine used. no analysis of the relationship between concomitant medications 
 and adverse events with duloxetine was performed due to the large number of medications and the 
 small size of the subgroups. 
 for all of the individual cases of serious adverse events occurring during the duloxetine clinical trials, 
 the responsible investigator assessed the possible causal relationship of concomitant medications 
 administered to the specific subject.</p><p>

 emea 2005 women using medications in several classes (antidepressants, stimulant drugs used in the treatment of obesity, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [maois], and other incontinence drugs) were excluded from 
 participating in the stress incontinence clinical trials.</p><p>
 • discontinuation due to adverse events in the controlled studies (primary safety database), the overall incidence of discontinuation due to 
 adverse events was significantly greater for the duloxetine group (196; 20.5%) compared with the 
 placebo group (37; 3.9%). specific adverse events for which the discontinuation rate in duloxetine-
 treated subjects was ≥ 1.0% and twice the rate of placebo-treated subjects were nausea, dizziness 
 (excluding vertigo), insomnia, fatigue, and somnolence. all were significantly more common in 
 duloxetine-treated subjects as well as anxiety (duloxetine 0.6% vs placebo 0%). when long-term 
 open-label extension studies were included, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to duloxetine-
 associated adverse events was 30.6%. the majority of discontinuations (87%) occurred in the first 4 
 weeks of duloxetine treatment. the overall incidence of discontinuation due to duloxetine-associated 
 adverse events was 30.6% in the primary safety database (including the four open-label extension 
 studies) up to the database cutoff date of 14 june 2002.</p><p>
 • discontinuation symptoms discontinuation symptoms seen after duloxetine treatment (secondary safety database) reported with a 
 significantly greater frequency by duloxetine-treated subjects included dizziness (excluding vertigo), 
 headache knows, nausea, paraesthesia, abnormal dreams, nightmare, irritability, somnolence, 
 increased appetite nos, and tension. the risk of discontinuation symptoms is clearly stated in the 
 spc.</p><p>
 • post marketing experience duloxetine has not been approved for marketing in any country at this time.</p><p>
 • discussion on clinical safety the safety database from short-term trials (12 weeks) is extensive (958 exposed patients) and well 
 reported. data on long-term exposure have been less extensively reported as they emanate from 
 ongoing studies. 191 patients have been exposed for 12 months in sui studies. in addition data from 
 the secondary safety database including studies for other indications than sui have been presented. 
 forty various aes occurred significantly more often in the duloxetine group than in the placebo group 
 in the pooled 12-week studies. the most common aes were nausea (23%), dry mouth (13%), fatigue 
 (13%), insomnia (13%), and constipation (11%). headache, dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhoea 
 occurred in 5-10% of the duloxetine patients. another 16 aes, including vomiting, anorectic 
 disturbances, libido disturbances, sleep disorders, lethargy, and weakness occurred in 1-5% of the 
 duloxetine patients. 
 the majority of aes was mild to moderate and resolved within 30 days of treatment. still, in many 
 patients the most common aes (dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia and constipation) remained for more 
 than 30 days. among patients reporting dizziness, nausea, insomnia and somnolence, between 12 and 
 22% discontinued treatment. among the most commonly reported aes, 10-15% were reported as 
 severe. 
 in total, 20.5% of duloxetine patients discontinued treatment for aes vs. 3.9% in the placebo group in 
 the four pivotal 12-week studies. including data from the ongoing open continuation studies, 30.6% of 
 the patients had discontinued treatment at the database cut-off date. 
 no deaths that were judged as related to treatment were reported and the number of saes was low 
 with little or no association to treatment. two cases with severe liver disturbances were reported. 
 although, in both cases other predisposing factors were present and the role of duloxetine was judged 
 as uncertain, an association could not be excluded. 
 among laboratory results the only finding that may be of clinical significance was an increase in 
 transaminases above placebo in duloxetine treated patients and also a higher number of patients with 
 abnormal values. no effects on vital signs of clinical importance were observed. analysis of ecgs 
 from all patients in the pivotal sui studies did not reveal any arrythmogenic tendencies with 
 duloxetine

 emea 2005 unsurprisingly, long term exposure show a higher incidence of discontinuation (30.6% versus 20.5%) and of saes (3.2% versus 1.9%) compared to short-term treatment. apart from that, the safety profile 
 can be considered similar to that already known. 
 during the phase 3 clinical development of duloxetine in sui patient’s withdrawal symptoms were 
 not specifically considered and only one phase 2 study looked at a tapering phase at the end of the 
 treatment.</p><p> based on the pattern of discontinuation symptoms from studies of duloxetine for all 
 indications, the spc specifies dose tapering at the time of discontinuation to minimize the risk of 
 symptoms. 
 as with other drugs with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases of suicidal 
 ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment 
 discontinuation. adequate warning information of the potential association of suicidal ideation and 
 behaviour with the use of duloxetine, has been included in the product information.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
  
 quality</header><p>the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the spc. physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
 performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.</p></section><section><header>non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>overall the pharmacodynamic studies showed that that duloxetine induced inhibition of 5-ht and ne reuptake. this inhibition suppressed urinary bladder muscular activity in a dose-dependent manner, 
 and enhanced external urethral sphincter activity through centrally mediated (cns) mechanism. 
 duloxetine was active in urinary models, indicative of enhancement of serotonin and norepinephrine 
 neurotransmission, with improvement of capacity of the urinary bladder and increased urinary 
 sphincter activity 
 the general pharmacology studies are appropriate to support the non-clicical-pharmacology profile of 
 duloxetine. 
 from the pharmacokinetic point of view, mice, rats, and dogs were the most relevant species for non-
 clinical efficacy and safety studies. the non-clinical pharmacokinetics properties for duloxetine have 
 been appropriately described. a number of studies concerning the absorption, distribution, 
 metabolism, and excretion of duloxetine in mice, rats, and dogs have been performed. duloxetine is 
 well absorbed in all studied species, and is extensively metabolised, especially at the liver. 
 overall, the toxicology programme revealed the liver as the target organ related to duloxetine 
 administration in all species tested. 
 the dog was chosen as the non-rodent species for use in the toxicology programme.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>the efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of sui was established in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with sui; of 
 these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. the primary efficacy measures 
 were incontinence episode frequency (ief) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life 
 questionnaire score (i-qol). 
 overall, although not statistically significant in all trials, duloxetine has shown a consistently greater 
 effect on ief and qol than placebo. the magnitude of the relative effect on ief is about 50% with a 
 placebo response ranging from 27% to 40%. when patients were analysed according their 
 incontinence severity at baseline (&lt; 14 ief/week and 
 ≥ 14 ief/week) the improvement was less pronounced for the less severe stratum of patients without a clear translation into a quality of life 
 benefit. hence the indication has been restricted to moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence.</p><p>
 the lack of documented long-term effects is also reflected in the spc.</p><p>medicinal product no longer authorised 35/35</p><p>
 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>the primary safety database from short-term trials (12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with sui) included 958 duloxetine-treated patients and 955 placebo-treated patients. this 
 represents 190 patient-years of exposure at 40 mg twice daily. data on long-term exposure have been 
 less extensively reported as they emanate from ongoing studies.</p><p>
 duloxetine is a drug with highly variable pharmacokinetics and many factors affect the systemic 
 exposure (gender, age, renal and hepatic function, smoking status, cyp2d6 status, drug-drug 
 interactions) 
 aes occurred significantly more often in the duloxetine group than in the placebo group in the pooled 
 12-week studies. the most common aes were nausea (23%), dry mouth (13%), fatigue (13%), 
 insomnia (13%), and constipation (11%). headache, dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhoea occurred in 
 5-10% of the duloxetine patients. others aes, including vomiting, anorectic disturbances, libido 
 disturbances, sleep disorders, lethargy, and weakness occurred in 1-5% of the duloxetine patients. 
 the majority of aes was mild to moderate and resolved within 30 days of treatment 
 in total, 20.5% of duloxetine patients discontinued treatment for aes vs. 3.9% in the placebo group in 
 the four pivotal 12-week studies.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>stress urinary incontinence is a common and chronic condition in women. while not life-threatening, it can have a significant negative impact on the psychological well-being, social functioning and 
 overall quality of life of those it affect. at present there is no approved pharmacological treatment for 
 this condition.</p><p>
 duloxetine has shown an effect in patients with stress urinary incontinence in terms of both frequency 
 of incontinence episodes and subjective measures as quality of life, patient global impression and 
 clinical global impression. data provided by the applicant indicate that, although modest, the 
 observed effect is clinically meaningful in patients with moderate to severe stress urinary 
 incontinence, especially when the drug is combined with pelvic floor muscle training. although the 
 long-term safety database is limited, the tolerability profile of duloxetine seems acceptable. therefore, 
 and considering that no pharmacological alternative is available for the treatment of stress urinary 
 incontinence, duloxetine might play a role in alleviating the symptoms of such an uncomfortable 
 clinical condition. a positive benefit/risk can be concluded.</p></section><section><header>recommendation</header><p>based on the chmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the chmp considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of duloxetine in the treatment of women with moderate to sever
