 posology and method of administration</header><p>stress urinary incontinence: the recommended dose of ariclaim is 40 mg twice daily without regard to meals. after 2-4 weeks of treatment, patients should be re-assessed in order to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the 
 therapy. some patients may benefit from starting treatment at a dose of 20 mg twice daily for two 
 weeks before increasing to the recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily.</p><p>dose escalation may 
 decrease, though not eliminate, the risk of nausea and dizziness. 
 however, limited data are available to support the efficacy of ariclaim 20 mg twice daily. 
 a 20 mg capsule is also available.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
 studies. the benefit of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals.</p><p>
 combining ariclaim with a pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt) program may be more effective 
 than either treatment alone. it is recommended that consideration be given to concomitant pfmt.</p><p>diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: the starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, 
 have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.</p><p>the plasma concentration of 
 duloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2). hence, some patients that respond 
 insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose.</p><p>
 the medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment. additional response 
 after this time is unlikely (see 5.1).</p><p>
 the therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.</p><p>
 3 hepatic insufficiency: ariclaim should not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 renal insufficiency: no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min). ariclaim should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment 
 (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min; see section 4.3).</p><p>
 elderly no dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. caution should be exercised when treating the elderly</p><p>
 children and adolescents: there is no experience in children (see section 4.4). discontinuation of treatment: abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. when stopping treatment with ariclaim the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of 
 withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). if intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in 
 the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be 
 considered. subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 ariclaim should not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase 
 inhibitors - maois (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 ariclaim should not be used in combination with cyp1a2 inhibitors, like fluvoxamine, 
 ciprofloxacin or enoxacine since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of 
 duloxetine (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the initiation of treatment with ariclaim is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled 
 hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 
 4.8).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>mania and seizures ariclaim should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures.</p><p>
 use with antidepressants the use of ariclaim in combination with antidepressants (especially with ssri, snri and reversible maois) is not recommended (see below “depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour” and 
 section 4.5).</p><p>st john’s wort undesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of ariclaim and herbal preparations containing st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum). 
 4</p><p>mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-
 angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 blood pressure and heart rate duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients. this may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. cases of 
 hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing 
 hypertension. therefore,in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood 
 pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. duloxetine 
 should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart 
 rate or by an increase in blood pressure. caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used 
 with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). for patients who experience 
 a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual 
 discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). in patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
 duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). for patients with severe renal impairment, see 
 section 4.3. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.</p><p>haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and serotonin/norepinephrine 
 reuptake inhibitors (snris). caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal 
 products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.</p><p>
 discontinuation of treatment withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8). in a clinical trial adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation 
 occurred in approximately 44% of patients treated with ariclaim and 24% of patients taking 
 placebo.</p><p>
 the risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with ssri’s and snri’s may be dependent on several factors 
 including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. the most commonly 
 reported reactions are listed in section 4.8. generally the symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe in intensity.</p><p>they usually occur within the first few days of 
 discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have 
 inadvertently missed a dose. generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 
 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).</p><p>it is therefore 
 advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no 
 less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 hyponatremia hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering ariclaim. caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatremia; such as elderly, 
 cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. hyponatremia may be due to a 
 syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (siadh).</p><p>depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. depression is associated with an increased 
 risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). this risk persists until 
 significant remission occurs. as improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of 
 treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. it is general clinical 
 5 experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. patients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to 
 commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal 
 behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. a meta-analysis of placebo-
 controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an 
 increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 
 years old 
 cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or 
 early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). physicians should encourage patients to report 
 any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim 
 therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be 
 sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. if a decision to initiate antidepressant 
 pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of ariclaim is recommended (see 
 section 4.2).</p><p>use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. long-term safety 
 data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural 
 development are lacking.</p><p>medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). the use of more than one of 
 these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p><p>hepatitis/increased liver enzymes cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). most of them occurred 
 during the first months of treatment. the pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.</p><p>duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated 
 with hepatic injury.</p><p>
 akathisia/psychomotor restlessness the use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability 
 to sit or stand still. this is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. in patients who 
 develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.</p><p>
 sucrose ariclaim gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, ariclaim should 
 not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. caution is advisable if 
 6 ariclaim is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum),</p><p>venlafaxine or triptans, 
 tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.</p><p>
 cns medicinal products: caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products 
 (benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>
 effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products medicinal products metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).</p><p>
 medicinal products metabolised by cyp2d6: duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6. when duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a 
 cyp2d6 substrate, the auc of desipramine increased 3-fold. the co-administration of duloxetine (40 
 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not 
 affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is 
 recommended. caution is advised if ariclaim is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
 predominantly metabolised by cyp2d6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas] such as 
 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such 
 as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding. 
 furthermore, increases in inr values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
 warfarin.</p><p>
 effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists
 : co-administration of ariclaim with aluminium- and magnesium-
 containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine 
 absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of ariclaim with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of 
 duloxetine. fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent 
 plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 0-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see 
 section 4.3).</p><p>
 inducers of cyp1a2: population pharmacokinetic studies analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3). the potential risk for humans is unknown. withdrawal symptoms 
 may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. ariclaim is contraindicated 
 during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 breast feeding duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did</p><p>not breast feed their children . the estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately 
 7 0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). as the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of ariclaim while breast-feeding is not recommended.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p> no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. ariclaim may be associated with sedation and dizziness. patients should be instructed that if they experience 
 sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating 
 machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8

 discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
 dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and 
 intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, 
 hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. 
 generally, for ssris and snris, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. it is therefore advised that when duloxetine 
 treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 electrocardiograms were obtained from 755 duloxetine-treated patients with sui and 779 placebo-

 group.</p><p>
 13 electrocardiograms were obtained from 528 duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathic pain in clinical trials lasting up to 13-weeks. the heart rate-corrected qt interval 
 in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients. no clinically 
 significant differences were observed for qt, pr, qrs, or qtcb measurements between duloxetine-
 treated and placebo-treated patients.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there is limited clinical experience with duloxetine overdose in humans. cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 4800mg were reported. some 
 fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with duloxetine alone at a dose of 
 approximately 1000 mg. signs and symptoms of overdose (mostly with mixed medicinal products) 
 included serotonin syndrome, somnolence, vomiting and seizures.</p><p>
 no specific antidote for duloxetine is known but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment 
 (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered.. a free airway should be 
 established. monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate 
 symptomatic and supportive measures. gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after 
 ingestion or in symptomatic patients. activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. 
 duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange 
 perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antidepressants.</p><p>atc code: n06ax21</p><p>
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors.</p><p>
 in animal studies, increased levels of 5-ht and ne in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral 
 tone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the 
 storage phase of the micturition cycle. a similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger 
 urethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine 
 in the treatment of women with sui.</p><p>
 duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory 
 pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. the pain inhibitory action of 
 duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the 
 central nervous system.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence: the efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of 
 sui was established in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women 
 (22 to 83 years) with sui; of these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. 
 the primary efficacy measures were incontinence episode frequency (ief) from diaries and an 
 incontinence specific quality of life questionnaire score (i-qol).</p><p>
 incontinence episode frequency: in all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater median decrease in ief compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. differences were observed 
 at each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54%, and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks 
 (52% and 33%) of medication.</p><p>
 in an additional study limited to patients with severe sui, all responses with duloxetine were achieved 
 within 2 weeks.</p><p>
 14</p><p>the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled studies. the clinical benefit of ariclaim compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in 
 women with mild sui, defined in randomised trials as those with ief &lt; 14 per week.</p><p>in these women, 
 ariclaim may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural 
 interventions.</p><p>
 quality of life: incontinence quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire scores were significantly improved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the</p><p>placebo-treated group (9.2 versus 
 5.9 score improvement, p&lt;.001). using a global improvement scale (pgi), significantly more women 
 using duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment 
 compared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p&lt;.001).</p><p>
 ariclaim and prior continence surgery: there are limited data that suggest that the benefits of ariclaim are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously 
 undergone continence surgery.</p><p>ariclaim and pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt): during a 12-week blinded, randomised, controlled study, ariclaim demonstrated greater reductions in ief compared with either placebo 
 treatment or with pfmt alone.</p><p>combined therapy (duloxetine + pfmt) showed greater improvement 
 in both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than ariclaim alone or pfmt alone.</p><p>diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: the efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) 
 having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.</p><p>patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major 
 depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.</p><p>the primary outcome measure was the weekly 
 mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point likert 
 scale.</p><p>
 in both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
 compared with placebo. the effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. the 
 difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.</p><p>at least 
 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 
 40% for placebo. the corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% 
 respectively. clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to 
 whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. for patients not experiencing 
 somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients 
 on placebo.</p><p>clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 
 30% on placebo. patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
 unlikely to reach this level during further treatment.</p><p>
 although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, no 
 conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from placebo-
 controlled studies.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a c
 max occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%; n=8 subjects). 
 15 food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).</p><p>
 duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin 
 and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both 
 cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 
 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to cyp2d6 has not 
 been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in 
 these patients.</p><p>
 the elimination half-life of duloxetine after an oral dose ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). 
 after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 
 36 l/hr) after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr 
 (mean 101 l/hr).</p></section><section><header>special populations:</header><p>gender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance is approximatively 50% lower in females). based upon the overlap in the range of 
 clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a 
 lower dose for female patients.</p><p>age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. as a general 
 recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had a 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared to healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic insufficiency: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>
 nursing mothers: the disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum. duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast 
 milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. the amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 
 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.</p><p>multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat 
 carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.</p><p>
 female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas 
 and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
 hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. the relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
 female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in 
 maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices 
 and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at 
 16 the most at maximum clinical exposure (auc). in an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels 
 below the maximun clinical exposure (auc). no malformations were observed in another study 
 testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. in pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, 
 duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposures levels below

 posology and method of administration</header><p>stress urinary incontinence: the recommended dose of ariclaim is 40 mg twice daily without regard to meals. after 2-4 weeks of treatment, patients should be re-assessed in order to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the 
 therapy. some patients may benefit from starting treatment at a dose of 20 mg twice daily for two 
 weeks before increasing to the recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily.</p><p>dose escalation may 
 decrease, though not eliminate, the risk of nausea and dizziness. 
 however, limited data are available to support the efficacy of ariclaim 20 mg twice daily.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
 studies. the benefit of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals.</p><p>
 combining ariclaim with a pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt) program may be more effective 
 than either treatment alone. it is recommended that consideration be given to concomitant pfmt.</p><p>diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: the starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, 
 have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.</p><p>the plasma concentration of 
 duloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2). hence, some patients that respond 
 insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose.</p><p>
 the medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment. additional response 
 after this time is unlikely (see 5.1).</p><p>
 the therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.</p><p>
 19 hepatic insufficiency: ariclaim should not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 renal insufficiency: no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min). ariclaim should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment 
 (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min; see section 4.3).</p><p>
 elderly: no dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. caution should be exercised when treating the elderly.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: there is no experience in children (see section 4.4). discontinuation of treatment: abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. when stopping treatment with ariclaim the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of 
 withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). if intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in 
 the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be 
 considered. subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual 
 rate.).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 section 4.5).</p><p>20 st john’s wort undesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of ariclaim and herbal preparations containing st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum).</p><p>mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-
 angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 blood pressure and heart rate duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients. this may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. cases of 
 hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing 
 hypertension. therefore,in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood 
 pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. duloxetine 
 should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart 
 rate or by an increase in blood pressure. caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used 
 with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). for patients who experience 
 a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual 
 discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). in patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
 duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). for patients with severe renal impairment, see 
 section 4.3. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.</p><p>
 haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and serotonin/norepinephrine 
 reuptake inhibitors (snris). caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal 
 products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.</p><p>
 discontinuation of treatment withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8). in a clinical trial, adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation 
 occurred in approximately 44%</p><p>of patients treated with ariclaim and 24% of patients taking 
 placebo. 
 the risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with ssri’s and snri’s may be dependent on several factors 
 including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. the most commonly 
 reported reactions are listed in section 4.8. generally the symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe in intensity.</p><p>they usually occur within the first few days of 
 discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have 
 inadvertently missed a dose. generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 
 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).</p><p>it is therefore 
 advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no 
 less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 hyponatremia hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering ariclaim. caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatremia; such as elderly, 
 cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. hyponatremia may be due to a 
 syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (siadh).</p><p>depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. depression is associated with an increased 
 risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). this risk persists until 
 21 significant remission occurs. as improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. it is general clinical 
 experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. patients with a history 
 of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to 
 commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal 
 behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. a meta-analysis of placebo-
 controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an 
 increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 
 years old 
 cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or 
 early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). physicians should encourage patients to report 
 any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim 
 therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be 
 sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. if a decision to initiate antidepressant 
 pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of ariclaim is recommended (see 
 section 4.2).</p><p>use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. long-term safety 
 data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural 
 development are lacking.</p><p>medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). the use of more than one of 
 these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p><p>hepatitis/increased liver enzymes cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). most of them occurred 
 during the first months of treatment. the pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.</p><p>duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated 
 with hepatic injury.</p><p>
 akathisia/psychomotor restlessness the use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability 
 to sit or stand still. this is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. in patients who 
 develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.</p><p>
 sucrose ariclaim gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, ariclaim should 
 not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 22 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. caution is advisable if 
 ariclaim is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like 
 clomipramine or amitriptyline, st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum),</p><p>venlafaxine or triptans, 
 tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.</p><p>cns medicinal products: caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products 
 (benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>
 effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products medicinal products metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).</p><p>
 medicinal products metabolised by cyp2d6: duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6. when duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a 
 cyp2d6 substrate, the auc of desipramine increased 3-fold. the co-administration of duloxetine (40 
 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not 
 affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is 
 recommended. caution is advised if ariclaim is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
 predominantly metabolised by cyp2d6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas] such as 
 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such 
 as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding. 
 furthermore, increases in inr values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
 warfarin.</p><p>
 effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists
 : co-administration of ariclaim with aluminium- and magnesium-
 containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine 
 absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of ariclaim with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of 
 duloxetine. fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent 
 plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 0-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see 
 section 4.3).</p><p> 
 inducers of cyp1a2: population pharmacokinetic studies analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3). the potential risk for humans is unknown. withdrawal symptoms 
 may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. ariclaim is contraindicated 
 during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 23 breast feeding duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did</p><p>not breast feed their children . the estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately 
 0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). as the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the

 discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
 dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and 
 intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, 
 hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. 
 generally, for ssris and snris, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. it is therefore advised that when duloxetine 
 treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 26 electrocardiograms were obtained from 755 duloxetine-treated patients with sui and 779 placebo-treated patients in 12-week clinical trials. the heart rate-corrected qt interval in duloxetine-treated 
 patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>
 in the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic 
 pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-
 treated patients . hba
 1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. in the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in hba
 1c in both the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-
 treated group. there was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in 
 duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care 
 group.</p><p>

 in the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic 
 pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-
 29 treated patients. hba1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. in the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in hba1c in both 
 the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-
 treated group. there was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in 
 duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care 
 group.</p><p>
 electrocardiograms were obtained from 528 duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with 
 diabetic neuropathic pain in clinical trials lasting up to 13-weeks. the heart rate-corrected qt interval 
 in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients. no clinically 
 significant differences were observed for qt, pr, qrs, or qtcb measurements between duloxetine-
 treated and placebo-treated patients.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there is limited clinical experience with duloxetine overdose in humans. cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 4800mg were reported. some 
 fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with duloxetine alone at a dose of 
 approximately 1000 mg. signs and symptoms of overdose (mostly with mixed medicinal products) 
 included serotonin syndrome, somnolence, vomiting and seizures.</p><p>
 no specific antidote for duloxetine is known but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment 
 (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered.. a free airway should be 
 established. monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate 
 symptomatic and supportive measures. gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after 
 ingestion or in symptomatic patients. activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. 
 duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange 
 perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antidepressants.</p><p>atc code: n06ax21</p><p>
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors.</p><p>
 in animal studies, increased levels of 5-ht and ne in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral 
 tone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the 
 storage phase of the micturition cycle. a similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger 
 urethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine 
 in the treatment of women with sui.</p><p>
 duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory 
 pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. the pain inhibitory action of 
 duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the 
 central nervous system.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence:</p><p>
 the efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of sui was established in four 
 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with sui; of 
 these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. the primary efficacy measures 
 were incontinence episode frequency (ief) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life 
 questionnaire score (i-qol). 
 30</p><p>incontinence episode frequency: in all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater median decrease in ief compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. differences were observed 
 at each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54%, and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks 
 (52% and 33%) of medication.</p><p>
 in an additional study limited to patients with severe sui, all responses with duloxetine were achieved 
 within 2 weeks.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
 studies. the clinical benefit of ariclaim compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in 
 women with mild sui, defined in randomised trials as those with ief &lt; 14 per week.</p><p>in these women, 
 ariclaim may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural 
 interventions.</p><p>
 quality of life: incontinence quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire scores were significantly improved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the</p><p>placebo-treated group (9.2 versus 
 5.9 score improvement, p&lt;.001). using a global improvement scale (pgi), significantly more women 
 using duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment 
 compared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p&lt;.001).</p><p>
 ariclaim and prior continence surgery: there are limited data that suggest that the benefits of ariclaim are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously 
 undergone continence surgery.</p><p>ariclaim and pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt): during a 12-week blinded, randomised, controlled study, ariclaim demonstrated greater reductions in ief compared with either placebo 
 treatment or with pfmt alone.</p><p>combined therapy (duloxetine + pfmt) showed greater improvement 
 in both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than ariclaim alone or pfmt alone.</p><p>diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: the efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) 
 having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.</p><p>patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major 
 depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.</p><p>the primary outcome measure was the weekly 
 mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point likert 
 scale.</p><p>
 in both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
 compared with placebo. the effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. the 
 difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.</p><p>at least 
 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 
 40% for placebo. the corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% 
 respectively. clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to 
 whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. for patients not experiencing 
 somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients 
 on placebo.</p><p>clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 
 30% on placebo. patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
 unlikely to reach this level during further treatment.</p><p>
 although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, no 
 conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from placebo-
 controlled studies.</p><p>31</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a c
 max occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%; n=8 subjects). 
 food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases 
 the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).</p><p>
 duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin 
 and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both 
 cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 
 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to cyp2d6 has not 
 been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in 
 these patients.</p><p>
 the elimination half-life of duloxetine after an oral dose ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). 
 after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 
 36 l/hr) after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr 
 (mean 101 l/hr).</p></section><section><header>special populations:</header><p>gender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance is approximatively 50% lower in females). based upon the overlap in the range of 
 clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a 
 lower dose for female patients.</p><p>age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. as a general 
 recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had a 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared to healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic insufficiency: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>
 nursing mothers: the disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum. duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast 
 milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. the amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 
 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.</p><p>32 multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.</p><p>
 female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas 
 and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
 hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. the relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
 female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in 
 maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices 
 and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at 
 the most at maximum clinical exposure (auc). in an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher 
 incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels 
 below the maximun clinical exposure (auc). no malformations were observed in another study 
 testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. in pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, 
 duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposures levels below 
 maximum clinical exposure (auc).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. 
 what ariclaim is and what it is used for</header><p>ariclaim increases the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the nervous system. ariclaim is a medicine to be taken by mouth to treat stress urinary incontinence (sui) in women 
 or to treat a condition called diabetic neuropathic pain in adults.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence is a medical condition in which patients have accidental loss or leakage of 
 urine during physical exertion or activities such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, lifting, or exercise.</p><p>
 ariclaim is believed to work by increasing the strength of the muscle that holds back urine when 
 you laugh, sneeze, or perform physical activities.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim is reinforced when combined with a training program called pelvic floor 
 muscle training (pfmt).</p><p>
 neuropathic pain is a medical condition in which the pain is commonly described as burning, stabbing, 
 stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock.</p><p>there may be loss of feeling in the affected 
 area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain.</p><p>
 the effect of ariclaim may be noticeable in many patients with diabetic neuropathic pain within 1 
 week of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. 
 before you take ariclaim 
  
 do not take ariclaim</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients of 
 ariclaim.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine 
 oxidase inhibitor - maoi (see section below ‘taking other medicines’). 
 -</p><p>if you have liver disease.</p><p>-</p><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><p>50 - if you are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or 
 enoxacine which are used to treat some infections. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe kidney disease.</p><p>-</p><p>if you suffer from uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>take special care with ariclaim</header><p>the following are reasons why ariclaim may not be suitable for you. if any of them apply to you, talk to your doctor before you take the medicine:</p><p>
 -</p><p>you are taking other medicines to treat depression. 
 -</p><p>you are taking a herbal treatment containing st. john’s wort (hypericum perforatum). 
 -</p><p>you have kidney disease. 
 -</p><p>you have had seizures (fits). 
 -</p><p>you suffer from or have suffered from mania or bipolar disorder. 
 -</p><p>you have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye). 
 -</p><p>you have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises). 
 -</p><p>you are at risk of low sodium levels. 
 -</p><p>you have high blood pressure. 
 -</p><p>you are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage. 
 -</p><p>you are taking other medicines containing duloxetine.</p><p>-</p><p>you have intolerance to some sugars (see below).</p><p>-</p><p>you are considering stopping ariclaim (see section 3).</p><p> 
 ariclaim may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. you should tell 
 your doctor if this happens to you.</p><p>
 although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient 
 (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. suicidal thoughts and behaviours have been 
 reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. whilst depression and 
 other serious mental illnesses themselves are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and 
 actions, the risk of such symptoms might be higher in patients who have previously had thoughts of 
 self harm and in young adult patients. tell your doctor immediately if you have any distressing 
 thoughts or feelings at any time or if you are feeling changes in mood like sadness, apathy or agitation, 
 or if you start treatment for depression.</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age ariclaim should not be used for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, 
 suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when 
 they take this class of medicines.</p><p>also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, 
 and cognitive and behavioural development of ariclaim in this age group have not yet been 
 demonstrated.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. the main ingredient of ariclaim, duloxetine, 
 is used in other medicines for other conditions (depression and urinary incontinence). using more than 
 one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. check with your doctor if you are already 
 taking other medicines containing duloxetine.</p><p>your doctor should decide whether you can take ariclaim with other medicines. do not start or 
 stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, before 
 checking with your doctor.</p><p>
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maoi): you should not take ariclaim with an maoi or within 14 days of stopping an maoi. taking an maoi together with many prescription medicines, including 
 ariclaim, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. you must wait at least 14 days 
 51 after you have stopped taking an maoi before you can take ariclaim. also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking ariclaim before you take an maoi.</p><p>
 cns medicines: caution is advised when</p><p>ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicines(benzodiazepines, 
 morphinomimetics, antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines). 
 inform your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines.</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines that act in a similar way to duloxetine. examples of these medicines include: triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, certain 
 antidepressants: ssris (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine), tricyclics (such as clomipramine, 
 amitriptyline) and venlafaxine. these medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any 
 unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with ariclaim, you should see your 
 doctor.</p><p>oral -anticoagulants: you should tell you doctor if you are taking oral –anticoagulants (medicines which thin the blood).</p><p>these medicines might increase the risk of bleeding.</p></section><section><header>taking ariclaim with food and drink</header><p>ariclaim may be taken with or without food. you should take extra care if you drink alcohol while taking ariclaim.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ariclaim should not be used during pregnancy and if you are breast feeding. tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are taking ariclaim.</p><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>ariclaim may make you feel sleepy of dizzy. do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how ariclaim affects you

 the recommended dose of ariclaim for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence is 40 mg 
 twice a day (in the morning and late afternoon/evening). your doctor may decide to start your 
 treatment with one capsule of 20 mg twice a day for two weeks before increasing the dose to 40 mg 
 twice a day.</p><p>
 the usual dose of ariclaim for the treatment neuropathic pain is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor 
 will prescribe the dose that is right for you.</p><p>

 day.</p><p>

 missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. do not take more than the daily amount of 
 ariclaim that has been prescribed for you in one day.</p></section><section><header>if you stop taking  ariclaim</header><p>do not stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. if your doctor thinks that you no longer need ariclaim he will ask you to reduce your dose over 2 weeks. 
 some patients, who suddenly stop taking ariclaim after more than 1 week of therapy, have had 
 symptoms such as dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles, sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, 
 nightmares, inability to sleep), feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or 
 being sick (vomiting), tremor (shakiness), headaches, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating
