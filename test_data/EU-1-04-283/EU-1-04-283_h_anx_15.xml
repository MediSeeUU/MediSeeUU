 safety perspective in clinical trials.</p><p>the plasma concentration of duloxetine displays large inter-
 individual variability (see 5.2). hence, some patients that respond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit 
 from a higher dose.</p><p>
 response to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months. in patients with inadequate initial response, 
 additional response after this time is unlikely.</p><p>
 the therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 method of administration for oral use.</p><p>
 elderly no dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. however, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 children and adolescents duloxetine is not recommended for use in children due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy (see section 4.4).</p><p>hepatic impairment ariclaim must not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).</p><p>3renal impairment no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min). ariclaim must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment 
 (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min; see section 4.3).</p><p>
 discontinuation of treatment abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. when stopping treatment with ariclaim the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of 
 withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).if intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in 
 the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be 
 considered. subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>
 concomitant use of ariclaim with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
 (maois) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 ariclaim should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine (i.e. 
 potent cyp1a2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of 
 duloxetine (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the initiation of treatment with ariclaim is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled 
 hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 
 4.8).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>mania and seizures ariclaim should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures.</p><p>
 mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing ariclaim to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute 
 narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 blood pressure and heart rate duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients. this may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. cases of 
 hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing 
 hypertension. therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood 
 pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. duloxetine 
 should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart 
 rate or by an increase in blood pressure. caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used 
 with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). for patients who experience 
 a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual 
 discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). in patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
 duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).</p><p>4renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min).</p><p>for patients with severe renal impairment, see 
 section 4.3. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.</p><p>
 use with antidepressants caution should be exercised when using ariclaim in combination with antidepressants. in particular the combination with selective reversible maois is not recommended.</p><p>st john’s wort adverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of ariclaim and herbal preparations containing st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum).</p><p>
 depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medicinal product. depression is associated with an 
 increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). this risk persists 
 until significant remission occurs. as improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more 
 of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. it is general clinical 
 experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. patients with a history 
 of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to 
 commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal 
 behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. a meta-analysis of placebo-
 controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an 
 increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 
 years old. 
 cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or 
 early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). physicians should encourage patients to report 
 any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim 
 therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be 
 sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. if a decision to initiate antidepressant 
 pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of ariclaim is recommended (see 
 section 4.2).</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.</p><p>suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo.</p><p>if, based on 
 clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the 
 appearance of suicidal symptoms. in addition, long-term safety data in children and adolescents 
 concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are lacking.</p><p>
 haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and serotonin/noradrenaline 
 reuptake inhibitors (snris). caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal 
 products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.</p><p>
 hyponatraemia hyponatraemia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering ariclaim. caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia; such as elderly, 
 cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. hyponatraemia may be due to a 
 syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (siadh).</p><p>5discontinuation of treatment withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8). in clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation 
 occurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with ariclaim and 23% of patients taking 
 placebo.</p><p>
 the risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with ssri’s and snri’s may be dependent on several factors 
 including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. the most commonly 
 reported reactions are listed in section 4.8. generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, 
 in some patients they may be severe in intensity.</p><p>they usually occur within the first few days of 
 discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have 
 inadvertently missed a dose. generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 
 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).</p><p>it is therefore 
 advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no 
 less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 akathisia/psychomotor restlessness the use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability 
 to sit or stand still. this is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. in patients who 
 develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.</p><p>
 medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes, generalised anxiety disorder as well as stress urinary incontinence). 
 the use of more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p><p>
 hepatitis/increased liver enzymes</p><p>cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal), 
 hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). most of them occurred 
 during the first months of treatment. the pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.</p><p>duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated 
 with hepatic injury.</p><p>sucrose ariclaim gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>cns medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other cns-active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. 
 consequently, caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting 
 medicinal products and substances including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. 
 benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 for selective, reversible maois, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower. however, 
 the concomitant use of ariclaim with selective, reversible maois is not recommended (see section 
 4.4).</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris (e.g.</p><p>6paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. caution is advisable if ariclaim is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like 
 clomipramine or amitriptyline, st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum),</p><p>venlafaxine or triptans, 
 tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.</p><p>
 effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products medicinal products metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).</p><p>
 medicinal products metabolised by cyp2d6: duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6. when duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a 
 cyp2d6 substrate, the auc of desipramine increased 3-fold. the co-administration of duloxetine (40 
 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not 
 affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is 
 recommended. caution is advised if ariclaim is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
 predominantly metabolised by cyp2d6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas] such as 
 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such 
 as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding. 
 furthermore, increases in inr values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
 warfarin.</p><p>
 effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists: 
 co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of 
 duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp 1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. 
 fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent plasma 
 clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 o-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 inducers of cyp1a2: population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 the potential risk for humans is unknown. as with other serotonergic medicinal products, 
 discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. 
 ariclaim should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
 foetus. women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to 
 become pregnant, during therapy.</p><p>
 breast feeding duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did</p><p>not breast feed their children. the estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately</p><p>70.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). as the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of ariclaim while breast-feeding is not recommended.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. ariclaim may be associated with sedation and dizziness. patients should be instructed that if they experience 
 sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating 
 machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled clinical trials (comprising a total of 6828 patients, 4199 on duloxetine and 2629 on placebo) in 
 depression, generalized anxiety disorder and diabetic neuropathic pain.</p><p>
 the most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with ariclaim were nausea, 
 headache, dry mouth, somnolence, and dizziness. however, the majority of common adverse reactions 
 were mild to moderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as 
 therapy was continued.</p><p>

 3 see section 4.4 4 cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation. 
 5 cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4)</p><p>
 discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
 dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and 
 intense dreams), fatigue, agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, 
 diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. 
 generally, for ssris and snris, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. it is therefore advised that when duloxetine 
 treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 in the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic 
 pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-
 treated patients. hba1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. in the 
 extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in hba1c in both 
 the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-
 treated group. there was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in 
 duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care 
 group.</p><p>
 the heart rate-corrected qt interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in 
 placebo-treated patients. no clinically significant differences were observed for qt, pr, qrs, or 
 qtcb measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 5400 mg were reported. some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with 
 duloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine 
 alone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin 
 syndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.</p><p>
 no specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment 
 (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. a free airway should be 
 established. monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate 
 symptomatic and supportive measures. gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after 
 ingestion or in symptomatic patients. activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption.</p><p>11duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antidepressants. atc code: n06ax21.</p><p>
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and noradrenaline (na) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors. duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and 
 noradrenaline in various brain areas of animals.</p><p>
 duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory 
 pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. the pain inhibitory action of 
 duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the 
 central nervous system.</p><p>
 the efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 
 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) 
 having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.</p><p>patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major 
 depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.</p><p>the primary outcome measure was the weekly 
 mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point likert 
 scale.</p><p>
 in both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
 compared with placebo. the effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. the 
 difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.</p><p>at least 
 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 
 40% for placebo. the corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% 
 respectively. clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to 
 whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. for patients not experiencing 
 somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients 
 on placebo.</p><p>clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 
 30% on placebo. patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
 unlikely to reach this level during further treatment.</p><p>
 in an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of 
 acute treatment of ariclaim 60 mg once daily was maintained for a further 6-months as measured 
 by change on the brief pain inventory(bpi) 24-hour average pain item.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 absorption:</p><p>duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). food 
 delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the 
 extent of absorption (approximately 11 %). these changes do not have any clinical significance.</p><p>
 distribution: duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic</p><p>12impairment.</p><p>
 biotransformation: duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both cytochromes p450-2d6 and 1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites 
 glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy 
 duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers 
 with respect to cyp2d6 has not been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma 
 levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients.</p><p>
 elimination: the elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 
 36 l/hr).</p><p>after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr

 age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. as a general 
 recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared with healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers: the disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum. duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in 
 breast milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. the amount of duloxetine in breast milk is 
 approximately 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. lactation did not influence duloxetine

 discontinuation of treatment abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. when stopping treatment with ariclaim the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of 
 withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).if intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in 
 the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be 
 considered. subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing ariclaim to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute 
 narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 blood pressure and heart rate duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients. this may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. cases of 
 hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing 
 hypertension. therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood 
 pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. duloxetine 
 should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart 
 rate or by an increase in blood pressure. caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used 
 with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). for patients who experience 
 a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual 
 discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). in patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
 duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).</p><p>17renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min).</p><p>for patients with severe renal impairment, see 
 section 4.3. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.</p><p>
 use with antidepressants caution should be exercised when using ariclaim in combination with antidepressants. in particular the combination with selective reversible maois is not recommended.</p><p>st john’s wort adverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of ariclaim and herbal preparations containing st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum).</p><p>
 depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medicinal product. depression is associated with an 
 increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). this risk persists 
 until significant remission occurs. as improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more 
 of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. it is general clinical 
 experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. patients with a history 
 of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to 
 commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal 
 behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. a meta-analysis of placebo-
 controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an 
 increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 
 years old. 
 cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or 
 early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). physicians should encourage patients to report 
 any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim 
 therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be 
 sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. if a decision to initiate antidepressant 
 pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of ariclaim is recommended (see 
 section 4.2).</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.</p><p>suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo.</p><p>if, based on 
 clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the 
 appearance of suicidal symptoms. in addition, long-term safety data in children and adolescents 
 concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are lacking.</p><p>
 haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and serotonin/noradrenaline 
 reuptake inhibitors (snris). caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal 
 products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.</p><p>
 hyponatraemia hyponatraemia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering ariclaim. caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia; such as elderly, 
 cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. hyponatraemia may be due to a 
 syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (siadh).</p><p>18discontinuation of treatment withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8). in clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation 
 occurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with ariclaim and 23% of patients taking 
 placebo.</p><p>
 the risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with ssri’s and snri’s may be dependent on several factors 
 including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. the most commonly 
 reported reactions are listed in section 4.8. generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, 
 in some patients they may be severe in intensity.</p><p>they usually occur within the first few days of 
 discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have 
 inadvertently missed a dose. generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 
 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).</p><p>it is therefore 
 advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no 
 less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 akathisia/psychomotor restlessness the use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability 
 to sit or stand still. this is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. in patients who 
 develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.</p><p>
 medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes, generalised anxiety disorder as well as stress urinary incontinence). 
 the use of more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p><p>
 hepatitis/increased liver enzymes cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). most of them occurred 
 during the first months of treatment. the pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.</p><p>duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated 
 with hepatic injury.</p><p>
 sucrose ariclaim gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>cns medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other cns-active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. 
 consequently, caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting 
 medicinal products and substances including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. 
 benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 for selective, reversible maois, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower. however, 
 the concomitant use of ariclaim with selective, reversible maois is not recommended (see section 
 4.4).</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris (e.g.</p><p>19paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. caution is advisable if ariclaim is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like 
 clomipramine or amitriptyline, st john’s wort (hypericum perforatum),</p><p>venlafaxine or triptans, 
 tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.</p><p>
 effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products medicinal products metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).</p><p>
 medicinal products metabolised by cyp2d6: duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6. when duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a 
 cyp2d6 substrate, the auc of desipramine increased 3-fold. the co-administration of duloxetine (40 
 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not 
 affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is 
 recommended. caution is advised if ariclaim is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
 predominantly metabolised by cyp2d6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas] such as 
 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such 
 as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding. 
 furthermore, increases in inr values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
 warfarin.</p><p>
 effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists: 
 co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of 
 duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp 1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. 
 fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent plasma 
 clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 o-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 inducers of cyp1a2: population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 the potential risk for humans is unknown. as with other serotonergic medicinal products, 
 discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. 
 ariclaim should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
 foetus. women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to 
 become pregnant, during therapy.</p><p>
 breast feeding duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did</p><p>not breast feed their children. the estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately</p><p>200.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). as the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of ariclaim while breast-feeding is not recommended.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. ariclaim may be associated with sedation and dizziness. patients should be instructed that if they experience

 the most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with ariclaim were nausea,

 3 see section 4.4 4 cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation. 
 5 cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4)</p><p>
 discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
 dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and 
 intense dreams), fatigue, agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, 
 diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. 
 generally, for ssris and snris, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in 
 some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. it is therefore advised that when duloxetine 
 treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 in the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic 
 pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-
 treated patients. hba1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. in the 
 extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in hba1c in both 
 the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-
 treated group. there was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in 
 duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care 
 group.</p><p>
 the heart rate-corrected qt interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in 
 placebo-treated patients. no clinically significant differences were observed for qt, pr, qrs, or 
 qtcb measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 5400 mg were reported. some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with 
 duloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine 
 alone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin 
 syndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.</p><p>
 no specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment 
 (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. a free airway should be

 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and noradrenaline (na) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors. duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and 
 noradrenaline in various brain areas of animals.</p><p>
 duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory 
 pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. the pain inhibitory action of 
 duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the 
 central nervous system.</p><p>
 the efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 
 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) 
 having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.</p><p>patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major 
 depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.</p><p>the primary outcome measure was the weekly 
 mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point likert 
 scale.</p><p>
 in both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
 compared with placebo. the effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. the 
 difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.</p><p>at least 
 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 
 40% for placebo. the corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% 
 respectively. clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to 
 whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. for patients not experiencing 
 somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients 
 on placebo.</p><p>clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 
 30% on placebo. patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
 unlikely to reach this level during further treatment</p><p>
 in an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of 
 acute treatment of ariclaim 60 mg once daily was maintained for a further 6-months as measured 
 by change on the brief pain inventory(bpi) 24-hour average pain item.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 absorption:</p><p>duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). food 
 delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the 
 extent of absorption (approximately 11 %). these changes do not have any clinical significance.</p><p>
 distribution: duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic</p><p>25impairment.</p><p>
 biotransformation: duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both cytochromes p450-2d6 and 1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites 
 glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy 
 duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers 
 with respect to cyp2d6 has not been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma 
 levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients.</p><p>
 elimination: the elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 
 36 l/hr).</p><p>after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr 
 (mean 101 l/hr).</p></section><section><header>special populations:</header><p>gender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance is approximately 50% lower in females). based upon the overlap in the range of 
 clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a 
 lower dose for female patients.</p><p>
 age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. as a general 
 recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared with healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers: the disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum. duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in 
 breast milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. the amount of duloxetine in breast milk is 
 approximately 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. lactation did not influence duloxetine 
 pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.</p><p>multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes</p><p>in the rat 
 carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.</p><p>female 
 mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and 
 carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
 hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. the relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
 female rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a 
 decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live 
 birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels 
 estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (auc). in an embryotoxicity study in the 
 rabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic 
 exposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (auc). no malformations were observed in 
 another study testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. in prenatal/postnatal toxicity</p><p>26studies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below maximum clinical exposure (auc).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what ariclaim is and what it is used for</header><p>ariclaim increases the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in the nervous system.</p><p>
 ariclaim is used in adults to treat a condition called diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as 
 burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock. there may be loss of feeling 
 in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain).</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you take ariclaim
   do not take ariclaim if you:</header><p>− are allergic (hypersensitive) to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of ariclaim − have liver disease − have severe kidney disease − are taking or have recently taken within the last 14 days, another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) (see also below in section: ‘taking other medicines’) 
 − are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine which are used to treat some infections 
 − are taking other medicines containing duloxetine talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. your doctor will tell you if you 
 should be taking ariclaim.</p></section><section><header>take special care with ariclaim</header><p>the following are reasons why ariclaim may not be suitable for you. talk to your doctor before you take the medicine if you: 
 -</p><p>are taking other medicines to treat depression (see ‘taking other medicines’) 
 -</p><p>are taking st. john’s wort, a herbal treatment (hypericum perforatum) 
 -</p><p>have kidney disease 
 -</p><p>have had seizures (fits) 
 -</p><p>have had mania 
 -</p><p>suffer from bipolar disorder 
 -</p><p>have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye)</p><p>40- have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises) 
 -</p><p>are at risk of low sodium levels 
 -</p><p>are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage 
 -</p><p>are taking other medicines containing duloxetine</p><p>
 ariclaim may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. you should tell 
 your doctor if this happens to you.</p></section><section><header>thoughts of suicide and worsening of depression or anxiety disorder</header><p>although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an 
 antidepressant medicine. if you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have 
 thoughts of harming or killing yourself. these may be increased when first starting antidepressants, 
 since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. 
 you may be more likely to think like this if you:</p><p>
 - 
 have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself 
 - 
 are a young adult. information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal 
 behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an 
 antidepressant</p></section><section><header>if you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away.</header><p>you may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety 
 disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. you might ask them to tell you if they think your depression 
 or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour.</p></section><section><header>use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age</header><p>ariclaim should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, 
 suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when 
 they take this class of medicines. despite this, your doctor may prescribe ariclaim for patients 
 under 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. if your doctor has prescribed 
 ariclaim for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. you 
 should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 
 18 are taking ariclaim. also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and 
 cognitive and behavioural development of ariclaim in this age group have not yet been 
 demonstrated.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. the main ingredient of ariclaim, duloxetine, 
 is used in other medicines for other conditions: 
 • depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence using more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. check with your doctor if 
 you are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine.</p><p>
 your doctor should decide whether you can take ariclaim with other medicines.</p></section><section><header>do not start or stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, 
 before checking with your doctor.</header><p>you should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:</p></section><section><header>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois):</header><p> you should not take ariclaim if you are taking, or have recently taken within the last 14 days, another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase 
 inhibitor (maoi).</p><p>taking a maoi together with many prescription medicines, including 
 ariclaim, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. you must wait at least 14 days 
 after you have stopped taking an maoi before you can take ariclaim. also, you need to wait at 
 least 5 days after you stop taking ariclaim before you take a maoi.</p><p> 41</p></section><section><header>medicines that cause sleepiness:</header><p> these include medicines prescribed by your doctor including benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, antihistamines.</p></section><section><header>medicines that increase the level of serotonin:</header><p>triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, ssris (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine), tricyclics (such as clomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, st john’s wort 
 and venlafaxine. these medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom 
 taking any of these medicines together with ariclaim, you should see your doctor.</p></section><section><header>oral anticoagulants:</header><p>medicines which thin the blood. these medicines might increase the risk of bleeding.</p></section><section><header>taking ariclaim with food and drink</header><p>ariclaim may be taken with or without food. care should be taken if you drink alcohol while you are being treated with ariclaim.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. tell your doctor if you: 
 • become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are taking ariclaim. you should use ariclaim only after discussing the potential benefits and any potential risks to 
 your unborn child with your doctor. 
 • are breast-feeding. the use of ariclaim while breastfeeding is not recommended. you should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>ariclaim may make you feel sleepy of dizzy. do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how ariclaim affects you.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of ariclaim</header><p>ariclaim contains</p></section><section><header>sucrose</header><p>. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to take ariclaim</header><p>always take ariclaim exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p>
 ariclaim starts to work in most people with diabetic neuropathic pain within 1 week of starting 
 treatment.</p><p>
 the usual dose of ariclaim is 1 capsule (60 mg) once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose 
 that is right for you.</p><p>
 ariclaim is for oral use. you should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water.</p><p>
 to help you remember to take ariclaim, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every 
 day.</p><p>
 talk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking ariclaim. do not stop taking 
 ariclaim without talking to your doctor.</p></section><section><header>if you take more ariclaim than you should</header><p>call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of ariclaim prescribed by your doctor. symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, fits, vomiting, fast heart 
 rate and serotonin syndrome (defined below in ‘other possible side effects’).</p><p>42</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take ariclaim</header><p>if you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.</p><p>however, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
 dose. do not take more than the daily amount of ariclaim that has been prescribed for you in one 
 day.</p></section><section><header>if you stop taking ariclaim</header><p>do not stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. if your doctor thinks that you no longer need ariclaim he will ask you to reduce your dose over at least 2 
 weeks before stopping treatment altogether. some patients who stop taking ariclaim suddenly have 
 had symptoms such as dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles, sleep disturbances (vivid 
 dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick 
 (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), tremor (shakiness), headaches, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive
