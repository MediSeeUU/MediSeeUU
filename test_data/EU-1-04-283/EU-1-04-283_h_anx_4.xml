 therapy. some patients may benefit from starting treatment at a dose of 20 mg twice daily for two 
 weeks before increasing to the recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily.</p><p>dose escalation may 
 decrease, though not eliminate, the risk of nausea and dizziness. 
 however, limited data are available to support the efficacy of ariclaim 20 mg twice daily. 
 a 20 mg capsule is also available.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
 studies. the benefit of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals.</p><p>
 combining ariclaim with a pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt) program may be more effective 
 than either treatment alone. it is recommended that consideration be given to concomitant pfmt.</p><p>
 hepatic insufficiency: ariclaim should not be used in women with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 renal insufficiency: no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min).</p><p>
 elderly: caution should be exercised when treating the elderly.</p><p>
 3 children and adolescents: the safety and efficacy of duloxetine in patients in these age groups have not been studied. therefore, administration of ariclaim to children and adolescents is not recommended.</p><p>
 discontinuation of treatment: when discontinuing ariclaim after more than 1 week of therapy, it is generally recommended that the dose be tapered (from 40 mg twice daily to either 40 mg once daily or 20 mg twice daily) for 2 
 weeks before discontinuation in an effort to decrease the risk of possible discontinuation symptoms 
 (see section 4.4).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>
 liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 ariclaim should not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase 
 inhibitors - maois (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 ariclaim should not be used in combination with cyp1a2 inhibitors, like fluvoxamine, 
 ciprofloxacin or enoxacine since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of 
 duloxetine (see section 4.5).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>mania and seizures ariclaim should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures.</p><p>
 use with antidepressants the use of ariclaim in combination with antidepressants (especially with ssri, snri and reversible maois) is not recommended (see below “depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour” and 
 section 4.5).</p><p>mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-
 angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). patients with severe renal impairment are unlikely to 
 be affected by sui. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal 
 dysfunction.</p><p>
 sucrose ariclaim hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p><p>haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses and purpura with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). caution is advised in patients taking, anticoagulants 
 and/or medicinal products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding 
 tendencies. 
 4</p><p>discontinuation of treatment some patients may experience symptoms on discontinuation of ariclaim, particularly if treatment is stopped abruptly (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 hyponatremia hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantely in the elderly, when administering ariclaim and other drugs of the same pharmacodynamic class.</p><p>depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. isolated cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal 
 behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. 
 physicians should encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive 
 symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive 
 symptoms, specialised medical advice should be sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. 
 if a decision to initiate antidepressant pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of 
 ariclaim is recommended (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. long-term safety 
 data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural 
 development are lacking.</p><p>
 medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). the use of more than one of 
 these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, ariclaim should 
 not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. the use of ariclaim in combination with 
 serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, venlafaxine, or 
 triptans, tramadol and tryptophan is not recommended.</p><p>cns drugs: caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs or substances, including alcohol and sedative drugs (benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, 
 antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>effects of duloxetine on other drugs drugs metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 in a clinical study, the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily). 
 the study was performed in males and it can not be excluded that females having a lower cyp1a2 
 activity and higher plasma concentrations of duloxetine may experience an interaction with a cyp1a2 
 substrate.</p><p>
 5 drugs metabolised by cyp2d6: the co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71% but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
 its active 5-hydroxy metabolite, and no dosage adjustment is recommended. caution is advised if 
 duloxetine is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 if they have a narrow therapeutic index.</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 effects of other drugs on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists
 : co-administration of ariclaim with aluminium- and magnesium-
 containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine 
 absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of ariclaim with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of 
 duloxetine. fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent 
 plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 0-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see 
 section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3). the potential risk for humans is unknown. withdrawal symptoms 
 may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. ariclaim is contraindicated 
 during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 breast feeding duloxetine and/or its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. adverse behavioural effects were seen in offspring in a peri-post natal toxicity study in rats (see 5.3). excretion of 
 duloxetine and/or metabolites into human milk has not been studied. ariclaim is contraindicated 
 while breast-feeding (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>although in controlled studies duloxetine has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, cognitive function, or memory, it may be associated with sedation. therefore, patients should be 
 cautioned about their ability to drive a car or operate hazardous machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the safety of ariclaim has been evaluated in four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with sui, including 958 duloxetine-treated and 955 placebo-treated patients. this represents 
 190 patient-years of exposure at 40 mg twice daily.</p><p>
 the most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with ariclaim were nausea, dry 
 mouth, fatigue, insomnia, and constipation. adverse events that occurred significantly more often in 
 patients taking duloxetine than placebo and with a frequency of 
 ≥2% or were of potential clinical relevance, are displayed in tables 1, 2, and 3.</p><p>
 the data analysis showed that the onset of the reported adverse events typically occurred in the first 
 week of therapy. however, the majority of the most frequent adverse events were mild to moderate 
 and resolved within 30 days of occurrence (e.g. nausea).</p><p>6</p><p>frequency estimate: very common (≥10%), common (≥1% and &lt;10%), and uncommon (≥0.1% and &lt;1%).</p></section><section><header>table 1 very common undesirable effects (</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header>10%) system organ class

 dizziness (
 ≥5%) was also reported as a common adverse event upon duloxetine discontinuation.</p><p>
 duloxetine treatment, for up to 12 weeks in placebo-controlled clinical trials, was associated with 
 small mean increases from baseline to endpoint in alt, ast and creatinine phosphokinase - cpk 
 (2.1 u/l, 1.3 u/l, and 5.8 u/l respectively); infrequent, transient, abnormal values were observed 
 more often for these analytes in duloxetine-treated patients, compared with placebo-treated patients. 
 7</p><p>electrocardiograms were obtained from 755 duloxetine-treated patients with sui and 779 placebo-treated patients in 12-week clinical trials. the heart rate-corrected qt interval in duloxetine-treated 
 patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>
 in clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically 
 significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-treated patients compared to 
 placebo at 12 weeks and routine care at 52 weeks. the increase was similar at both time points and 
 was not considered clinically relevant. relative to placebo or routine care, mean hba1c values were 
 stable, there was no mean weight gain, mean lipid concentrations (cholesterol, ldl, hdl, 
 triglycerides) were stable, and there were no differences in incidence of serious and non-serious 
 diabetes-related adverse reactions.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there is limited clinical experience with duloxetine overdose in humans. in pre-marketing clinical trials, no cases of fatal overdose of duloxetine have been reported. four non-fatal acute ingestions of 
 duloxetine (300 to 1400 mg), alone or in combination with other medicinal products have been 
 reported.</p><p>
 no specific antidote for duloxetine is known. a free airway should be established. monitoring of 
 cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate symptomatic and supportive measures. 
 gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. 
 activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. duloxetine has a large volume of distribution 
 and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antidepressants.</p><p>atc code: n06ax21</p><p>
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors.</p><p>
 in animal studies, increased levels of 5-ht and ne in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral 
 tone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the 
 storage phase of the micturition cycle. a similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger 
 urethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine 
 in the treatment of women with sui.</p><p>
 the efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of sui was established in four 
 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with sui; of 
 these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. the primary efficacy measures 
 were incontinence episode frequency (ief) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life 
 questionnaire score (i-qol).</p><p>
 incontinence episode frequency: in all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater median decrease in ief compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. differences were observed 
 at each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54%, and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks 
 (52% and 33%) of medication.</p><p>
 in an additional study limited to patients with severe sui, all responses with duloxetine were achieved 
 within 2 weeks.</p><p>
 8 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled studies. the clinical benefit of ariclaim compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in 
 women with mild sui, defined in randomised trials as those with ief &lt; 14 per week.</p><p>in these women, 
 ariclaim may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural 
 interventions.</p><p>
 quality of life: incontinence quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire scores were significantly improved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the</p><p>placebo-treated group (9.2 versus 
 5.9 score improvement, p&lt;.001). using a global improvement scale (pgi), significantly more women 
 using duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment 
 compared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p&lt;.001).</p><p>
 ariclaim and prior continence surgery: there are limited data that suggest that the benefits of ariclaim are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously 
 undergone continence surgery.</p><p>ariclaim and pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt): during a 12-week blinded, randomised, controlled study, ariclaim demonstrated greater reductions in ief compared with either placebo 
 treatment or with pfmt alone.</p><p>combined therapy (duloxetine + pfmt) showed greater improvement 
 in both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than ariclaim alone or pfmt alone.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a c
 max occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%; n=8 subjects). 
 food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases 
 the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).</p><p>
 duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin 
 and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both 
 cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 
 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to cyp2d6 has not 
 been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in 
 these patients.</p><p>
 the elimination half-life of duloxetine after an oral dose ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 
 hours). after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr 
 (mean of 36 l/hr) after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 
 l/hr (mean 101 l/hr).</p></section><section><header>special populations:</header><p>age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose.</p><p>
 renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had a 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared to healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 9</p><p>hepatic insufficiency: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.</p><p>multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat 
 carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.</p><p>
 female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas 
 and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
 hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. the relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
 female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in 
 maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices 
 and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at 
 the most at maximum clinical exposure (auc). in an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher 
 incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels 
 below the maximun clinical exposure (auc). no malformations were observed in another study 
 testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. in pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, 
 duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposures levels below 
 maximum clinical exposure (auc).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients

 ariclaim should not be used in combination with cyp1a2 inhibitors, like fluvoxamine, 
 ciprofloxacin or enoxacine since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of 
 duloxetine (see section 4.5).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>mania and seizures ariclaim should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures.</p><p>
 use with antidepressants the use of ariclaim in combination with antidepressants (especially with ssri, snri and reversible maois) is not recommended (see below “depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour” and 
 section 4.5).</p><p>mydriasis mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-
 angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 renal impairment increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). patients with severe renal impairment are unlikely to 
 be affected by sui. see section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal 
 dysfunction.</p><p>
 sucrose ariclaim hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
 take this medicine.</p><p>haemorrhage</p><p>there have been reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses and purpura with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). caution is advised in patients taking, anticoagulants 
 and/or medicinal products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding 
 tendencies. 
 13</p><p>discontinuation of treatment some patients may experience symptoms on discontinuation of ariclaim, particularly if treatment is stopped abruptly (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 hyponatremia hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantely in the elderly, when administering ariclaim and other drugs of the same pharmacodynamic class.</p><p>depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. isolated cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal 
 behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. 
 physicians should encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive 
 symptoms at any time. if while on ariclaim therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive 
 symptoms, specialised medical advice should be sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. 
 if a decision to initiate antidepressant pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of 
 ariclaim is recommended (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age no clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. ariclaim should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children 
 and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. long-term safety 
 data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural 
 development are lacking.</p><p>
 medicinal products containing duloxetine duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). the use of more than one of 
 these products concomitantly should be avoided.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, ariclaim should 
 not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), or 
 within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an maoi. based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
 at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping ariclaim before starting an maoi (see section 
 4.3).</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using ssris concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. the use of ariclaim in combination with 
 serotonergic antidepressants like ssris, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, venlafaxine, or 
 triptans, tramadol and tryptophan is not recommended.</p><p>cns drugs: caution is advised when ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs or substances, including alcohol and sedative drugs (benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, 
 antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).</p><p>effects of duloxetine on other drugs drugs metabolised by cyp1a2: 
 in a clinical study, the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a cyp1a2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily). 
 the study was performed in males and it can not be excluded that females having a lower cyp1a2 
 activity and higher plasma concentrations of duloxetine may experience an interaction with a cyp1a2 
 substrate.</p><p>
 14 drugs metabolised by cyp2d6: the co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state auc of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71% but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
 its active 5-hydroxy metabolite, and no dosage adjustment is recommended. caution is advised if 
 duloxetine is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 if they have a narrow therapeutic index.</p><p>
 oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of cyp3a. specific 
 in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>
 effects of other drugs on duloxetine antacids and h2 antagonists
 : co-administration of ariclaim with aluminium- and magnesium-
 containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine 
 absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.</p><p>
 inhibitors of cyp1a2: because cyp1a2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of ariclaim with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of 
 duloxetine. fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, decreased the apparent 
 plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased auc
 0-t 6-fold. therefore ariclaim should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of cyp1a2 like fluvoxamine (see 
 section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (auc) of duloxetine lower than the maximum 
 clinical exposure (see section 5.3). the potential risk for humans is unknown. withdrawal symptoms 
 may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. ariclaim is contraindicated 
 during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 breast feeding duloxetine and/or its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. adverse behavioural effects were seen in offspring in a peri-post natal toxicity study in rats (see 5.3). excretion of 
 duloxetine and/or metabolites into human milk has not been studied.</p><p>ariclaim is contraindicated 
 while breast-feeding (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>although in controlled studies duloxetine has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, cognitive function, or memory, it may be associated with sedation. therefore, patients should be 
 cautioned about their ability to drive a car or operate hazardous machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the safety of ariclaim has been evaluated in four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with sui, including 958 duloxetine-treated and 955 placebo-treated patients. this represents

 the most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with ariclaim were nausea, dry 
 mouth, fatigue, insomnia, and constipation. adverse events that occurred significantly more often in 
 patients taking duloxetine than placebo and with a frequency of 
 ≥2% or were of potential clinical relevance, are displayed in tables 1, 2, and 3.</p><p>
 the data analysis showed that the onset of the reported adverse events typically occurred in the first 
 week of therapy. however, the majority of the most frequent adverse events were mild to moderate

 dizziness (

 duloxetine treatment, for up to 12 weeks in placebo-controlled clinical trials, was associated with 
 small mean increases from baseline to endpoint in alt, ast and creatinine phosphokinase - cpk 
 (2.1 u/l, 1.3 u/l, and 5.8 u/l respectively); infrequent, transient, abnormal values were observed 
 more often for these analytes in duloxetine-treated patients, compared with placebo-treated patients. 
 16</p><p>electrocardiograms were obtained from 755 duloxetine-treated patients with sui and 779 placebo-treated patients in 12-week clinical trials. the heart rate-corrected qt interval in duloxetine-treated 
 patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>
 in clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically 
 significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-treated patients compared to 
 placebo at 12 weeks and routine care at 52 weeks. the increase was similar at both time points and 
 was not considered clinically relevant. relative to placebo or routine care, mean hba1c values were 
 stable, there was no mean weight gain, mean lipid concentrations (cholesterol, ldl, hdl, 
 triglycerides) were stable, and there were no differences in incidence of serious and non-serious 
 diabetes-related adverse reactions.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there is limited clinical experience with duloxetine overdose in humans. in pre-marketing clinical trials, no cases of fatal overdose of duloxetine have been reported. four non-fatal acute ingestions of 
 duloxetine (300 to 1400 mg), alone or in combination with other medicinal products have been 
 reported.</p><p>
 no specific antidote for duloxetine is known. a free airway should be established. monitoring of 
 cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate symptomatic and supportive measures. 
 gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. 
 activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. duloxetine has a large volume of distribution 
 and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antidepressants. atc code: n06ax21</p><p>
 duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor. it weakly 
 inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
 and adrenergic receptors.</p><p>
 in animal studies, increased levels of 5-ht and ne in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral 
 tone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the 
 storage phase of the micturition cycle. a similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger 
 urethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine 
 in the treatment of women with sui.</p><p>
 the efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of sui was established in four 
 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with sui; of 
 these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. the primary efficacy measures 
 were incontinence episode frequency (ief) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life 
 questionnaire score (i-qol).</p><p>
 incontinence episode frequency: in all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater median decrease in ief compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. differences were observed 
 at each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54%, and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks 
 (52% and 33%) of medication.</p><p>
 in an additional study limited to patients with severe sui, all responses with duloxetine were achieved 
 within 2 weeks.</p><p>
 17 the efficacy of ariclaim has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled studies. the clinical benefit of ariclaim compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in 
 women with mild sui, defined in randomised trials as those with ief &lt; 14 per week.</p><p>in these women, 
 ariclaim may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural 
 interventions.</p><p>
 quality of life: incontinence quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire scores were significantly improved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the</p><p>placebo-treated group (9.2 versus 
 5.9 score improvement, p&lt;.001). using a global improvement scale (pgi), significantly more women 
 using duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment 
 compared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p&lt;.001).</p><p>
 ariclaim and prior continence surgery: there are limited data that suggest that the benefits of ariclaim are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously 
 undergone continence surgery.</p><p>ariclaim and pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt): during a 12-week blinded, randomised, controlled study, ariclaim demonstrated greater reductions in ief compared with either placebo 
 treatment or with pfmt alone.</p><p>combined therapy (duloxetine + pfmt) showed greater improvement 
 in both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than ariclaim alone or pfmt alone.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (cyp1a2 and the polymorphic cyp2d6), followed by conjugation. the pharmacokinetics 
 of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
 smoking status and cyp2d6 metaboliser status.</p><p>
 duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a c
 max occurring 6 hours post dose. the absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%; n=8 subjects). 
 food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases 
 the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).</p><p>
 duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. duloxetine binds to both albumin 
 and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. both 
 cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 
 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. based upon 
 in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to cyp2d6 has not 
 been specifically investigated. limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in 
 these patients.</p><p>
 the elimination half-life of duloxetine after an oral dose ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 
 hours). after an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr 
 (mean of 36 l/hr) after an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 
 l/hr (mean 101 l/hr).</p></section><section><header>special populations:</header><p>age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (auc increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the 
 magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose.</p><p>
 renal impairment: end stage renal disease (esrd) patients receiving dialysis had a 2-fold higher duloxetine c
 max and auc values compared to healthy subjects. pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>
 18</p><p>hepatic insufficiency: moderate liver disease (child pugh class b) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
 lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the auc was 3.7 times higher in 
 patients with moderate liver disease. the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
 been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.</p><p>multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat 
 carcinogenicity study. the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.</p><p>
 female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas 
 and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
 hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. the relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
 female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in 
 maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices 
 and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at 
 the most at maximum clinical exposure (auc). in an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher 
 incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels 
 below the maximun clinical exposure (auc). no malformations were observed in another study 
 testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. in pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, 
 duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposures levels below 
 maximum clinical exposure (auc).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients

 ariclaim is a medicine to be taken by mouth to treat stress urinary incontinence (sui) in women.</p><p>
 stress urinary incontinence is a medical condition in which patients have accidental loss or leakage of 
 urine during physical exertion or activities such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, lifting, or exercise.</p><p>
 36 ariclaim is believed to work by increasing the strength of the muscle that holds back urine when you laugh, sneeze, or perform physical activities.</p><p>
 the efficacy of ariclaim is reinforced when combined with a training program called pelvic floor 
 muscle training (pfmt).</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you take ariclaim</header><p>ariclaim can only be prescribed by a doctor.</p></section><section><header>do not take ariclaim:</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients of 
 ariclaim.</p><p>
 - 
 if you are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine 
 oxidase inhibitor - maoi (see section below ‘taking other medicines’). 
 - 
 if you have liver disease.</p><p>- 
 if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><p>- 
 if you are taking a potent inhibitor of a liver enzyme called cyp1a2, like fluvoxamine, 
 ciprofloxacin or enoxacine.</p></section><section><header>take special care with ariclaim:</header><p>the following are reasons why ariclaim may not be suitable for you. if any of them apply to you, talk to your doctor before you take the medicine:</p><p>
 - 
 if you are taking medicines to treat depression. 
 - 
 you have kidney disease. 
 - 
 you have a history of seizures (fits). 
 - 
 you have a history of mania or bipolar disorder. 
 - 
 you have eye problems such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye). 
 - 
 you have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises). 
 - 
 if you are younger than 18 years.</p><p>
 although ariclaim is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient 
 (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. isolated cases of suicidal thoughts and 
 behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. tell 
 your doctor immediately if you have any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time or if you are 
 feeling changes in mood like sadness, apathy or agitation, or if you start treatment for depression.</p><p>
 use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age ariclaim should not be used for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, 
 suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when 
 they take this class of medicines.</p><p>also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, 
 and cognitive and behavioural development of ariclaim in this age group have not yet been 
 demonstrated.</p></section><section><header>taking ariclaim with food and drink:</header><p>ariclaim may be taken with or without food. ariclaim has not been shown to increase the effects of alcohol. even so, you should take extra care if you drink alcohol while taking ariclaim.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding:</header><p>ariclaim should not be used during pregnancy and if you are breast feeding. tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are taking ariclaim.</p><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 37</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines:</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines until you know how ariclaim affects you.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of ariclaim:</header><p>ariclaim contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines:</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed. the main ingredient of ariclaim, duloxetine, is used in other medicines 
 for other conditions (diabetic neuropathic pain, depression and urinary incontinence). using more than 
 one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. check with your doctor if you are already 
 taking other medicines containing duloxetine.</p><p>your doctor should decide whether you can take ariclaim with other medicines. do not start or 
 stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, before 
 checking with your doctor.</p><p>
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maoi): you should not take ariclaim with an maoi or within 14 days of stopping an maoi. taking an maoi together with many prescription medicines, including 
 ariclaim, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. you must wait at least 14 days 
 after you have stopped taking an maoi before you can take ariclaim. also, you need to wait at 
 least 5 days after you stop taking ariclaim before you take an maoi.</p><p>
 cns drugs: caution is advised when</p><p>ariclaim is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs or substances, including alcohol and sedative drugs (benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, 
 antipsychotics,</p><p>phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines). 
 inform your doctor if you are taking any of these drugs.</p><p>
 serotonin syndrome: you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines that act in a similar way to duloxetine. examples of these medicines include: triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, certain 
 antidepressants: ssris (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine), tricyclics (such as clomipramine, 
 amitriptyline) and venlafaxine. these medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any 
 unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with ariclaim, you should see your 
 doctor.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to take ariclaim</header><p>always take ariclaim exactly as your doctor tells you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.</p><p>
 the recommended dose of ariclaim is one capsule of 40 mg twice a day (in the morning and late 
 afternoon/evening). your doctor may decide to start your treatment with one capsule of 20 mg twice a 
 day for two weeks before increasing the dose to 40 mg twice a day. if you think that the effect of 
 ariclaim is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.</p><p>
 ariclaim is for oral use. you should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water.</p><p>
 to help you remember to take ariclaim, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every 
 day.</p><p>
 do not stop taking ariclaim without talking to your doctor.</p></section><section><header>if you take more ariclaim than you should:</header><p>call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of ariclaim prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>
 38</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take ariclaim:</header><p>do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses.</p><p>
 if you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. however, if it is time for your next dose, skip the 
 missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. do not take more than the daily amount of 
 ariclaim that has been prescribed for you in one day.</p></section><section><header>effect when treatment with ariclaim is stopped</header><p>: do not stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. if your 
 doctor thinks that you no longer need ariclaim he will ask you to reduce your dose over 2 weeks. 
 some patients, who suddenly stop taking ariclaim after more than 1 week of therapy, have felt 
 dizzy, sick (nausea) or had a headache. these symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a 
 few days, but if you have symptoms that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, ariclaim can have side effects. these effects are normally mild to moderate and often disappear after a short time.</p><p>
 very common (
 ≥10%) side effects with ariclaim may include: not being able to sleep, feeling sick (nausea), dry mouth, constipation and tiredness.</p><p>
