  ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) and lymphoid blast cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.</p><p>
 dasatinib accordpharma is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with: 
  newly diagnosed ph+ cml in chronic phase (ph+ cml-cp) or ph+ cml-cp resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. 
  newly diagnosed ph+ all in combination with chemotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with leukaemia.</p><p>
 posology 
 adult patients the recommended starting dose for chronic phase cml is 100 mg dasatinib once daily.</p><p>
 the recommended starting dose for accelerated, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) 
 cml or ph+ all is 140 mg once daily (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 paediatric population (ph+ cml-cp and ph+ all) dosing for children and adolescents is on the basis of body weight (see table 1). dasatinib is administered orally once daily in the form of either dasatinib accordpharma film-coated tablets or 
 4</p><p>dasatinib powder for oral suspension. the dose should be recalculated every 3 months based on changes in body weight, or more often if necessary. the tablet is not recommended for patients 
 weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for these patients. dose 
 increase or reduction is recommended based on individual patient response and tolerability. there is 
 no experience with dasatinib accordpharma treatment in children under 1 year of age.</p><p>
 dasatinib accordpharma film-coated tablets and dasatinib powder for oral suspension are not 
 bioequivalent. patients who are able to swallow tablets and who desire to switch from dasatinib 
 powder for oral suspension to dasatinib accordpharma tablets or patients who are not able to swallow 
 tablets and who desire to switch from tablets to oral suspension, may do so, provided that the correct 
 dosing recommendations for the dosage form are followed.</p><p>
 the recommended starting daily dosage of dasatinib accordpharma tablets in paediatric patients is 
 shown in table 1.</p></section><section><header>table 1: dosage of dasatinib accordpharma tablets for paediatric patients with ph+ cml-cp or ph+ all

 100 mg a the tablet is not recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for these patients.</p><p>
 treatment duration in clinical studies, treatment with dasatinib in adults with ph+ cml-cp, accelerated, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) cml, or ph+ all and paediatric patients with ph+ cml-cp 
 was continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the patient. the effect of 
 stopping treatment on long-term disease outcome after the achievement of a cytogenetic or molecular 
 response [including complete cytogenetic response (ccyr), major molecular response (mmr) and 
 mr4.5] has not been investigated.</p><p>
 in clinical studies, treatment with dasatinib in paediatric patients with ph+ all was administered 
 continuously, added to successive blocks of backbone chemotherapy, for a maximum duration of two 
 years. in patients that receive a subsequent stem cell transplantation, dasatinib can be administered for 
 an additional year post-transplantation.</p><p>
 to achieve the recommended dose, dasatinib accordpharma is available as 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 
 80 mg, 100 mg and 140 mg film-coated tablets. dose increase or reduction is recommended based on 
 patient response and tolerability.</p><p>dose escalation in clinical studies in adult cml and ph+ all patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase cml) or 180 mg once daily (advanced phase cml or ph+ all) was allowed in patients who 
 did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dose.</p><p>
 the following dose escalations shown in table 2 are recommended in paediatric patients with ph+ 
 cml-cp who do not achieve a haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response at the recommended 
 time points, per current treatment guidelines, and who tolerate the treatment.</p></section><section><header>table 2: dose escalation for paediatric patients with ph+ cml-cp  dose (maximum dose per day)

 in clinical studies, myelosuppression was managed by dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of study therapy. platelet transfusion and red cell transfusion were used as appropriate. 
 haematopoietic growth factor has been used in patients with resistant myelosuppression. 
 guidelines for dose modifications in adults are summarised in table 3 and in paediatric patients with

 during complete haematologic response (chr), dasatinib should be interrupted, and may be 
 subsequently resumed at a reduced dose. temporary dose reductions for intermediate degrees of 
 cytopaenia and disease response should be implemented as needed.</p><p>
 for paediatric patients with ph+ all, no dose modification is recommended in cases of haematologic 
 grade 1 to 4 toxicities. if neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia result in delay of the next block of 
 treatment by more than 14 days, dasatinib should be interrupted and resumed at the same dose level 
 once the next block of treatment is started. if neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia persist and the 
 next block of treatment is delayed another 7 days, a bone marrow assessment should be performed to 
 assess cellularity and percentage of blasts. if marrow cellularity is &lt;10%, treatment with dasatinib 
 should be interrupted until anc &gt;500/μl (0.5 x 10
 9/l), at which time treatment may be resumed at full dose. if marrow cellularity is &gt;10%, resumption of treatment with dasatinib may be considered.</p><p>
 non-haematologic adverse reactions if a moderate, grade 2, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, treatment should be interrupted until the adverse reaction has resolved or returned to baseline. the same dose should be 
 resumed if this is the first occurrence and the dose should be reduced if this is a recurrent adverse 
 reaction. if a severe grade 3 or 4, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, 
 treatment must be withheld until the adverse reaction has resolved. thereafter, treatment can be 
 resumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the adverse reaction. for 
 patients with chronic phase cml who received 100 mg once daily, dose reduction to 80 mg once daily 
 with further reduction from 80 mg once daily to 50 mg once daily, if needed, is recommended. for 
 patients with advanced phase cml or ph+ all who received 140 mg once daily, dose reduction to 
 100 mg once daily with further reduction from 100 mg once daily to 50 mg once daily, if needed, is 
 recommended. in cml-cp paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, the dose 
 reduction recommendations for haematologic adverse reactions that are described above should be 
 followed. in ph+ all paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, if needed, one 
 level of dose reduction should be followed, according to the dose reduction recommendations for 
 haematologic adverse reactions that are described above.</p><p>
 7</p><p>pleural effusion if a pleural effusion is diagnosed, dasatinib should be interrupted until patient is examined, asymptomatic or has returned to baseline. if the episode does not improve within approximately one 
 week, a course of diuretics or corticosteroids or both concurrently should be considered (see sections 
 4.4 and 4.8). following resolution of the first episode, reintroduction of dasatinib at the same dose 
 level should be considered. following resolution of a subsequent episode, dasatinib at one dose level 
 reduction should be reintroduced. following resolution of a severe (grade 3 or 4) episode, treatment 
 can be resumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the adverse 
 reaction.</p><p>dose reduction for concomitant use of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors the concomitant use of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors and grapefruit juice with dasatinib accordpharma should be avoided (see section 4.5). if possible, an alternative concomitant medication with no or 
 minimalenzyme inhibition potential should be selected. if dasatinib accordpharma must be 
 administered with a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor, consider a dose decrease to: 
 • 40 mg daily for patients taking dasatinib accordpharma 140 mg tablet daily. • 20 mg daily for patients taking dasatinib accordpharma 100 mg tablet daily. • 20 mg daily for patients taking dasatinib accordpharma 70 mg tablet daily.</p><p>
 for patients taking dasatinib accordpharma 60 mg or 40 mg daily, consider interrupting the dose of 
 dasatinib accordpharma until the cyp3a4 inhibitor is discontinued, or switching to a lower dose 
 with the dasatinib powder for oral suspension formulation (see summary of product characteristics 
 for dasatinib powder for oral suspension). allow a washout period of approximately 1 week after the 
 inhibitor is stopped before reinitiating dasatinib accordpharma.</p><p>
 these reduced doses of dasatinib accordpharma are predicted to adjust the area under the curve 
 (auc) to the range observed without cyp3a4 inhibitors; however, clinical data are not available with 
 these dose adjustments in patients receiving strong cyp3a4 inhibitors. if dasatinib accordpharma is 
 not tolerated after dose reduction, either discontinue the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor or interrupt 
 dasatinib accordpharma until the inhibitor is discontinued. allow a washout period of approximately 
 1 week after the inhibitor is stopped before the dasatinib accordpharma dose is increased.</p><p>
 special populations 
 elderly no clinically relevant age-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in these patients. no specific dose recommendation is necessary in elderly.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. however, dasatinib accordpharma should be used with caution in patients with hepatic 
 impairment (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 renal impairment no clinical studies were conducted with dasatinib in patients with decreased renal function (the study in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml excluded patients with serum creatinine 
 concentration &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal range, and studies in patients with chronic phase 
 cml with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy excluded patients with serum creatinine 
 concentration &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range). since the renal clearance of dasatinib 
 and its metabolites is &lt;4%, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal 
 insufficiency.</p><p>
 method of administration 
 dasatinib accordpharma must be administered orally. 
 the film-coated tablets must not be crushed, cut or chewed in order to maintain dosing consistency 
 and minimise the risk of dermal exposure; they must be swallowed whole. film-coated tablets should 
 not be dispersed as the exposure in patients receiving a dispersed tablet is lower than in those 
 8</p><p>swallowing a whole tablet. dasatinib powder for oral suspension is also available for paediatric ph+ cml-cp and ph+ all patients, and adult cml-cp patients, who cannot swallow tablets. dasatinib 
 accordpharma can be taken with or without a meal and should be taken consistently either in the 
 morning or in the evening (see section 5.2). dasatinib accordpharma should not be taken with 
 grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>clinically relevant interactions dasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4. therefore, there is a 
 potential for interaction with other concomitantly administered medicinal products that are 
 metabolised primarily by or modulate the activity of cyp3a4 (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products or substances that potently inhibit cyp3a4 (e.g. 
 ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) 
 may increase exposure to dasatinib. therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of a 
 potent cyp3a4 inhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that induce cyp3a4 (e.g. dexamethasone, 
 phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing 
 hypericum perforatum,</p><p>also known as st. john&apos;s wort) may substantially reduce exposure to dasatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of 
 alternative medicinal products with less potential for cyp3a4 induction should be selected (see 
 section 4.5).</p><p>
 concomitant use of dasatinib and a cyp3a4 substrate may increase exposure to the cyp3a4 
 substrate. therefore, caution is warranted when dasatinib is coadministered with cyp3a4 substrates 
 of narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
 or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 the concomitant use of dasatinib and a histamine-2 (h
 2) antagonist (e.g. famotidine), proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), or aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide may reduce the exposure 
 to dasatinib. thus, h
 2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended and aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide products should be administered up to 2 hours prior to, or 2 hours 
 following the administration of dasatinib (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 special populations 
 based on the findings from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, patients with mild, moderate or 
 severe hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose (see section 5.2). due to the 
 limitations of this clinical study, caution is recommended when administering dasatinib to patients 
 with hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 important adverse reactions 
 myelosuppression treatment with dasatinib is associated with anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. their occurrence is earlier and more frequent in patients with advanced phase cml or ph+ all than in 
 chronic phase cml. in adult patients with advanced phase cml or ph+ all treated with dasatinib as 
 monotherapy, complete blood counts (cbcs) should be performed weekly for the first 2 months, and 
 then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. in adult and paediatric patients with chronic phase 
 cml, complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 3 months 
 thereafter or as clinically indicated. in paediatric patients with ph+ all treated with dasatinib in 
 combination with chemotherapy, cbcs should be performed prior to the start of each block of 
 chemotherapy and as clinically indicated. during the consolidation blocks of chemotherapy, cbcs 
 9</p><p>should be performed every 2 days until recovery (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). myelosuppression is generally reversible and usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or by dose reduction.</p><p>
 bleeding in patients with chronic phase cml (n=548), 5 patients (1%) receiving dasatinib had grade 3 or 4 haemorrhage. in clinical studies in patients with advanced phase cml receiving the recommended 
 dose of dasatinib (n=304), severe central nervous system (cns) haemorrhage occurred in 1% of 
 patients. one case was fatal and was associated with common toxicity criteria (ctc) grade 4 
 thrombocytopaenia. grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 6% of patients with 
 advanced phase cml and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. other 
 grade 3 or 4 haemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients with advanced phase cml. most bleeding related 
 adverse reactions in these patients were typically associated with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopaenia (see 
 section 4.8). additionally, 
 in vitro and in vivo platelet assays suggest that dasatinib treatment reversibly affects platelet activation.</p><p>
 caution should be exercised if patients are required to take medicinal products that inhibit platelet 
 function or anticoagulants.</p><p>
 fluid retention dasatinib is associated with fluid retention. in the phase iii clinical study in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml, grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 13 patients (5%) in the 
 dasatinib-treatment group and in 2 patients (1%) in the imatinib-treatment group after a minimum of 
 60 months follow-up (see section 4.8). in all dasatinib treated patients with chronic phase cml, severe 
 fluid retention occurred in 32 patients (6%) receiving dasatinib at the recommended dose (n=548). in 
 clinical studies in patients with advanced phase cml or ph+ all receiving dasatinib at the 
 recommended dose (n=304), grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including 
 grade 3 or 4 pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 7% and 1% of patients, respectively. in these 
 patients grade 3 or 4 pulmonary oedema and pulmonary hypertension were each reported in 1% of 
 patients.</p><p>
 patients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion such as dyspnoea or dry cough should 
 be evaluated by chest x-ray. grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion may require thoracocentesis and oxygen 
 therapy. fluid retention adverse reactions were typically managed by supportive care measures that 
 include diuretics and short courses of steroids (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). patients aged 65 years and 
 older are more likely than younger patients to experience pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, 
 pericardial effusion and congestive heart failure, and should be monitored closely.</p><p>
 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) pah (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been reported in association with dasatinib treatment (see section 4.8). in these cases, pah was reported 
 after initiation of dasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment.</p><p>
 patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to 
 initiating dasatinib therapy. an echocardiography should be performed at treatment initiation in every 
 patient presenting symptoms of cardiac disease and considered in patients with risk factors for cardiac 
 or pulmonary disease. patients who develop dyspnoea and fatigue after initiation of therapy should be 
 evaluated for common etiologies including pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, anaemia, or lung 
 infiltration. in accordance with recommendations for management of non-haematologic adverse 
 reactions (see section 4.2) the dose of dasatinib should be reduced or therapy interrupted during this 
 evaluation. if no explanation is found, or if there is no improvement with dose reduction or 
 interruption, the diagnosis of pah should be considered. the diagnostic approach should follow 
 standard practice guidelines. if pah is confirmed, dasatinib should be permanently discontinued. 
 follow up should be performed according to standard practice guidelines. improvements in 
 haemodynamic and clinical parameters have been observed in dasatinib-treated patients with pah 
 following cessation of dasatinib therapy.</p><p>
 10</p><p>qt prolongation in vitro</p><p>data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (qt interval) (see section 5.3). in 258 dasatinib-treated patients and 258 imatinib-treated patients with a 
 minimum of 60 months follow-up in the phase iii study in newly diagnosed chronic phase cml, 
 1 patient (&lt;1%) in each group had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. the median 
 changes in qtcf from baseline were 3.0 msec in dasatinib-treated patients compared to 8.2 msec in 
 imatinib-treated patients. one patient (&lt; 1%) in each group experienced a qtcf &gt; 500 msec. in 
 865 patients with leukaemia treated with dasatinib in phase ii clinical studies, the mean changes from 
 baseline in qtc interval using fridericia&apos;s method (qtcf) were 4-6 msec; the upper 95% confidence 
 intervals for all mean changes from baseline were &lt;7 msec (see section 4.8). 
 of the 2,182 patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received dasatinib in 
 clinical studies, 15 (1%) had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. twenty-one of these 
 patients (1%) experienced a qtcf &gt;500 msec.</p><p>
 dasatinib should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of 
 qtc. these include patients with hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, patients with congenital long 
 qt syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other medicinal products which 
 lead to qt prolongation, and cumulative high dose anthracycline therapy. hypokalaemia or 
 hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to dasatinib administration.</p><p>
 cardiac adverse reactions dasatinib was studied in a randomised clinical study of 519 patients with newly diagnosed cml in chronic phase which included patients with prior cardiac disease. the cardiac adverse reactions of 
 congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, palpitations, qt 
 prolongation and myocardial infarction (including fatal) were reported in patients taking dasatinib. 
 cardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with risk factors or a history of cardiac 
 disease. patients with risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes) or a history of cardiac 
 disease (e.g. prior percutaneous coronary intervention, documented coronary artery disease) should be 
 monitored carefully for clinical signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction such as chest 
 pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.</p><p>
 if these clinical signs or symptoms develop, physicians are advised to interrupt dasatinib 
 administration and consider the need for alternative cml-specific treatment. after resolution, a 
 functional assessment should be performed prior to resuming treatment with dasatinib. dasatinib may 
 be resumed at the original dose for mild/moderate adverse reactions (≤grade 2) and resumed at a dose 
 level reduction for severe adverse reactions (≥grade 3) (see section 4.2). patients continuing treatment 
 should be monitored periodically.</p><p>
 patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease were not included in the clinical 
 studies.</p><p>
 thrombotic microangiopathy (tma) bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (tma), including individual case reports for dasatinib (see section 4.8). if laboratory or clinical findings 
 associated with tma occur in a patient receiving dasatinib, treatment with dasatinib should be</p><p>

 adamts13-antibody determination, should be completed. if anti-adamts13-antibody is elevated

 hepatitis b reactivation reactivation of hepatitis b in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these patients received bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors. some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or 
 fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. 
 patients should be tested for hbv infection before initiating treatment with dasatinib. experts in liver 
 disease and in the treatment of hepatitis b should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients 
 with positive hepatitis b serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test 
 positive for hbv infection during treatment. carriers of hbv who require treatment with dasatinib 
 11</p><p>should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active hbv infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 effects on growth and development in paediatric patients in paediatric trials of dasatinib in imatinib-resistant/intolerant ph+ cml-cp paediatric patients and treatment-naive ph+ cml-cp paediatric patients after at least 2 years of treatment, treatment-related 
 adverse events associated with bone growth and development were reported in 6 (4.6%) patients, one 
 of which was severe in intensity (growth retardation grade 3). these 6 cases included cases of 
 epiphyses delayed fusion, osteopaenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia (see section 5.1). these 
 results are difficult to interpret in the context of chronic diseases such as cml, and require long-term 
 follow-up
 .</p><p>
 in paediatric trials of dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ph+ all paediatric patients after a maximum of 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events 
 associated with bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. this case was a 
 grade 1 osteopenia.</p><p>
 growth retardation has been observed in paediatric patients treated with dasatinib in clinical trials (see 
 section 4.8). monitoring of bone growth and development in paediatric patients is recommended.</p><p>

 lactose this medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate. patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
 medicinal product.</p><p>
 isopropyl alcohol this medicinal product contains isopropyl alcohol, as a residue of the manufacturing process.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>active substances that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations in vitro studies indicate that dasatinib is a cyp3a4 substrate. concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products or substances which potently inhibit cyp3a4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
 erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase exposure to 
 dasatinib. therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, systemic administration of a potent cyp3a4 
 inhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 at clinically relevant concentrations, binding of dasatinib to plasma proteins is approximately 96% on 
 the basis of 
 in vitro experiments. no studies have been performed to evaluate dasatinib interaction with other protein-bound medicinal products. the potential for displacement and its clinical relevance 
 are unknown.</p><p>
 active substances that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations 
 when dasatinib was administered following 8 daily evening administrations of 600 mg rifampicin, a 
 potent cyp3a4 inducer, the auc of dasatinib was decreased by 82%. other medicinal products that 
 induce cyp3a4 activity (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or herbal 
 preparations containing 
 hypericum perforatum, also known as st. john´s wort) may also increase metabolism and decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. therefore, concomitant use of potent 
 cyp3a4 inducers with dasatinib is not recommended. in patients in whom rifampicin or other 
 cyp3a4 inducers are indicated, alternative medicinal products with less enzyme induction potential 
 should be used. concomitant use of dexamethasone, a weak cyp3a4 inducer, with dasatinib is 
 allowed; dasatinib auc is predicted to decrease approximately 25% with concomitant use of 
 dexamethasone, which is not likely to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>
 histamine-2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors 12</p><p>long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by h2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (e.g. famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. in a single-dose study in healthy 
 subjects, the administration of famotidine 10 hours prior to a single dose of dasatinib reduced dasatinib 
 exposure by 61%. in a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 100-mg dose of 
 dasatinib 22 hours following a 4-day, 40-mg omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the auc of 
 dasatinib by 43% and the c
 max of dasatinib by 42%. the use of antacids should be considered in place of h
 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 antacids non-clinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is ph-dependent. in healthy subjects, the concomitant use of aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide antacids with dasatinib reduced the 
 auc of a single dose of dasatinib by 55% and the c
 max by 58%. however, when antacids were administered 2 hours prior to a single dose of dasatinib accord, no relevant changes in dasatinib 
 concentration or exposure were observed. thus, antacids may be administered up to 2 hours prior to or 
 2 hours following dasatinib (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 active substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by dasatinib 
 concomitant use of dasatinib and a cyp3a4 substrate may increase exposure to the cyp3a4 
 substrate. in a study in healthy subjects, a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib increased auc and c
 max exposure to simvastatin, a known cyp3a4 substrate, by 20 and 37% respectively. it cannot be excluded that the effect is larger after multiple doses of dasatinib. therefore, cyp3a4 substrates 
 known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, 
 bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) should be administered with caution in 
 patients receiving dasatinib (see section 4.4). 
 in vitro data indicate a potential risk for interaction with cyp2c8 substrates, such as glitazones.</p><p>

 pregnancy 
 based on human experience, dasatinib is suspected to cause congenital malformations including neural 
 tube defects, and harmful pharmacological effects on the foetus when administered during pregnancy. 
 studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
 dasatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
 treatment with dasatinib. if dasatinib is used during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the 
 potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 breast-feeding 
 there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of dasatinib in human or animal breast milk. 
 physico-chemical and available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data on dasatinib point to excretion in 
 breast milk and a risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. breast-feeding should be stopped 
 during treatment with dasatinib.</p><p>
 fertility 
 in animal studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected by treatment with dasatinib (see 
 section 5.3). physicians and other healthcare providers should counsel male patients of appropriate age

 bleeding bleeding drug-related adverse reactions, ranging from petechiae and epistaxis to grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage and cns bleeding, were reported in patients taking dasatinib (see section 
 4.4).</p><p>fluid retention miscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and pericardial effusion with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. in the 
 newly diagnosed chronic phase cml study after a minimum of 60 months follow-up, dasatinib-related 
 fluid retention adverse reactions included pleural effusion (28%), superficial oedema (14%), 
 pulmonary hypertension (5%), generalised oedema (4%), and pericardial effusion (4%). congestive 
 heart failure/cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary oedema were reported in &lt;2% of patients. 
 the cumulative rate of dasatinib-related pleural effusion (all grades) over time was 10% at 12 months, 
 14% at 24 months, 19% at 36 months, 24% at 48 months and 28% at 60 months. a total of 
 46 dasatinib-treated patients had recurrent pleural effusions. seventeen patients had 2 separate adverse 
 reactions, 6 had 3 adverse reactions, 18 had 4 to 8 adverse reactions and 5 had &gt;8 episodes of pleural 
 effusions. 
 the median time to first dasatinib-related grade 1 or 2 pleural effusion was 114 weeks (range: 
 4 to 299 weeks). less than 10% of patients with pleural effusion had severe (grade 3 or 4) 
 dasatinib-related pleural effusions. the median time to first occurrence of grade ≥3 dasatinib-related 
 pleural effusion was 175 weeks (range: 114 to 274 weeks). the median duration of dasatinib-related 
 pleural effusion (all grades) was 283 days (~40 weeks). 
 pleural effusion was usually reversible and managed by interrupting dasatinib treatment and using 
 diuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). among dasatinib-
 treated patients with drug-related pleural effusion (n=73), 45 (62%) had dose interruptions and 30 
 (41%) had dose reductions. additionally, 34 (47%) received diuretics, 23 (32%) received 
 corticosteroids, and 20 (27%) received both corticosteroids and diuretics. nine (12%) patients 
 underwent therapeutic thoracentesis. 
 six percent of dasatinib-treated patients discontinued treatment due to drug-related pleural effusion. 
 pleural effusion did not impair the ability of patients to obtain a response. among the dasatinib-treated 
 patients with pleural effusion, 96% achieved a cccyr, 82% achieved a mmr, and 50% achieved a 
 mr4.5 despite dose interruptions or dose adjustment. 
 see section 4.4 for further information on patients with chronic phase cml and advanced phase cml 
 or ph+ all.</p><p>
 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) pah (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been reported in association with dasatinib exposure. in these cases, pah was reported after initiation of 
 dasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment. patients with pah reported during 
 dasatinib treatment were often taking concomitant medicinal products or had co-morbidities in 
 addition to the underlying malignancy. improvements in haemodynamic and clinical parameters have 
 been observed in patients with pah following discontinuation of dasatinib.</p><p>
 17</p><p>qt prolongation in the phase iii study in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml, one patient (&lt;1%) of the dasatinib -treated patients had a qtcf &gt;500 msec after a minimum of 12 months follow-up (see 
 section 4.4). no additional patients were reported to have qtcf &gt;500 msec after a minimum of 
 60 months follow-up. 
 in 5 phase ii clinical studies in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, 
 repeated baseline and on-treatment ecgs were obtained at pre-specified time points and read centrally 
 for 865 patients receiving dasatinib 70 mg twice daily. qt interval was corrected for heart rate by 
 fridericia&apos;s method. at all post-dose time points on day 8, the mean changes from baseline in qtcf 
 interval were 4-6 msec, with associated upper 95% confidence intervals &lt;7 msec. of the 2,182 patients 
 with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received dasatinib in clinical studies, 15 
 (1%) had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. twenty-one patients (1%) experienced a 
 qtcf &gt;500 msec (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiac adverse reactions patients with risk factors or a history of cardiac disease should be monitored carefully for signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and should be evaluated and treated appropriately (see 
 section 4.4).</p><p>
 hepatitis b reactivation hepatitis b reactivation has been reported in association with bcr-abl tkis. some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see 
 section 4.4).</p><p>
 in the phase iii dose-optimisation study in patients with chronic phase cml with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior imatinib therapy (median duration of treatment of 30 months), the incidence of 
 pleural effusion and congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction was lower in patients treated with 
 dasatinib 100 mg once daily than in those treated with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily. 
 myelosuppression was also reported less frequently in the 100 mg once daily treatment group (see 
 laboratory test abnormalities below). the median duration of therapy in the 100 mg once daily group 
 was 37 months (range 1-91 months). cumulative rates of selected adverse reactions that were reported

 follow-up, the cumulative rates of neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and anaemia were 29%, 22% and 
 13%, respectively.</p><p>
 in dasatinib -treated patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml who experienced grade 3 or 4 
 myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief dose interruptions and/or reductions 
 and permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1.6% of patients after a minimum of 
 12 months follow-up. after a minimum of 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of permanent 
 discontinuation due to grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was 2.3%.</p><p>
 in patients with cml with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, cytopaenias 
 (thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, and anaemia) were a consistent finding. however, the occurrence 
 of cytopaenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease. the frequency of grade 3 and 4 
 haematological abnormalities is presented in table 8.</p></section><section><header>table 8: ctc grades 3/4 haematological laboratory abnormalities in clinical studies in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy</header><p>a</p></section><section><header>chronic phase (n= 165)</header><p>b</p></section><section><header>accelerated phase

 (13% vs. 13%).</p><p>
 in patients who experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following 
 brief dose interruptions and/or reductions and permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 5% 
 of patients. most patients continued treatment without further evidence of myelosuppression.</p><p>biochemistry in the newly diagnosed chronic phase cml study, grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was reported in 4% of dasatinib -treated patients, and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases, creatinine, and bilirubin 
 were reported in ≤1% of patients after a minimum of 12 months follow-up. after a minimum of 
 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was 7%, grade 3 or 4 
 elevations of creatinine and bilirubin was 1% and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases remained 
 20</p><p>1%. there were no discontinuations of dasatinib therapy due to these biochemical laboratory parameters.</p><p>2 year follow-up grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% of patients with chronic phase cml (resistant or intolerant to imatinib), but elevations were reported with an increased 
 frequency of 1 to 7% of patients with advanced phase cml and ph+ all. it was usually managed 
 with dose reduction or interruption. in the phase iii dose-optimisation study in chronic phase cml, 
 grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in ≤1% of patients with similar low 
 incidence in the four treatment groups. in the phase iii dose-optimisation study in advanced phase 
 cml and ph+all, grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% to 5% of 
 patients across treatment groups.</p><p>
 approximately 5% of the dasatinib -treated patients who had normal baseline levels experienced 
 grade 3 or 4 transient hypocalcaemia at some time during the course of the study. in general, there was 
 no association of decreased calcium with clinical symptoms. patients developing grade 3 or 4 
 hypocalcaemia often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation. 
 grade 3 or 4 hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, and hypophosphataemia were reported in patients with all 
 phases of cml but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid 
 blast phase cml and ph+ all. grade 3 or 4 elevations in creatinine were reported in &lt;1% of patients 
 with chronic phase cml and were reported with an increased frequency of 1 to 4% of patients with 
 advanced phase cml.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 the safety profile of dasatinib administered as single-agent therapy in paediatric patients with ph+ 
 cml-cp was comparable to the safety profile in adults. the safety profile of dasatinib administered in 
 combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients with ph+ all was consistent with the known 
 safety profile of dasatinib in adults and the expected effects of chemotherapy, with the exception of a 
 lower pleural effusion rate in paediatric patients as compared to adults.</p><p>
 in the paediatric cml studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known 
 profile for laboratory parameters in adults.</p><p>
 in the paediatric all studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known 
 profile for laboratory parameters in adults, within the context of an acute leukaemia patient receiving a 
 background chemotherapy regimen.</p><p>
 special population 
 while the safety profile of dasatinib in elderly was similar to that in the younger population, patients 
 aged 65 years and older are more likely to experience the commonly reported adverse reactions such 
 as fatigue, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and appetite 
 disturbance and more likely to experience less frequently reported adverse reactions such as abdominal 
 distention, dizziness, pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, and weight decrease and should be 
 monitored closely (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v

 significant decrease in platelet counts. since dasatinib is associated with grade 3 or 4 
 myelosuppression (see section 4.4), patients who ingest more than the recommended dose should be 
 closely monitored for myelosuppression and given appropriate supportive treatment

 pharmacodynamics</p><p>dasatinib inhibits the activity of the bcr-abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of 
 other selected oncogenic kinases including c-kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and pdgfβ 
 receptor. dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the bcr-abl kinase with potency at of 
 0.6-0.8 nm. it binds to both the inactive and active conformations of the bcr-abl enzyme.</p><p>
 mechanism of action 
 in vitro, dasatinib is active in leukaemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib-sensitive and resistant disease. these non-clinical studies show that dasatinib can overcome imatinib resistance 
 resulting from bcr-abl overexpression, bcr-abl kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate 
 signalling pathways involving the src family kinases (lyn, hck), and multidrug resistance gene 
 overexpression. additionally, dasatinib inhibits src family kinases at subnanomolar concentrations.</p><p>in vivo, in separate experiments using murine models of cml, dasatinib prevented the progression of chronic cml to blast phase and prolonged the survival of mice bearing patient-derived cml cell lines 
 grown at various sites, including the central nervous system.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety 
 in the phase i study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of cml and 
 in ph+ all in the first 84 patients treated and followed for up to 27 months. responses were durable 
 across all phases of cml and ph+ all.</p><p>
 four single-arm, uncontrolled, open-label phase ii clinical studies were conducted to determine the 
 safety and efficacy of dasatinib in patients with cml in chronic, accelerated, or myeloid blast phase, 
 who were either resistant or intolerant to imatinib. one randomised non-comparative study was 
 conducted in chronic phase patients who failed initial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. the 
 starting dose was 70 mg dasatinib twice daily. dose modifications were allowed for improving activity 
 or management of toxicity (see section 4.2). 
 two randomised, open-label phase iii studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib 
 administered once daily compared with dasatinib administered twice daily. in addition, one open-label, 
 randomised, comparative phase iii study was conducted in adult patients with newly diagnosed 
 chronic phase cml.</p><p>
 the efficacy of dasatinib is based on haematological and cytogenetic response rates. 
 durability of response and estimated survival rates provide additional evidence of dasatinib clinical 
 benefit.</p><p>
 a total of 2,712 patients were evaluated in clinical studies; of these 23% were ≥65 years of age and 
 5% were ≥75 years of age.</p><p>
 22</p><p>chronic phase cml - newly diagnosed an international open-label, multicentre, randomised, comparative phase iii study was conducted in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml. patients were randomised to receive either 
 dasatinib</p><p>100 mg once daily or imatinib 400 mg once daily. the primary endpoint was the rate of 
 confirmed complete cytogenetic response (cccyr) within 12 months. secondary endpoints included 
 time in cccyr (measure of durability of response), time to cccyr, major molecular response (mmr) 
 rate, time to mmr, progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os). other relevant efficacy 
 results included ccyr and complete molecular response (cmr) rates. the study is ongoing.</p><p>
 a total of 519 patients were randomised to a treatment group: 259 to dasatinib and 260 to imatinib. 
 baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups with respect to age 
 (median age was 46 years for dasatinib group and 49 years for the imatinib group with 10% and 11% 
 of patients 65 years of age or older, respectively), gender (women 44% and 37%, respectively), and 
 race (caucasian 51% and 55%; asian 42% and 37%, respectively). at baseline, the distribution of 
 hasford scores was similar in the dasatinib and imatinib treatment groups (low risk: 33% and 34%; 
 intermediate risk 48% and 47%; high risk: 19% and 19%, respectively).</p><p>
 with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 85% of patients randomised to the dasatinib group and 81% 
 of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. discontinuation 
 within 12 months due to disease progression occurred in 3% of dasatinib</p><p>treated patients and 5% of 
 imatinib-treated patients.</p><p>
 with a minimum of 60 months follow-up, 60% of patients randomised to the dasatinib</p><p>group and 63% 
 of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. 
 discontinuation within 60 months due to disease progression occurred in 11% of dasatinib treated 
 patients and 14% of imatinib-treated patients.</p><p>
 efficacy results are presented in table 9. a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in 
 the dasatinib group achieved a cccyr compared with patients in the imatinib group within the first 
 12 months of treatment. efficacy of dasatinib was consistently demonstrated across different 
 subgroups, including age, gender, and baseline hasford score.</p></section><section><header>table 9: efficacy results from a phase 3 study of newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase cml

 chronic phase cml - resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy two clinical studies were conducted in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib; the primary efficacy endpoint in these studies was major cytogenetic response (mcyr).</p><p>
 study 1 an open-label, randomised, non-comparative multicentre study was conducted in patients who failed initial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. they were randomised (2:1) to either dasatinib (70 mg 
 twice daily) or imatinib (400 mg twice daily). crossover to the alternative treatment arm was allowed 
 if patients showed evidence of disease progression or intolerance that could not be managed by dose 
 modification. the primary endpoint was mcyr at 12 weeks. results are available for 150 patients: 
 101 were randomised to dasatinib and 49 to imatinib (all imatinib-resistant). the median time from 
 diagnosis to randomisation was 64 months in the dasatinib group and 52 months in the imatinib group. 
 all patients were extensively pretreated. prior complete haematologic response (chr) to imatinib was 
 achieved in 93% of the overall patient population. a prior mcyr to imatinib was achieved in 28% and 
 29% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. 
 median duration of treatment was 23 months for dasatinib (with 44% of patients treated for 
 &gt;24 months to date) and 3 months for imatinib (with 10% of patients treated for &gt; 24 months to date). 
 27</p><p>ninety-three percent of patients in the dasatinib arm and 82% of patients in the imatinib arm achieved a chr prior to crossover.</p><p>
 at 3 months, a mcyr occurred more often in the dasatinib arm (36%) than in the imatinib arm (29%). 
 notably, 22% of patients reported a complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) in the dasatinib arm while 
 only 8% achieved a ccyr in the imatinib arm. with longer treatment and follow-up (median of 
 24 months), mcyr was achieved in 53% of the dasatinib-treated patients (ccyr in 44%) and 33% of 
 the imatinib-treated patients (ccyr in 18%) prior to crossover. among patients who had received 
 imatinib 400 mg prior to study entry, mcyr was achieved in 61% of patients in the dasatinib arm and 
 50% in the imatinib arm. 
 based on the kaplan-meier estimates, the proportion of patients who maintained mcyr for 1 year was 
 92% (95% ci: [85%-100%]) for dasatinib (ccyr 97%, 95% ci: [92%-100%]) and 74% (95% ci:

 (95% ci: [49%-100%]) for imatinib (ccyr 100%).</p><p>
 based on the kaplan-meier estimates, the proportion of patients who had progression-free survival 
 (pfs) for 1 year was 91% (95% ci: [85%-97%]) for dasatinib and 73% (95% ci: [54%-91%]) for 
 imatinib. the proportion of patients who had pfs at 2 years was 86% (95% ci: [78%-93%]) for 
 dasatinib and 65% (95% ci: [43%-87%]) for imatinib.</p><p>
 a total of 43% of the patients in the dasatinib arm, and 82% in the imatinib arm had treatment failure,

 the rate of major molecular response (defined as bcr-abl/control transcripts ≤0.1% by rq-pcr in 
 peripheral blood samples) prior to crossover was 29% for dasatinib and 12% for imatinib.</p><p>study 2 an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib (i.e. patients who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that 
 precluded further treatment). 
 a total of 387 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (288 resistant and 99 intolerant). the 
 median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 61 months. the majority of the patients (53%) 
 had received prior imatinib treatment for more than 3 years. most resistant patients (72%) had received 
 &gt; 600 mg imatinib. in addition to imatinib, 35% of patients had received prior cytotoxic 
 chemotherapy, 65% had received prior interferon, and 10% had received a prior stem cell transplant. 
 thirty-eight percent of patients had baseline mutations known to confer imatinib resistance. median 
 duration of treatment on dasatinib was 24 months with 51% of patients treated for &gt;24 months to date. 
 efficacy results are reported in table 11. mcyr was achieved in 55% of imatinib-resistant patients 
 and 82% of imatinib-intolerant patients. with a minimum of 24 months follow-up, 21 of the 
 240 patients who had achieved a mcyr had progressed and the median duration of mcyr had not 
 been reached.</p><p>
 based on the kaplan-meier estimates, 95% (95% ci: [92%-98%]) of the patients maintained mcyr 
 for 1 year and 88% (95% ci: [83%-93%]) maintained mcyr for 2 years. the proportion of patients 
 who maintained ccyr for 1 year was 97% (95% ci: [94%-99%]) and for 2 years was 90% (95% ci: 
 [86%-95%]). forty-two percent of the imatinib-resistant patients with no prior mcyr to imatinib 
 (n= 188) achieved a mcyr with dasatinib. 
 there were 45 different bcr-abl mutations in 38% of patients enrolled in this study. complete 
 haematologic response or mcyr was achieved in patients harbouring a variety of bcr-abl 
 mutations associated with imatinib resistance except t315i. the rates of mcyr at 2 years were similar 
 whether patients had any baseline bcr-abl mutation, p-loop mutation, or no mutation (63%, 61% 
 and 62%, respectively).</p><p>
 28</p><p>among imatinib-resistant patients, the estimated rate of pfs was 88% (95% ci: [84%-92%]) at 1 year and 75% (95% ci: [69%-81%]) at 2 years. among imatinib-intolerant patients, the estimated rate of 
 pfs was 98% (95% ci: [95%-100%]) at 1 year and 94% (95% ci: [88%-99%]) at 2 years.</p><p>
 the rate of major molecular response at 24 months was 45% (35% for imatinib-resistant patients and 
 74% for imatinib-intolerant patients).</p><p>
 accelerated phase cml an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib. a total of 174 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (161 resistant and 13 intolerant 
 to imatinib). the median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 82 months. median duration of 
 treatment on dasatinib was 14 months with 31% of patients treated for &gt; 24 months to date. the rate of 
 major molecular response (assessed in 41 patients with a ccyr) was 46% at 24 months. further 
 efficacy results are reported in table 11.</p><p>
 myeloid blast phase cml an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib. a total of 109 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (99 resistant and 10 intolerant to 
 imatinib). the median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 48 months. median duration of 
 treatment on dasatinib was 3.5 months with 12% of patients treated for &gt;24 months to date. the rate of 
 major molecular response (assessed in 19 patients with a ccyr) was 68% at 24 months. further 
 efficacy results are reported in table 11.</p><p>
 lymphoid blast phase cml and ph+ all an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients with lymphoid blast phase cml or ph+ all who were resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy. a total of 48 patients with 
 lymphoid blast cml received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (42 resistant and 6 intolerant to imatinib). 
 the median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 28 months. median duration of treatment on 
 dasatinib was 3 months with 2% treated for &gt;24 months to date. the rate of major molecular response 
 (all 22 treated patients with a ccyr) was 50% at 24 months. in addition, 46 patients with ph+ all 
 received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (44 resistant and 2 intolerant to imatinib). the median time from 
 diagnosis to start of treatment was 18 months. median duration of treatment on dasatinib was 3 months 
 with 7% of patients treated for &gt;24 months to date. the rate of major molecular response (all 
 25 treated patients with a ccyr) was 52% at 24 months. further efficacy results are reported in table 
 11. of note, major haematologic responses (mahr) were achieved quickly (most within 35 days of 
 first dasatinib administration for patients with lymphoid blast cml, and within 55 days for patients 
 with ph+ all).</p></section><section><header>table 11: efficacy in phase ii dasatinib single-arm clinical studies</header><p>a</p></section><section><header>chronic (n= 387)

 phase iii clinical studies in patients with cml in chronic, accelerated, or myeloid blast phase, and ph+ all who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib</p><p>two randomised, open-label studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib administered once daily compared with dasatinib administered twice daily. results described below are based on a 
 minimum of 2 years and 7 years follow-up after the start of dasatinib therapy.</p><p>
 study 1 in the study in chronic phase cml, the primary endpoint was mcyr in imatinib-resistant patients. the main secondary endpoint was mcyr by total daily dose level in the imatinib-resistant patients. 
 other secondary endpoints included duration of mcyr, pfs, and overall survival. a total of 
 670 patients, of whom 497 were imatinib-resistant, were randomised to the dasatinib 100 mg once 
 daily, 140 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, or 70 mg twice daily group. the median duration of 
 treatment for all patients still on therapy with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up (n=205) was 
 59 months (range 28-66 months). median duration of treatment for all patients at 7 years of follow-up 
 was 29.8 months (range &lt;1-92.9 months).</p><p>
 efficacy was achieved across all dasatinib treatment groups with the once daily schedule 
 demonstrating comparable efficacy (non-inferiority) to the twice daily schedule on the primary 
 efficacy endpoint (difference in mcyr 1.9%; 95% confidence interval [-6.8%-10.6%]); however, the 
 100 mg once daily regimen demonstrated improved safety and tolerability. efficacy results are

 induction and consolidation as measured by flow cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients.</p><p>
 absorption 
 dasatinib is rapidly absorbed in patients following oral administration, with peak concentrations 
 between 0.5-3 hours. following oral administration, the increase in the mean exposure (aucτ) is 
 approximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg twice 
 daily. the overall mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is approximately 5-6 hours in patients.</p><p>
 data from healthy subjects administered a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following a 
 high-fat meal indicated a 14% increase in the mean auc of dasatinib. a low-fat meal 30 minutes prior 
 to dasatinib resulted in a 21% increase in the mean auc of dasatinib. the observed food effects do not 
 represent clinically relevant changes in exposure. dasatinib exposure variability is higher under fasted 
 conditions (47% cv) compared to light-fat meal (39% cv) and high-fat meal (32% cv) conditions.</p><p>
 based on the patient population pk analysis, variability in dasatinib exposure was estimated to be 
 mainly due to inter-occasion variability in bioavailability (44% cv) and, to a lesser extent, due to 
 inter-individual variability in bioavailability and inter-individual variability in clearance (30% and 
 32% cv, respectively). the random inter-occasion variability in exposure is not expected to affect the 
 cumulative exposure and efficacy or safety</p><p>
 distribution 
 in patients, dasatinib has a large apparent volume of distribution (2,505 l), coefficient of variation 
 (cv% 93%), suggesting that the medicinal product is extensively distributed in the extravascular 
 space. at clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 
 96% on the basis of 
 in vitro experiments.</p><p>
 biotransformation 
 dasatinib is extensively metabolised in humans with multiple enzymes involved in the generation of 
 the metabolites. in healthy subjects administered 100 mg of [
 14c]-labelled dasatinib, unchanged dasatinib represented 29% of circulating radioactivity in plasma. plasma concentration and measured 
 in vitro activity indicate that metabolites of dasatinib are unlikely to play a major role in the observed 
 pharmacology of the product. cyp3a4 is a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dasatinib.</p><p>
 elimination 
 the mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is 3 hours to 5 hours. the mean apparent oral clearance is 
 363.8 l/hr (cv% 81.3%).</p><p>
 elimination is predominantly in the faeces, mostly as metabolites. following a single oral dose of 
 [
 14c]-labelled dasatinib, approximately 89% of the dose was eliminated within 10 days, with 4% and 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. unchanged dasatinib 
 34</p><p>accounted for 0.1% and 19% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, with the remainder of the dose as metabolites.</p><p>
 hepatic and renal impairment 
 the effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of dasatinib was assessed in 8 
 moderately hepatic-impaired subjects who received a 50 mg dose and 5 severely hepatic-impaired 
 subjects who received a 20 mg dose compared to matched healthy subjects who received a 70 mg dose 
 of dasatinib. the mean c
 max and auc of dasatinib adjusted for the 70 mg dose were decreased by 47% and 8%, respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal 
 hepatic function. in severely hepatic-impaired subjects, the mean c
 max and auc adjusted for the 70 mg dose were decreased by 43% and 28%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic 
 function (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p>
 dasatinib and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib have been evaluated in 104 paediatric patients with leukaemia or 
 solid tumours (72 who received the tablet formulation and 32 who received the dasatinib powder for 
 oral suspension).</p><p>
 in a paediatric pharmacokinetics study, dose-normalized dasatinib exposure (cavg, c
 min and cmax) appears similar between 21 patients with cp-cml and 16 patients with ph+ all.</p><p>
 pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of dasatinib were evaluated for 72 paediatric patients with 
 relapsed or refractory leukaemia or solid tumours at oral doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/m
 2 once daily and 50 to 110 mg/m
 2 twice daily. data was pooled across two studies and showed that dasatinib was rapidly absorbed. mean t
 max was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours and mean half-life ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. dasatinib pk showed dose proportionality 
 with a dose-related increase in exposure observed in paediatric patients. there was no significant 
 difference of dasatinib pk between children and adolescents. the geometric means of dosenormalized 
 dasatinib c
 max, auc (0-t), and auc (inf) appeared to be similar between children and adolescents at different dose levels. a ppk model-based simulation predicted that the body weight tiered dosing 
 recommendation described for the tablet, in section 4.2, is expected to provide similar exposure to a 
 tablet dose of 60 mg/m
 2. these data should be considered if patients are to switch from tablets to dasatinib powder for oral suspension or vice versa.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>the non-clinical safety profile of dasatinib was assessed in a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies in mice, rats, monkeys, and rabbits.</p><p>
 the primary toxicities occurred in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, and lymphoid systems. 
 gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in rats and monkeys, as the intestine was a consistent target 
 organ. in rats, minimal to mild decreases in erythrocyte parameters were accompanied by bone 
 marrow changes; similar changes occurred in monkeys at a lower incidence. lymphoid toxicity in rats 
 consisted of lymphoid depletion of the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, and decreased lymphoid 
 organ weights. changes in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were reversible 
 following cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 renal changes in monkeys treated for up to 9 months were limited to an increase in background kidney 
 mineralisation. cutaneous haemorrhage was observed in an acute, single-dose oral study in monkeys 
 but was not observed in repeat-dose studies in either monkeys or rats. in rats, dasatinib inhibited 
 platelet aggregation 
 in vitro and prolonged cuticle bleeding time in vivo, but did not invoke spontaneous haemorrhage.</p><p>
 35</p><p>dasatinib activity in vitro in herg and purkinje fiber assays suggested a potential for prolongation of cardiac ventricular repolarisation (qt interval). however, in an 
 in vivo single-dose study in conscious telemetered monkeys, there were no changes in qt interval or ecg wave form.</p><p>
 dasatinib was not mutagenic in 
 in vitro bacterial cell assays (ames test) and was not genotoxic in an in vivo rat micronucleus study. dasatinib was clastogenic in vitro to dividing chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells.</p><p>
 dasatinib did not affect male or female fertility in a conventional rat fertility and early embryonic 
 development study, but induced embryolethality at dose levels approximating human clinical 
 exposures. in embryofoetal development studies, dasatinib likewise induced embryolethality with 
 associated decreases in litter size in rats, as well as foetal skeletal alterations in both rats and rabbits. 
 these effects occurred at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity, indicating that dasatinib is a 
 selective reproductive toxicant from implantation through the completion of organogenesis.</p><p>
 in mice, dasatinib induced immunosuppression, which was dose-related and effectively managed by 
 dose reduction and/or changes in dosing schedule. dasatinib had phototoxic potential in an 
 in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in mouse fibroblasts. dasatinib was considered to be non-phototoxic 
 in vivo after a single oral administration to female hairless mice at exposures up to 3-fold the human exposure following administration of the recommended therapeutic dose (based on 
 auc).</p><p>
 in a two-year carcinogenicity study, rats were administered oral doses of dasatinib at 0.3, 1, and 
 3 mg/kg/day. the highest dose resulted in a plasma exposure (auc) level generally equivalent to the 
 human exposure at the recommended range of starting doses from 100 mg to 140 mg daily. a 
 statistically significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous cell carcinomas and 
 papillomas in the uterus and cervix of high-dose females and of prostate adenoma in low-dose males 
 was noted. the relevance of the findings from the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>tablet core lactose monohydrate

 the growth of these leukaemic cells.</p><p>
 dasatinib accordpharma is also used to treat philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute 
 lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) in adults, adolescents and children at least 1 year of age, and 
 lymphoid blast cml in adults who are not benefiting from prior therapies. in people with all, white 
 cells called lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live too long. dasatinib accordpharma inhibits the
