 grounds for the comp opinion</header><p>the comp opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2000 was based on the following grounds: 
 • acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as“ the condition”) was estimated to affect not more than 0.66 in 10,000 persons in the community when the submission was made; 
 • the condition is life-threatening: disease-free survival at 7 years is about 40-50% in younger patients. the prognosis is worse for older patients; 
 • although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the community, justifications have been provided that gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be of significant 
 benefit to those affected by the condition.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.

 application is made 
 condition</header><p>the comp continues to accept the condition for orphan designation. acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is a disease characterised by rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of malignant clonal haematopoietic stem 
 cells that accumulate as immature, undifferentiated cells (blasts) and lead to impaired production of 
 normal haematopoietic elements, which in turn leads to anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 
 the approved therapeutic indication “mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin 
 (dnr) and cytarabine (arac) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously 
 untreated, 
 de novo cd33 positive acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl)” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of acute 
 myeloid leukaemia”.</p></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat</header><p>the medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the chmp.</p></section><section><header>chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature</header><p>the condition has been presented to be life threatening with a 5-year survival rate of patients of 23% in patients below 55 years of age and 11% for patients above 55 years of age. it is also described that 
 improved survival in the elderly has not substantially changed in the recent years.</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 3.86% (range: 3.27%, 4.52%)</p><p>
 the comp concluded the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
 consequences of bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic 
 episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. the condition 
 progresses rapidly and is fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated. the overall 5-
 year relative survival with the currently available treatments is approximately 22%.</p></section><section><header>number of people affected or at risk</header><p>a systematic literature search was conducted to identify epidemiological literature sources. national and pan european registry data were presented from the following sources: swedish aml registry, 
 nordcan, haematological malignancy research network (uk), rarecare, hamecare. the reported 
 prevalence was in a range of 0.9 per 10,000 population to 1.5 per 10,000 population (table 2). the 
 project surveillance of rare cancers in europe (rarecare) project reported a prevalence of 1.1 per 
 10,000. this prevalence figure was considered to be most relevant, because it is based on data 
 collected in 89 population based cancer registries in 21 european countries.</p><p>
 in addition, a sensitivity analysis was presented taking into consideration the most conservative 
 assumptions. this analysis concluded on a maximum prevalence of 2.5 per 10,000 at the time of 
 application submission in 2017. this figure was estimated by combining the highest reported 
 prevalence figure in europe of 2015 (1.5 per 1,000) with the highest reported incidence figure (0.5 per 
 10,000) for years 2016 and 2017. this prevalence estimate could represent an overestimate, but was 
 acknowledged as supportive evidence.</p><p>
 the comp accepted a prevalence calculation of approximately 1 per 10,000, based on the reported 15 
 year prevalence from rarecare.</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 those affected by the condition. 
 existing methods</header><p>the following products can be identified to be authorised for the treatment of the orphan condition: histamine dihydrochloride, decitabine, azacitidine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 
 cytarabine (ara-c), thioguanine, l-asparaginase, doxorubicin, vincristine sulphate, cyclophosphamide.</p><p>
 most recently rydapt (midostaurin) has been authorised in combination with standard daunorubicin 
 and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in 
 complete response followed by rydapt single agent maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly 
 diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) who are flt3 mutation positive.</p><p>
 the comp also takes into consideration the current european society for medical oncology (esmo) 
 treatment guideline from fey and buske 2013 discussing the current treatment options for aml in 
 adult patients (ann oncol 2013; 24 (suppl 6): vi138-vi143).</p></section><section><header>significant benefit</header><p>significant benefit needs to be demonstrated in adult patients with previously untreated, de novo acute myeloid leukaemia. in this context the esmo guideline outlines that for intensive treatment of non-apl 
 aml induction should include an anthracycline (daunorubicin) and cytarabine (ara-c) with the 
 particularly well-known and time-honoured ‘3+7’ regimen. furthermore, consolidation therapy in aml 
 is warranted once patients have reached clinical and haematological remission. taken into 
 consideration the esmo guideline and the authorisation status of medicinal products, it was considered 
 that significant benefit would need to be established versus standard induction chemotherapy 
 consisting of anthracyclines and cytarabine, and midosturin. a demonstration of significant benefit over 
 first line therapies in non-intensive treatments and treatments authorised in the relapsed/refractory 
 setting were not deemed necessary.</p><p>
 significant benefit versus midostaurin (rydapt) is argued on a clinically relevant advantage in patients, 
 who are not flt3 mutation positive. mylotarg aims to treat naïve patients on top of standard induction 
 chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. midostaurin is indicated for the same line of 
 treatment, but the indication of midostaurin is restricted to patients with flt3 mutations. mylotarg can 
 be used for the treatment of all patients independent of flt3 mutation status and the comp 
 considered that this represents a clinically relevant advantage. 
 significant benefit versus the induction therapy anthracycline (daunorubicin) and cytarabine (ara-c) 
 was supported by the clinical trial alfa0701 trial. this trial that was assessed as pivotal evidence by 
 the chmp (please also refer to the epar of mylotarg). the alfa0701 trial was an open-label, 
 randomised controlled phase 3 study comparing fractioned low dose mylotarg in addition to induction 
 and consolidation chemotherapy in patients with de novo untreated aml age 50-70 years. the 
 treatment algorithm was according to clinical practise consisting of the well-known and authorised</p><p>
 ‘3+7’ induction chemotherapy (dnr 60 mg/m
 2/day</p><p>and arac 200 mg/m2/day with or without mylotarg 3 mg/m
 2/day at days 1, 3 and 7; max 5mg per dose and day). primary endpoint was event-free survival (efs), defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of induction failure, relapse, or 
 death due to any cause, whichever came first, determined by each investigator individually and</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/164384/2018</p><p>
 page 8/11</p><p>
 according to guideline recommendations. follow-up therapies, which could potentially impact efs analysis, were equally balanced between arms. 
 a total of 271 patients were included as recruited, randomised and assigned treatment (136 to control, 
 135 to mylotarg arm) across 26 sites in france, forming the modified intention to treat (mitt) analysis 
 (excluding the 9 patients without informed consent found). the primary efficacy analysis, investigators 
 review and data cut of august 2011 showed an efs difference of 7.8 months (hazard ratio [hr] 0.562; 
 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.415-0.762; 2-sided p = 0.0002), corresponding to a 44% reduction in 
 the risk of an event for patients in the mylotarg arm (table 3). the robustness of the efs was 
 confirmed by appropriate additional sensitivity analyses. subgroup analyses of efs indicated a more 
 encouraging treatment effect with the mylotarg combination in patients with favourable/intermediate 
 risk cytogenetics (hr 0.591; 95% ci (0.407, 0.857), p = 0.0047; vs unfavourable hr 1.08).</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 regarding the secondary endpoints, relapse-free survival (rfs) confirmed a statistical significant 
 difference in favour of the mylotarg arm (hr 0.656, 95% ci [0.466, 0.922], p = 0.02480). response 
 rate, including early response (cr/crp at day 15 as part of a post hoc analyses) and overall survival 
 (os) did not show any statistically significant difference. survival data are available up to april 20130 
 and can be considered mature.</p><p>
 in addition to the alfa0701 trial data, an individual patient data (ipd) meta-analysis from 5 
 randomised investigator-initiated research (iir) studies, including the pivotal study alfa-0701, was 
 provided. the primary endpoint os was significantly improved in patients randomised to mylotarg than</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/164384/2018</p><p>
 page 10/11</p><p>
 in no-mylotarg patients. the or for mylotarg versus no-mylotarg was 0.91 (95% ci: 0.84-0.99, p = 0.02), in favour of the mylotarg arm. overall pooled median os was 23.62 months (95% ci: 21.22-
 27.33) in the mylotarg arm and 21.49 months (95% ci: 19.42-23.20) in the no-mylotarg arm. 
 taking into consideration the clinical data submitted to the comp and the chmp assessment of the 
 benefit-risk, the comp established significant benefit of mylotarg based on a clinically relevant 
 advantage as add-on therapy to standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin.</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 comp position adopted on 27 february 2018</header><p>the comp concluded that:</p><p>• the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the designated orphan medicinal product; 
 • the prevalence of acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be approximately 1 in 10,000 
 persons in the european union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
 • the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
 intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. the condition progresses rapidly and is 
 fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated. the overall 5-year relative survival 
 with the currently available treatments is approximately 22%; 
 • although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, mylotarg is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition. the committee 
 concluded that mylotarg offers a clinically relevant advantage for the treatment of adult patients 
 with previously untreated, de novo acute myeloid leukaemia. it was demonstrated that the 
 addition of mylotarg to authorised induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine led to 
 improved event-free survival when compared to standard chemotherapy alone. in addition, 
 mylotarg has significant benefit over midostaurin (rydapt), because it can be used in combination 
 with induction therapy in all treatment-naïve patients, independent of their flt3 mutation status.</p><p>
 the comp, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of article 
 5(12)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
 • the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; • the criteria for designation as set out in article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. the committee for orphan medicinal products has recommended that mylotarg, gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin, eu/3/00/005 for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia is not removed from the 
 community register of orphan medicinal products.</p></section></body></xml>
