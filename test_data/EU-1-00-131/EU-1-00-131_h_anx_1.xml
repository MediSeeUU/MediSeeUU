 each vial provides 50 micrograms/0.5 ml of peginterferon alfa-2b when reconstituted as recommended.</p><p>for excipients, see 6.1.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. pharmaceutical form</header><p>powder and solvent for solution for injection</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical particulars</header></section><section><header n="4.1">4.1 therapeutic indications</header><p>pegintron is indicated in monotherapy in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis c who have serum markers for 
 virus c replication, e.g. those who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who 
 are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv.</p><p>
 the optimal treatment for chronic hepatitis c is considered to be the administration of a combination 
 of interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. 
 the safety and efficacy of the combination of pegintron and ribavirin has not yet been documented.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>pegintron treatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with hepatitis c.</p><p>
 pegintron monotherapy is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once 
 weekly for at least 6 months. the dose should be selected based on the anticipated efficacy and safety 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1</header><p>). in patients showing loss of hcv-rna at 6 months, treatment is continued for an additional 6 months, i.e.1 year of treatment.</p><p>
 if adverse events develop during the course of treatment, it is recommended that the dose of pegintron 
 be modified to one-half the starting dose once weekly. if persistent or recurrent intolerance develops 
 following dose adjustment, discontinue treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 dose reduction is recommended if the neutrophil count is &lt; 0.75 x 10
 9/l or if the platelet count is &lt; 50,000 x 10
 9/l. discontinuation of treatment is recommended if the neutrophil count is &lt; 0.50 x 109/l or if the platelet count is &lt; 25,000 x 10
 9/l.</p></section><section><header>use in renal impairment</header><p>: the clearance of pegintron is reduced in patients with significant renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 ≤ 50 ml/minute) (see</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2</header><p>). it is recommended that these patients be closely monitored and that their weekly dose of pegintron be reduced if medically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>use in hepatic impairment</header><p>: the safety and efficacy of pegintron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore pegintron must not be used for these patients.</p></section><section><header>use in the elderly (</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age)</header><p>: there are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of pegintron. data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of pegintron suggest no alteration in 
 pegintron dose is necessary based on age (see</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>use in patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: pegintron is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under the age of 18, as there is no experience in this group.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; 
 -</p><p>hypersensitivity to any interferon; 
 -</p><p>autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease; 
 -</p><p>pre-existing severe psychiatric condition or a history of severe psychiatric disorder; 
 -</p><p>pre-existing thyroid abnormalities for which thyroid function cannot be maintained in the normal 
 range by medication; 
 -</p><p>severe renal or hepatic dysfunction;</p><p>-</p><p>epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (cns) function; 
 -</p><p>pregnancy.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use 
  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p></section><section><header>debilitating medical conditions</header><p>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been defined. 
 these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon alpha when 
 shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored 
 closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this has been reported more often in 
 patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration 
 and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may occur 
 more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders.</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons. any 
 patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. because these 
 ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to initiation of 
 pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable baseline 
 values that may be considered as a guideline are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level must be within normal limits</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p> there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. pegintron should not be used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>
 pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment period.</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue treatment or discontinue nursing, taking 
 into account the importance of the treatment to the mother.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>based on a clinical database of 940 pegintron treated patients of whom 754 received 0.5 to 1.5 microgram/kg for a year, most undesirable effects were mild or moderate in severity and not

 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trial results</header><p>the safety and efficacy of 48 weeks of treatment with 3 doses of pegintron (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 micrograms/kg administered subcutaneously once weekly) vs. introna (3 million iu administered

 in general, most side effects were dose-related, and the quality of life was less affected 
 by 0.5 microgram/kg of pegintron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of pegintron once weekly 
 or 3 miu of introna three times a week (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half life of pegintron is 
 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, cmax, auc, and half life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to 4 weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, sucrose and polysorbate 80

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p></section><section><header>debilitating medical conditions</header><p>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been defined. 
 these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon alpha when 
 shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored 
 closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this has been reported more often in 
 patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration 
 and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may occur 
 more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders.</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons. any 
 patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. because these 
 ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to initiation of 
 pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable baseline 
 values that may be considered as a guideline are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level must be within normal limits</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the

 in general, most side effects were dose-related, and the quality of life was less affected 
 by 0.5 microgram/kg of pegintron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of pegintron once weekly

 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, cmax, auc, and half life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to 4 weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p></section><section><header>debilitating medical conditions</header><p>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been defined. 
 these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon alpha when 
 shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored 
 closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this has been reported more often in 
 patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration 
 and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may occur 
 more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders.</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons. any 
 patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. because these 
 ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to initiation of 
 pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable baseline

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the

 in general, most side effects were dose-related, and the quality of life was less affected 
 by 0.5 microgram/kg of pegintron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of pegintron once weekly

 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, cmax, auc, and half life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to 4 weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.</p><p>

 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p></section><section><header>debilitating medical conditions</header><p>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been defined. 
 these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon alpha when 
 shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored 
 closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this has been reported more often in 
 patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration 
 and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may occur 
 more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders.</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons. any 
 patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. because these 
 ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to initiation of 
 pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable baseline

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the

 in general, most side effects were dose-related, and the quality of life was less affected 
 by 0.5 microgram/kg of pegintron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of pegintron once weekly 
 or 3 miu of introna three times a week (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half life of pegintron is 
 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, cmax, auc, and half life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to 4 weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p></section><section><header>debilitating medical conditions</header><p>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been defined. 
 these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon alpha when 
 shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored 
 closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this has been reported more often in 
 patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration 
 and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may occur 
 more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders.</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons. any 
 patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. because these 
 ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to initiation of 
 pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable baseline 
 values that may be considered as a guideline are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level must be within normal limits</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the

 in general, most side effects were dose-related, and the quality of life was less affected 
 by 0.5 microgram/kg of pegintron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of pegintron once weekly 
 or 3 miu of introna three times a week (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half life of pegintron is 
 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, cmax, auc, and half life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to 4 weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from
