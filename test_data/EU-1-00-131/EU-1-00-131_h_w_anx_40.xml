 with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 c:</p><p>3 morning, 3 evening</p><p>d: 3 morning, 4 evening</p><p>duration of treatment – naïve patients predictability of sustained virological response:</p><p>patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve undetectable hcv-rna or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 or 12 are 
 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 4 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response</p><p>(i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>
 - 
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older :</p><p>
 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24. 
 • genotype 2 or 3:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. it is recommended that children and 
 adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if 
 their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.</p><p> pegintron monotherapy – adults 
 as monotherapy the pegintron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 
 μg/kg/week. the lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 
 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by

 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-
 29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available for 
 the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 9 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain.</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in 
 some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are 
 generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have 
 occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 10 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 11 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 12</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> 
 methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be

 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %),

 §class effect of interferon-alfa containing products – reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric patients; with pegintron reported in adult patients.</p><p>most of the changes in laboratory values in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or moderate. decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin 
 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p><p>

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 21 - pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.</p><p>among 480 patients with &gt; 2 log viral 
 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential

 .</p><p>28</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 29 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 c:</p><p>3 morning, 3 evening</p><p>d: 3 morning, 4 evening</p><p>duration of treatment – naïve patients predictability of sustained virological response:</p><p>patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve undetectable hcv-rna or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 or 12 are 
 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 34 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response</p><p>(i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1).

 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.

 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-
 29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available for 
 the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbati of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 39 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 40 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 41 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 42</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicinesmetabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>adults the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue,

 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse

 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p><p>

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 51 - pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.</p><p>among 480 patients with &gt; 2 log viral

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin

 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential

 .</p><p>58</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 59 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 64 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>

 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24. 
 • genotype 2 or 3:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. it is recommended that children and 
 adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if 
 their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.</p><p>pegintron monotherapy – adults 
 as monotherapy the pegintron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 
 μg/kg/week. the lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 
 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by 
 volume as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. for the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or 65 alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. pegintron monotherapy was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>table 2  monotherapy dosing

 • special populations</p><p>
 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 69 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 70 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 71 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 72</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant

 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3

 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).

 -

 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two 
 pegintron/ribavirin regimens [pegintron 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in 
 combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and peginterferon alfa-
 2a 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily (in two divided 
 doses) in 3,070 treatment-naïve adults with chronic hepatitis c genotype 1. response to the treatment

 * (hcv-rna pcr assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 iu/ml) lack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable hcv-rna with a &lt; 2 log
 10 reduction from baseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>
 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or 
 undetectable levels of hcv-rna. these time points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12)</p><p>have

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.</p><p>among 480 patients with &gt; 2 log viral

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin

 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential

 .</p><p>88</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 89 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 94 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.

 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non

 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60

 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 
 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log

 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-
 29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available for 
 the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 99 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 100 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 101 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 102</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3). 
 103</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>

 *these adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy.</p><p>most cases of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in combination 
 with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, 
 loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons

 107 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm

 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), 
 depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 111 - pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two

 * (hcv-rna pcr assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 iu/ml) lack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable hcv-rna with a &lt; 2 log
 10 reduction from baseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>
 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 %

 .</p><p>118</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 119 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 124 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.

 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response</p><p>(i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1).

 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and

 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log

 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-
 29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available for 
 the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 129 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 130 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 131 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 132</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3). 
 133</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>adults the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue,

 *these adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy.</p><p>most cases of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in combination 
 with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, 
 loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infected patients 
 for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other 
 undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).</p><p>
 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 137 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4 g/dl) was 
 reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), 
 depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine 
 treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated tsh.</p><p>

 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p><p>

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 141 - pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or 
 undetectable levels of hcv-rna. these time points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have

 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus

 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>

 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>

 elderly patients

 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 149 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 c:</p><p>3 morning, 3 evening</p><p>d: 3 morning, 4 evening</p><p>duration of treatment – naïve patients predictability of sustained virological response:</p><p>patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve undetectable hcv-rna or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 or 12 are 
 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 154 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>
 - 
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older :</p><p>
 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24. 
 • genotype 2 or 3:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. it is recommended that children and 
 adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if 
 their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.</p><p>pegintron monotherapy – adults

 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 159 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 160 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 161 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 162</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3). 
 163</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>adults the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue,

 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, 
 loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infected patients 
 for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other 
 undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).</p><p>
 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 167 although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was 
 reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), 
 depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine 
 treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated tsh.</p><p>

 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: interferons, atc code: l03ab10.</p><p>
 170 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in 171 patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin

 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained 
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 %

 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing 178 interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 183 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>
 - 
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older :</p><p>
 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24. 
 • genotype 2 or 3:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. it is recommended that children and 
 adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 188 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 189 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 190 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 191</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 192 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>adults the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue,

 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 196 although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm

 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was 
 reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up

 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: interferons, atc code: l03ab10.</p><p>
 199 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 nterferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in 200 patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 %

 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 during a clinical study.</p><p>in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing 207 interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 212 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>

 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log

 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 217 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 218 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 219 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 220</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 during the treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.</p><p>
 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be

 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy,

 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), 
 depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine

 §class effect of interferon-alfa containing products – reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric patients; with pegintron reported in adult patients.</p><p>most of the changes in laboratory values in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or moderate. decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin 
 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: interferons, atc code: l03ab10.</p><p>
 228 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in 229 patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients

 laboratory</p><p>*intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed
 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential

 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 236 during a clinical study. in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be

 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 241 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1).

 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response</p><p>(i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>
 - 
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older :</p><p>
 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60 
 μg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and 
 evening).</p><p>
 duration of treatment</p><p>• genotype 1:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical data on 
 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24. 
 • genotype 2 or 3:</p><p>the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment is 1 year. it is recommended that children and 
 adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if 
 their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log

 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 246 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 247 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 248 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 249</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse

 257 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in 258 patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>
 a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two 
 pegintron/ribavirin regimens [pegintron 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in 
 combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and peginterferon alfa-
 2a 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily (in two divided 
 doses) in 3,070 treatment-naïve adults with chronic hepatitis c genotype 1. response to the treatment

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or

 .</p><p>overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin

 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p><p>- 
 long-term efficacy data 
 a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron 
 (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained 
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential

 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 265 during a clinical study. in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
 paediatric patients 3 years of age and older: pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, not previously treated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.</p><p> 
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition. the reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. the decision 
 to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also</p><p>section 5.1). 
 • genotype 1:</p><p>- patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 270 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). 
 • genotypes 2 or 3:</p><p>it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected 
 patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 • genotype 4:</p><p>in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infection the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype. 
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>
 duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response
 : all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna below the limits 
 of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of 
 therapy (see also section 5.1). 
 retreatment duration greater than 48</p><p>weeks in non
 -responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.</p><p>

 dosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by 
 body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 60

 combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive value 
 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log

 • special populations</p><p>
 use in renal impairment:</p><p>
 monotherapy:</p><p>pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients 
 with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued.</p><p>

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient 
 followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:</p><p>if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. 
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events</p><p>
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).</p><p>
 patients with substance use/abuse: hcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 275 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). the longer term data available in 
 children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of 
 substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) 
 in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more than 5 years.</p><p>
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children:</p><p>the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the reversibility of which is uncertain. 
 - 
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).</p><p>
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. there are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.</p><p>acute hypersensitivity: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p><p>
 cardiovascular system: as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, 
 myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy. there are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 liver function: as with all interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p><p>
 pyrexia: while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during 
 interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>
 276 hydration: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p> 
 pulmonary changes: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, 
 have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, 
 dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p><p>
 autoimmune disease: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been 
 reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 ocular changes: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, and retinal 
 artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p><p>
 thyroid changes:</p><p>infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have 
 developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of 
 children treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower 
 limit of normal. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid 
 abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, 
 during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid 
 dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh 
 levels can be maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be 
 monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).</p><p>
 metabolic disturbances: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes 
 severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>
 hcv/hiv co-infection 
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 277 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p><p>dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, 
 have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p><p>
 organ transplant recipients:</p><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicate that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p><p>
 other: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use 
 of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>
 laboratory tests: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be 
 conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).</p><p>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron:</p><p>
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 278</p><p>it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders patients with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant 
 effect on the time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
 carcinoma, death and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. 
 pegintron should therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medicine with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone:</p><p>
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection: 
 nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has 
 resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p><p>
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine spc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).

 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 283 although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm

 reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 paediatric patients in a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). weight loss and 
 growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from 
 baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth 
 velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).</p><p>at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). based on interim data from the long-term follow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt;15 percentile decrease in 
 height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment 
 for more than 1 year. in particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up 
 was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache (62 %), 
 neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). only 1 subject 
 discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the majority of adverse 
 reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse reactions were reported 
 in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache 
 (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent adverse reactions that 
 occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), 
 depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: interferons, atc code: l03ab10.</p><p>
 286 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p><p>
 • interferon alfa-2b in vitro</p><p>and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p><p>
 • pegintron pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p><p>
 pegintron clinical trials – adults - naïve patients 
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other 
 (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). 
 - 
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 - 
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in 287 patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6 sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48). 
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p><p>
 a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two 
 pegintron/ribavirin regimens [pegintron 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in 
 combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and peginterferon 
 alfa-2a 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily (in two divided 
 doses) in 3,070 treatment-naïve adults with chronic hepatitis c genotype 1. response to the treatment 
 was measured by sustained virologic response (svr) which is defined as undetectable hcv-rna at

 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %.</p><p>
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or 
 undetectable levels of hcv-rna. these time points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have

 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p><p>pegintron clinical trials – paediatric patients</p><p>children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis c and detectable hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60 
 μg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>a total of 107 patients received 
 treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % caucasian, 67 % with hcv genotype 1 and 63 % 
 &lt; 12 years of age. the population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate 
 hepatitis c. due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential 
 for undesirable effects</p></section><section><header>,</header><p> the benefit/risk of the combination of pegintron with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). the study results are

 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>renal function: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a 
 single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p><p>
 hepatic function: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
 hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>
 elderly patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron 
 dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>
 paediatric patients: multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules 
 and oral solution) in children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated 
 294 during a clinical study. in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing 
 of pegintron at 60 
 μg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 
 1.5 
 μg/kg/week.</p><p>
 interferon neutralising factors:</p><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of 
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p><p>
 transfer into seminal fluid: seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in 
 seminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic 
 exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and 
 remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintron: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p><p>
 pegintron plus ribavirin: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects 
 not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a 
 reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol spc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection: -</p><p>disodium phosphate, anhydrous

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.</p></section><section><header>teeth and mouth problems</header><p>these have been reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. you may develop</p></section><section><header>gum disease,</header><p>which could lead to loss of teeth. you may develop a</p></section><section><header>dry mouth</header><p>or</p></section><section><header>vomiting,</header><p>both of which can damage your teeth. it is important to brush your teeth thoroughly</p><p>twice a day, rinse your mouth 
 out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.</p></section><section><header>eye problems</header><p>during treatment, some patients may experience</p></section><section><header>eye problems,</header><p>or loss of vision in rare instances. your doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. in case of any 
 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 335 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - 
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 336 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section“how to self-inject 
 pegintron”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by 
 adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 
 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be 
 clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) 
 or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of 
 ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh.

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients 
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up

 344</p></section><section><header>how to self-inject pegintron?  your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject pegintron. do not attempt to 
 inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-
 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparation collect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection; 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml). a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 -</p><p>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. 
 -</p><p>clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose. 
 -</p><p>remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>. -</p><p>take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. 
 -</p><p>remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand. 
 -</p><p>tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule. 
 -</p><p>break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. 
 -</p><p>insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent. 
 -</p><p>then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. 
 -</p><p>inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern. 
 -</p><p>dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial. 
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. 
 -</p><p>the contents should now be completely dissolved. 
 -</p><p>stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 345 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 348 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control

 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section“how to self-inject 
 pegintron”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by 
 adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 
 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be 
 clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) 
 or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of 
 ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 350 2. read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, follow 
 your doctor’s instructions. 
 3. if you have any questions about the dose, ask your doctor.</p><p>

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up 
 for the forgotten dose and, then continue your treatment as usual. 
 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used 
 alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.</p><p>
 351</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system:</header><p>some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed 
 suicide. seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts 
 or change in your behaviour. ask a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of 
 depression or changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 children and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with pegintron and ribavirin. immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display 
 any unusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>with up to one year of treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, some children and adolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. some children did not reach their projected 
 height within 1-5 years after completing treatment.</p></section><section><header>contact your doctor immediately</header><p> if you notice any of the following side effects occurring during treatment:

 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparation collect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection; 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white</p><p>tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white</p><p>powder. 
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml). a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 -</p><p>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. 
 -</p><p>clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose. 
 -</p><p>remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>. -</p><p>take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. 
 -</p><p>remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand. 
 -</p><p>tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule. 
 -</p><p>break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. 
 -</p><p>insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent. 
 -</p><p>then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. 
 -</p><p>inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern. 
 -</p><p>dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial. 
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. 
 -</p><p>the contents should now be completely dissolved. 
 -</p><p>stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 358 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 361 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 362 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section“how to self-inject 
 pegintron”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by 
 adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 
 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be 
 clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) 
 or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of 
 ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh.

 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly

 370</p></section><section><header>how to self-inject pegintron?  your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject pegintron. do not attempt to 
 inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-
 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparation collect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection; 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white</p><p>tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white</p><p>powder. 
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml). a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 -</p><p>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. 
 -</p><p>clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose. 
 -</p><p>remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>. -</p><p>take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. 
 -</p><p>remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand. 
 -</p><p>tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule. 
 -</p><p>break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. 
 -</p><p>insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent. 
 -</p><p>then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. 
 -</p><p>inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern. 
 -</p><p>dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial. 
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. 
 -</p><p>the contents should now be completely dissolved. 
 -</p><p>stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 371 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.</p></section><section><header>teeth and mouth problems</header><p>these have been reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. you may develop</p></section><section><header>gum disease,</header><p>which could lead to loss of teeth. you may develop a</p></section><section><header>dry mouth</header><p>or</p></section><section><header>vomiting,</header><p>both of which can damage your teeth. it is important to brush your teeth thoroughly</p><p>twice a day, rinse your mouth 
 out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.</p></section><section><header>eye problems</header><p>during treatment, some patients may experience</p></section><section><header>eye problems,</header><p>or loss of vision in rare instances. your doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. in case of any 
 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 374 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 375 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>

 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section“how to self-inject 
 pegintron”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by 
 adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 
 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be 
 clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) 
 or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of 
 ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 376 2. read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, follow 
 your doctor’s instructions.

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up 
 for the forgotten dose and, then continue your treatment as usual. 
 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used 
 alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system:</header><p>377 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed 
 suicide. seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts 
 or change in your behaviour. ask a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of 
 depression or changes in your behaviour.</p><p>

 383</p></section><section><header>how to self-inject pegintron?  your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject pegintron. do not attempt to 
 inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-
 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparation collect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection; 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white</p><p>tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white</p><p>powder. 
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml). a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 -</p><p>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. 
 -</p><p>clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose. 
 -</p><p>remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>. -</p><p>take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. 
 -</p><p>remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand. 
 -</p><p>tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule. 
 -</p><p>break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. 
 -</p><p>insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent. 
 -</p><p>then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. 
 -</p><p>inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern. 
 -</p><p>dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial. 
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. 
 -</p><p>the contents should now be completely dissolved. 
 -</p><p>stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 384 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 387 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 388 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section“how to self-inject 
 pegintron”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by 
 adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 
 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be 
 clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) 
 or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of 
 ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 389 2. read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take.

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly

 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used 
 alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system:</header><p>390 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed 
 suicide. seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts 
 or change in your behaviour. ask a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of 
 depression or changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 children and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with pegintron and ribavirin. immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display 
 any unusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>with up to one year of treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, some children and adolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. some children did not reach their projected 
 height within 1-5 years after completing treatment.</p></section><section><header>contact your doctor immediately</header><p> if you notice any of the following side effects occurring during treatment:

 396</p></section><section><header>how to self-inject pegintron?  your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject pegintron. do not attempt to 
 inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-
 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparation collect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection; 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white</p><p>tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white</p><p>powder. 
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml). a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 -</p><p>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. 
 -</p><p>clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose. 
 -</p><p>remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>. -</p><p>take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. 
 -</p><p>remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand. 
 -</p><p>tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule. 
 -</p><p>break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. 
 -</p><p>insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent. 
 -</p><p>then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. 
 -</p><p>inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern. 
 -</p><p>dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial. 
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. 
 -</p><p>the contents should now be completely dissolved. 
 -</p><p>stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 397 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.</p></section><section><header>teeth and mouth problems</header><p>these have been reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. you may develop</p></section><section><header>gum disease,</header><p>which could lead to loss of teeth. you may develop a</p></section><section><header>dry mouth</header><p>or</p></section><section><header>vomiting,</header><p>both of which can damage your teeth. it is important to brush your teeth thoroughly</p><p>twice a day, rinse your mouth 
 out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.</p></section><section><header>eye problems</header><p>during treatment, some patients may experience</p></section><section><header>eye problems,</header><p>or loss of vision in rare instances. your doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. in case of any 
 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 400 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 401 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see annex to the package 
 leaflet “how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the 
 solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the 
 solution. discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it after you give yourself 
 the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>
 combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 402 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 2. 
 read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, follow 
 your doctor’s instructions.

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up 
 for the forgotten dose and, then continue your treatment as usual. 
 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p><p>
 403</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the pegintron which 
 will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p>411 •</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
  figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper

 413</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your 
 dose, it is extra.

 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 418 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicine contains sucrose. if you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see annex to the package 
 leaflet “how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the 
 solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the 
 solution. discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it after you give yourself 
 the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>
 combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 419 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 2. 
 read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, follow 
 your doctor’s instructions. 
 3. 
 if you have any questions about the dose, ask your doctor.</p><p>

 for patients using this treatment for the first time, the usual length of treatment is up to one year. 
 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up 
 for the forgotten dose and, then continue your treatment as usual. 
 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p><p>
 420</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used 
 alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system:</header><p>some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed 
 suicide. seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts 
 or change in your behaviour. ask a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of 
 depression or changes in your behaviour.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the pegintron which 
 will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p>428 •</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button

 430</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 434 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 435 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>

 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see annex to the package 
 leaflet “how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the 
 solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the 
 solution. discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it after you give yourself 
 the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>
 combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 436 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below:

 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly

 437</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. when pegintron is used 
 alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system:</header><p>some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed 
 suicide. seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts 
 or change in your behaviour. ask a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of 
 depression or changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 children and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with pegintron and ribavirin. immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display 
 any unusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents):</header><p>with up to one year of treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, some children and adolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. some children did not reach their projected

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the pegintron which 
 will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p>445 •</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
  figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: 
 pegintron is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents 
 who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron

 451 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 452 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>

 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see annex to the package 
 leaflet “how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the 
 solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the 
 solution. discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it after you give yourself 
 the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>
 combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 453 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 2. read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, 
 follow your doctor’s instructions.

 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains:

 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the pegintron which 
 will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p>462 •</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle.

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
  figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper

 464</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in pegintron is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help fight 
 infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your immune 
 system. pegintron is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the liver.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 adult patients: 
 the combination of pegintron and ribavirin is recommended for adults who have not previously been 
 treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically stable hiv (human 
 immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have already failed 
 treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or interferon alpha 
 alone.</p><p>
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe pegintron alone.</p><p>
 children and adolescents:

 pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.</p></section><section><header>teeth and mouth problems</header><p>these have been reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. you may develop</p></section><section><header>gum disease,</header><p>which could lead to loss of teeth. you may develop a</p></section><section><header>dry mouth</header><p>or</p></section><section><header>vomiting,</header><p>both of which can damage your teeth. it is important to brush your teeth thoroughly</p><p>twice a day, rinse your mouth 
 out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.</p></section><section><header>eye problems</header><p>during treatment, some patients may experience</p></section><section><header>eye problems,</header><p>or loss of vision in rare instances. your doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. in case of any 
 changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you 
 468 have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if 
 you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p><p>
 your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure 
 that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for:</p><p>− are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 − are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. 
 o taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction 
 in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with pegintron alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. 
 o with</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. 
 − are taking</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p>. if you take</p></section><section><header>telbivudine</header><p> with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, 
 tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. these events may also be 
 more severe. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated.</p><p>
 reminder: please read the “taking other medicines” section of the package leaflet for</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>before using it in combination with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>pregnancy: ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of pegintron 
 on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use effective 
 birth control (two different methods) during the treatment with pegintron.</p><p>
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>special precautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: -</p><p>
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 469 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 breast-feeding: 
 it is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. therefore,</p></section><section><header>do not breast-feed</header><p> an infant if you are taking pegintron.</p><p>

 this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>general information about taking pegintron:</p><p>
 your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for your current condition or the current condition of 
 the child you are caring for; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined the correct dose of pegintron based on how much you or the child you are 
 caring for weighs. if necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection.</p></section><section><header>detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see annex to the package 
 leaflet “how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen”)</header><p>.</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the 
 solution if it is discoloured (changed it’s colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the 
 solution. discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it after you give yourself 
 the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 “how to store pegintron”.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p><p>
 combination treatment with ribavirin 
 - adults:</p><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per kilogram of body weight once a week. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending 
 upon your kidney function.</p><p>
 470 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening with food.the usual dose of ribavirin,according to how much you weigh, is shown in the table below: 
 1. 
 look for the line that shows how much you weigh. 
 2. 
 read across on the same line to see how many hard capsules to take. 
 reminder: if your doctor’s instructions are different from the amounts in the below table, follow 
 your doctor’s instructions.

 please read</p></section><section><header>ribavirin</header><p>package leaflet before you begin combination treatment with pegintron.</p><p>if you are co-infected with hcv/hiv, you should continue treatment for 48 weeks. 
 if you previously relapsed or have not responded to interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin, you 
 should continue treatment for one year. this will be determined based on your response after the first 
 12 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 - children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: the dose is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. ribavirin should be taken morning and evening with food. the duration of 
 treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor’s judgement for you or the child you are caring for.</p><p>pegintron alone - adults 
 pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of body 
 weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>
 all patients</p><p>
 if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly 
 provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take/administer the dose of pegintron in combination with ribavirin as soon as you remember unless it is very close to your next injection. if it is very close to your next injection, you should not make up 
 for the forgotten dose and, then continue your treatment as usual. 
 contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are carting for if 
 needed.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the pegintron which 
 will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p>479 •</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button 
 holder</p><p>480</p></section><section><header>step 3: set the dose                      
     figure 4</header><p>• take the pen from the tray holder.</p><p>• holding the pen firmly, pull the dosing button out as far as it will go, until you see a</p></section><section><header>dark ring</header><p> on the pen. the dosing button should be easy to pull out without too much force 
 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
  figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper 
 dark ring 
 481</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your 
 dose, it is extra. 
 • once the injection site is dry, pull off the</p></section><section><header>yellow inner needle cap</header><p> carefully exposing the injection needle. you are now ready to inject.</p><p>outer needle

 • do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. • discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with the needle safely in a closed rigid container.</p></section><section><header>after 2 hours, check the injection site for redness, swelling, or tenderness. if you have a skin reaction and it doesn’t clear up in a few days, contact your health care 
 professional.

 the dosing button</header><p>(figure 7)</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>• with your other hand, pinch a fold of loose skin in the area you have cleaned for injection. 
 • insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. • press the dosing button down</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p> and</p></section><section><header>firmly</header><p> until the button can no longer move. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keep your thumb pressed down on the dosing button for an additional 5 seconds</header><p> to ensure that you get the complete dose.</p></section></body></xml>
