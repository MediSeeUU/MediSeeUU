 responders (see also</p><p>section</p></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1</header><p>). •</p></section><section><header>genotype 1</header><p>: for patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). 
 in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment 
 duration (see section 5.1). 
 •</p></section><section><header>genotypes 2 or 3</header><p>: it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 •</p></section><section><header>genotype 4:</header><p> in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for

 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104;

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in 
 some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are 
 generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have 
 occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>8monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>9 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>10treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> 
 methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events included suicidal ideation and 
 attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p> cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy,

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4). 
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific 
 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-</p><p>15infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>20</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>29monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>30 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>31treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.</p><p>studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and

 *these adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy.</p><p>most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).</p><p>35 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease in cd4+ 
 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific 
 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>36for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 rates were 59 % and 47 %, respectively. in patients with &gt; 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at 
 week 12, the estimated svr is overall about 6 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>41upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p>42studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>50monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>51 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>52treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and 
 injection site reaction. additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of subjects 
 included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability</p><p>53and insomnia. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of 
 therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur 
 at a notably lower rate in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy compared to those treated with

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events included suicidal ideation and 
 attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p> cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute 
 cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products

 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>57for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>62upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into

 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>71monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>72 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially

 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>78for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>83upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>92monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>93 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>94treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and

 combination with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p> 
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).</p><p>98 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease in cd4+ 
 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific 
 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>99for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 rates were 59 % and 47 %, respectively. in patients with &gt; 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at 
 week 12, the estimated svr is overall about 6 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>104upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p>105studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>113monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>114 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>115treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and

 included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability</p><p>116and insomnia. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of 
 therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur 
 at a notably lower rate in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy compared to those treated with

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products

 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>120for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>125upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been

 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>134monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>135 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in

 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute 
 cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-</p><p>141infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p><p>146</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>155monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>156 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>157treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the 
 potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and

 combination with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).</p><p>161 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease in cd4+ 
 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific 
 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>162for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 was a 57 % (282/499) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior failure on therapy

 rates were 59 % and 47 %, respectively. in patients with &gt; 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at 
 week 12, the estimated svr is overall about 6 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>167upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p>168studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have 
 been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms 
 of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is 
 identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, 
 with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>176monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>177 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was 
 observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron</p><p>178treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of 
 childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 
 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and

 included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability</p><p>179and insomnia. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of 
 therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur 
 at a notably lower rate in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy compared to those treated with

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products

 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>183for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>188upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been

 in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>:</p><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in 
 some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-
 month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients 
 should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms 
 appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing 
 physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric 
 symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with 
 pegintron be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 there is no experience with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in patients who have relapsed after 
 interferon alpha + ribavirin therapy.</p><p>all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be</p><p>197monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn</p><p>and</p><p>corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 moreover, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at 
 increased risk of developing anaemia.</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>198 patients with low cd4 counts: in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with

 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12%

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell 
 percentage. the decrease in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of 
 therapy. the use of pegintron in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the 
 control of hiv viraemia during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-
 infected patients with cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p> please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible</p><p>204for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 week 12, the estimated svr is overall about 6 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin were less likely to respond to 
 retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin (4 % vs. 17 %).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>209upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 
 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p>210studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was 
 a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either

  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 - 
 if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 - 
 if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 - 
 if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 - 
 if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 - 
 if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p> 249- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 - 
 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 - 
 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 - 
 if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 - 
 if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron.

 if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. - 
 if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 - 
 if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>250it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>251in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>252blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>253of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 - 
 a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 - 
 an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 - 
 a 1 ml syringe; 
 - 
 a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 - 
 a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; - 
 a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>257slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>258</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 80 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 - 
 if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 - 
 if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 - 
 if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 - 
 if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 - 
 if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p> 259- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 - 
 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 - 
 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 - 
 if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 - 
 if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. - 
 if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 - 
 if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>260it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>261in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>262blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>263of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 - 
 a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 - 
 an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 - 
 a 1 ml syringe; 
 - 
 a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 - 
 a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; - 
 a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>267slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>268</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 100 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron.

 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 - 
 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 - 
 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 - 
 if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 - 
 if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron.

 if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>270it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>271in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>272blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>

 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed

 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>273of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 - 
 a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 - 
 an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 - 
 a 1 ml syringe; 
 - 
 a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 - 
 a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; - 
 a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>277slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>278</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 120 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>280it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>

 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of

 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>282blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>283of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 - 
 a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 - 
 an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 - 
 a 1 ml syringe; 
 - 
 a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 - 
 a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; - 
 a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>287slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>288</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 150 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during

 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products.

 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if

 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>292blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>

 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>293of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 - 
 a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 - 
 an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 - 
 a 1 ml syringe; 
 - 
 a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 - 
 a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; - 
 a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>297slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>298</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user

 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>300it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products.

 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if

 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>302blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>303of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of

 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count.

 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>312it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>313in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>314blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>315of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy

 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>324it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective

 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products.

 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>326blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>327of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 - 
 if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 - 
 if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 - 
 if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 - 
 if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 - 
 if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p> 335- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 - 
 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 - 
 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 - 
 if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 - 
 if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. - 
 if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 - 
 if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>336it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>337in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>338blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>339of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 - 
 if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 - 
 if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 - 
 if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 - 
 if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 - 
 if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p> 347- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 - 
 if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 - 
 if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 - 
 if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 - 
 if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 - 
 if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 - 
 if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 - 
 if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 - 
 if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. - 
 if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 - 
 if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 - 
 if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>348it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 - 
 if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 - 
 if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 - 
 if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>349in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>350blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>

 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight,

 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as toxic epidermal 
 necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree</p><p>351of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>
