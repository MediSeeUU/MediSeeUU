 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 85 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total
 1,200 mg each day).
 the combination treatment is continued for at least 6 months, and sometimes for one year.</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>:pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or
 pharmacist.
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or
 pharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>6like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur,they may need medical attention if they do.
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the
 way your heart beats; breathing problems, confusion; feeling depressed, wanting to harm yourself,
 numbness or tingling feeling; trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; severe stomach pain; fever or
 chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; problems with your
 eyesight or hearing; severe bleeding from your nose; your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) count and platelets (blood clotting cells) are at acceptable
 levels.
 the most common side effects with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules are irritation
 or redness at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms,
 weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose stools, stomach pain, vomiting,
 muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, trouble falling asleep or
 staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, hair loss, itching,
 dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, rash, and dry mouth.
 other common side effects that may occur with combination treatment are increased sweating, chest
 pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland
 activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), constipation, stomach upset,
 rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period, stuffy or runny nose,
 change in taste, blurred vision.
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes,
 redness of skin or skin disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, confusion, increased or decreased
 sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, loss of interest in sex, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning feeling),
 intestinal gas (flatus), bleeding gums or sores in mouth, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst,

 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparation
 collect necessary items before you begin:
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in
 pieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab.
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial
 with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 9slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solution
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle:
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site),
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the
 plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure
 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparation
 collect necessary items before you begin:
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in
 pieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab.
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial
 with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 16slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solution
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle:
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site),
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the
 plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial
 with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 23slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solution
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle:
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site),
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the
 plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or
 pharmacist if needed.
 27</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur,they may need medical attention if they do.

 activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), constipation, stomach upset,
 rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period, stuffy or runny nose,
 change in taste, blurred vision.
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes,
 redness of skin or skin disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, confusion, increased or decreased
 sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, loss of interest in sex, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning feeling),

 preparation
 collect necessary items before you begin:
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in
 pieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab.
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparation
 collect necessary items before you begin:
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in
 pieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab.
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial
 with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 37slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solution
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle:
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site),
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the
 plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p></section></body></xml>
