 therapeutic indications</header><p>pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases withoutliver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded(with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have
 subsequently relapsed.
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or
 contraindication to ribavirin.
 please refer also to the ribavirin summary of product characteristics (spc) when pegintron is to be
 used in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header>dose to be administered</header><p>pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administereddepends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.</p></section><section><header>combination therapy</header><p>pegintron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.the intended dose of 1.5

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>7</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p>8 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception
 during the treatment period.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in humanmilk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued
 prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p> ribavirin is teratogenic and embryocidal and must not be used in pregnant women (see ribavirin spc,</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned toavoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>the safety of pegintron is evaluated from data from two clinical trials: one with pegintronmonotherapy, one with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. in both cases, patients were treated
 for one year.</p></section><section><header>table 3</header><p> describes the regimens and patient exposure for one year of treatment in patients with noprevious exposure to interferon (interferon-naïve patients). because of a significant overlap in the

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 14metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.

 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c

 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>25</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>26</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception
 during the treatment period.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in humanmilk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued

 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have
 been reported rarely.
 30 rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheralneuropathy, and diabetes.
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>very rarely following the marketing of pegintron, cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson

 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons,peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p> pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 31metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p> pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume ofdistribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p> upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p> mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance
 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p> based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however,
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 � 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severehepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>����</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a singlesubcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>34</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performedon these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data
 pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most
 monkeys.</p><p> reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not knownwhether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicitystudies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitromutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause anyeffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with

 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>42</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 48metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,

 therapeutic indications</header><p>pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases withoutliver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded(with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have
 subsequently relapsed.
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or
 contraindication to ribavirin.

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>59</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>60</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 65metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.

 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>76</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>77</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception

 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have
 been reported rarely.
 81 rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheralneuropathy, and diabetes.
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>very rarely following the marketing of pegintron, cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson

 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons,peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p> pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 82metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p> pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume ofdistribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p> upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p> mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance
 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p> based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however,
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 � 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severehepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>����</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a singlesubcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p><p>85</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performedon these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of
 patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data
 pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most
 monkeys.</p><p> reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not knownwhether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicitystudies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitromutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause anyeffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with

 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>93</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 99metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 therapeutic indications</header><p>pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases withoutliver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded(with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have
 subsequently relapsed.
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or
 contraindication to ribavirin.
 please refer also to the ribavirin summary of product characteristics (spc) when pegintron is to be
 used in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header>dose to be administered</header><p>pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administereddepends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.</p></section><section><header>combination therapy</header><p>pegintron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.the intended dose of 1.5

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>110</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>111</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 116metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p> pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume ofdistribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p> upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p> mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance
 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c

 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>127</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>128</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be
 used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception

 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have
 been reported rarely.
 132 rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheralneuropathy, and diabetes, and retinopathies (including macular oedema).
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>very rarely following the marketing of pegintron, cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson

 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons,peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p> pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 133metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p> pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume ofdistribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p> upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p> mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance
 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p> based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however,
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 � 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severehepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>����</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a singlesubcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performedon these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p><p>136</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samplesof patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data
 pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most
 monkeys.</p><p> reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not knownwhether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicitystudies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitromutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause anyeffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily

 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons

 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid

 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a geneticallyengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p> in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferonalfa-2b moiety.</p><p> interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 150metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 therapeutic indications</header><p>pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases withoutliver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded(with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have
 subsequently relapsed.
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or
 contraindication to ribavirin.
 please refer also to the ribavirin summary of product characteristics (spc) when pegintron is to be
 used in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header>dose to be administered</header><p>pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administereddepends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.</p></section><section><header>combination therapy</header><p>pegintron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.the intended dose of 1.5

 (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to
 commencing treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute
 appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure,myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidalideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with
 alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who developprolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferontherapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy sincehypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p><p>161</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting infatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever,
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of
 interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with
 resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has beenreported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinalartery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocularsymptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha havedeveloped thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimessevere, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be atincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis,use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit
 justifies the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must beconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p> �platelets� 100,000/mm3 �neutrophil count� 1,500/mm3 �tsh levelmust be within normal limits</p><p> laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter asclinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>162</p><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome(cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p> no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has beenshown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should not be

 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic
 effects.</p><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exactantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell
 167metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions areunable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects byexamining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin
 and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects
 treated with pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single
 doses of pegintron between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was
 increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of
 week 4 correlated with the dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other(c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a
 week [tiw]) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b
 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the
 following combination regimens:
 � pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).� pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 � interferon alfa-2b (3 miu tiw) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly inpatients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate sixmonths after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load,
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p> pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume ofdistribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p> upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p> mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance
 of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully
 elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron
 apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in asingle dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p> based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however,
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renaldysfunction or creatinine clearance

 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or
 pharmacist.
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.290</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure
 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparationcollect necessary items before you begin:-</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injectionbefore reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or inpieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing
 swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe
 from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to
 the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with
 the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is
 at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the
 ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured
 and injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to
 ensure delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the
 vial with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 294measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injectionturn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintronreconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solutionselect the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin andmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use
 this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or
 outer surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the
 needle is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure
 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparationcollect necessary items before you begin:-</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injectionbefore reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or inpieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing
 swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe
 from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to
 the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with
 the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is
 at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the
 ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured
 and injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to
 ensure delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the
 vial with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 302measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injectionturn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintronreconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solutionselect the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin andmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use
 this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or
 outer surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the
 needle is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure
 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparationcollect necessary items before you begin:-</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injectionbefore reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or inpieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing
 swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe
 from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to
 the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with
 the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is
 at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the
 ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured
 and injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to
 ensure delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the
 vial with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 310measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injectionturn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintronreconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solutionselect the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin andmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use
 this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or
 outer surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove theneedle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the
 needle is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.322</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure
 and requirement of self-injection.
 preparationcollect necessary items before you begin:-</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections);
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe;
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 � 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water forinjections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 � 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-</p><p>a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injectionbefore reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or inpieces, or as a white powder.
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing
 swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe
 from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to
 the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with
 the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is
 at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the
 ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5
 ml).
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured
 and injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to
 ensure delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the
 vial with your hands.
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not toaim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be
 expected and is not cause for concern.
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powderat the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24
 hours.
 326measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injectionturn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintronreconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger
 slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.

 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solutionselect the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin andmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use

 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection,
 discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.

 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.350do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor orpharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur,they may need medical attention if they do.

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection,
 discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.

 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.360do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor orpharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur,they may need medical attention if they do.

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection,
 discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.370do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor orpharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur,they may need medical attention if they do.
