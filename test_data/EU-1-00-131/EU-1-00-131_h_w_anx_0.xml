  each vial of pegintron, powder for solution for injection contains 50 micrograms of peginterferon 
 alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol).

  pegintron is indicated in monotherapy in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin, for 
 the treatment of adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis c who have serum 
 markers for virus c replication, e.g. those who have elevated transaminases without liver 
 decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv. 
  
 the optimal treatment for chronic hepatitis c is considered to be the administration of a 
 combination of interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. 
 the safety and efficacy of the combination of pegintron and ribavirin has not yet been documented.</header></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>pegintron treatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once weekly for at least 6 months. the dose should be selected based on the anticipated efficacy and</header><p>3</p></section><section><header>safety (see</header><p>4.8</p></section><section><header>and</header><p>5.1</p></section><section><header>). in patients showing loss of hcv-rna at 6 months, treatment is continued for an additional 6 months, i.e.1 year of treatment. 
  if adverse events develop during the course of treatment, it is recommended that the dose of 
 pegintron be modified to one-half the starting dose once weekly. if persistent or recurrent 
 intolerance develops following dose adjustment, discontinue treatment with pegintron.

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute 
 hypersensitivity 
 reactions 
 (e.g., 
 urticaria, 
 angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-
 2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p><p> 
 debilitating medical conditions</p></section><section><header>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</header><p>pulmonary changes</p></section><section><header>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been 
 defined. these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon 
 alpha when shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient 
 developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if 
 the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, 
 the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this 
 has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it 
 has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt 
 discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be 
 associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</header><p>5autoimmune disease</p></section><section><header>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may 
 occur more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders. 
  ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons. any patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. 
 because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to 
 initiation of pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p><p>
 other</p></section><section><header>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the 
 potential risk. 
  laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable 
 baseline values that may be considered as a guideline are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level must be within normal limits</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>6</p></section><section><header>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2. 
  
 no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.

 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. pegintron should not be used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>
 pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment period.</p><p>
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue treatment or discontinue nursing, taking 
 into account the importance of the treatment to the mother.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines

 1.1.1.1. interferon alfa-2b 
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p> 9once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header n="1.2">1.2.

 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute 
 hypersensitivity 
 reactions 
 (e.g., 
 urticaria, 
 angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-
 2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p><p> 
 debilitating medical conditions</p></section><section><header>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</header><p>pulmonary changes</p></section><section><header>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been 
 defined. these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon 
 alpha when shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient 
 developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if 
 the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, 
 the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this 
 has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it 
 has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt 
 discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be 
 associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</header><p>18autoimmune disease</p></section><section><header>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may 
 occur more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders. 
  ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons. any patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. 
 because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to 
 initiation of pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alfa-2b have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. in clinical trials using 
 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p><p>
 other</p></section><section><header>: due to reports of interferon alfa-2b exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the 
 potential risk. 
  laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function are recommended in all patients prior to and periodically during treatment with pegintron. acceptable 
 baseline values that may be considered as a guideline are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level must be within normal limits</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>19</p></section><section><header>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be

 1.3.1.1. interferon alfa-2b 
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p> 22once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header n="1.4">1.4.

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute 
 hypersensitivity 
 reactions 
 (e.g., 
 urticaria, 
 angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-
 2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p><p> 
 debilitating medical conditions</p></section><section><header>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</header><p>pulmonary changes</p></section><section><header>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been 
 defined. these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon 
 alpha when shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient 
 developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if 
 the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, 
 the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this 
 has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it 
 has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt</header><p>31</p></section><section><header>discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</header><p>autoimmune disease</p></section><section><header>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may 
 occur more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders. 
  ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons. any patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. 
 because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to 
 initiation of pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects manifested by confusion and other alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha

 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p><p>

 1.5.1.1. interferon alfa-2b 
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p> 35once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header n="1.6">1.6.

 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but

 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute 
 hypersensitivity 
 reactions 
 (e.g., 
 urticaria, 
 angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-
 2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and

 developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if 
 the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, 
 the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this

 1.7.1.1. interferon alfa-2b 
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p> 48once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header n="1.8">1.8.

  cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute 
 hypersensitivity 
 reactions 
 (e.g., 
 urticaria, 
 angioedema, 
 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon alfa-2b have been rarely observed during interferon alfa-
 2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. fluid replacement may be 
 necessary.</p><p> 
 debilitating medical conditions</p></section><section><header>: pegintron must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive 
 pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. caution must be observed also in 
 patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe 
 myelosuppression.</header><p>pulmonary changes</p></section><section><header>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. the aetiology has not been 
 defined. these symptoms have been reported more frequently in patients treated with interferon 
 alpha when shosaikoto, a chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly. any patient 
 developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if 
 the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, 
 the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. while this 
 has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with interferon alpha, it 
 has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. prompt</header><p>57</p></section><section><header>discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.</header><p>autoimmune disease</p></section><section><header>: the development of auto-antibodies has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease during interferon therapy may 
 occur more frequently in patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders. 
  ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons. any patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field must have an eye examination. 
 because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual exam prior to 
 initiation of pegintron therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns

 interferon alfa-2b 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. these were controlled by 
 conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. the mechanism by which alpha interferons may alter 
 thyroid status is unknown. prior to initiation of pegintron therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
 c, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. any thyroid abnormality detected at that 
 time must be treated with conventional therapy. pegintron treatment may be initiated if tsh levels can 
 be maintained in the normal range by medication. determine tsh levels if, during the course of 
 therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of 
 thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the 
 normal range by medication.</p><p>

 1.9.1.1. interferon alfa-2b 
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p> 61once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header n="1.10">1.10.

 prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b. 
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours

 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean pegintron elimination half life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been</p><p> 63fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c

 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however,

 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab.

 syringe from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it 
 firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep 
 the syringe with the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure 
 that all the liquid is at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert 
 the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.</header><p>to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the 
 vial with your hands. 
 slowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid

 how to self-inject pegintron?</p><p>the following instructions explain how to inject pegintron yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-
 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation</p></section><section><header>collect necessary items before you begin:</header><p>208- a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection</p></section><section><header>remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the 
 syringe from the wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it 
 firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep 
 the syringe with the needle in your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure 
 that all the liquid is at the bottom of the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert 
 the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.</header><p>to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the 
 vial with your hands. 
 slowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid 
 production of air bubbles. do not aim the stream at the white powder at the bottom of the vial. 
 to dissolve the white contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the syringe 
 needle in the vial, until the contents are completely dissolved.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>. if air bubbles do form, wait until the solution has settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared 
 before withdrawing your dose from the vial. use this solution immediately.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection</p></section><section><header>turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on 
 the plunger slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. 
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle 
 and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle 
 and check for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; 
 tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up 
 the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with 
 the needle on a flat surface.</header><p>209</p></section><section><header>be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not 
 use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</header><p>injecting the solution</p></section><section><header>select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use 
 this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh 
 or outer surface of the arm for injection.</header><p>change your injection site each time.</p></section><section><header>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe 
 as you would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45</header><p>°</p></section><section><header>to 90</header><p>°</p></section><section><header n="">. after the needle is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back 
 the plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a 
 blood vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the 
 solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently.</header><p>pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p></section></body></xml>
