 non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>alimta must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of anti-cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>
 the alimta solution must be prepared according to the instructions provided in section 6.6.</p><p>
 malignant pleural mesothelioma: 
 in patients treated for malignant pleural mesothelioma, the recommended dose of alimta is 
 500 mg/m
 2 of body surface area (bsa) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. the recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m
 2 bsa infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 
 21-day cycle. patients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to 
 and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin summary of product characteristics for specific 
 dosing advice).</p><p>
 non-small cell lung cancer: 
 in patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose of alimta is 500 mg/m
 2 bsa administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</p><p>
 3 premedication regimen: to reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior 
 to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. the corticosteroid should be equivalent 
 to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 to reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see 
 section 4.4). patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 
 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. at least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven 
 days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of 
 therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. patients must also receive an intramuscular 
 injection of vitamin b
 12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. subsequent vitamin b
 12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed.</p><p>
 monitoring: 
 patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, 
 including a differential white cell count (wcc) and platelet count. prior to each chemotherapy 
 administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. before 
 the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute 
 neutrophil count (anc) should be 
 ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. creatinine clearance should be 
 ≥ 45 ml/min. the total bilirubin should be 
 ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. alkaline phosphatase (ap), aspartate transaminase (ast or sgot) and alanine transaminase (alt or sgpt) should be 
 ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal. alkaline phosphatase, ast and alt 
 ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement.</p><p>
 dose adjustments: 
 dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or 
 maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. treatment may be delayed 
 to allow sufficient time for recovery. upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines 
 in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for alimta used as a single agent or in combination with 
 cisplatin.</p></section><section><header>table 1 - dose modification table for alimta (as single agent or in combination) and cisplatin –haematologic toxicities</header><p>nadir anc &lt; 500 /mm3 and nadir platelets ≥ 50,000 /mm3 75 % of previous dose (both alimta and cisplatin).

 elderly: in clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. no dose reductions 
 other than those recommended for all patients are necessary.</p><p>
 children and adolescents: alimta is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</p><p>
 patients with renal impairment (standard cockcroft and gault formula or glomerular filtration rate measured tc99m-dpta serum clearance method): pemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by 
 renal excretion. in clinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance of 
 ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for all patients. there are insufficient data on the use of 
 pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is 
 not recommended (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 patients with hepatic impairment: no relationships between ast (sgot), alt (sgpt), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were identified. however patients with hepatic impairment 
 such as bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/or transaminase &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit 
 of normal (hepatic metastases absent) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases 
 present) have not been specifically studied.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be 
 given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (anc) returns to 
 ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to 
 ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir anc, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 in the phase 3 mesothelioma trial, overall less toxicity and reduction in grade 3/4 haematologic and 
 non-haematologic toxicities such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3/4 
 neutropenia were reported when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin b
 12 was administered. therefore patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin b
 12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 skin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. pre-treatment with 
 dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see section 
 4.2).</p><p>
 an insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. 
 therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of &lt; 45 ml/min is not 
 recommended (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should 
 avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) as ibuprofen, and aspirin (&gt; 1.3 g daily) 
 for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). 
 all patients eligible for pemetrexed therapy should avoid taking nsaids with long elimination half-
 lives for at least 5 days prior to, on the day, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration 
 (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in 
 association with other chemotherapeutic agents. many of the patients in whom these occurred had 
 underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing 
 hypertension or diabetes.</p><p>
 the effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is unknown. in 
 patients with clinically significant third space fluid, consideration should be given to draining the 
 effusion prior to pemetrexed administration.</p><p>
 due to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe 
 dehydration has been observed. therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and 
 appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment.</p><p>
 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been 
 uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination 
 with another cytotoxic agent. most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had pre-
 existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. as a result, concomitant use of live attenuated 
 vaccines (except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</p><p>
 pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. sexually mature males are advised not to father a 
 child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. contraceptive measures or abstinence are 
 6 recommended. owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed 
 (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, 
 during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy.</p><p>particular attention should be paid to these patients 
 and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents.</p><p>
 cases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years 
 previously.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by glomerular filtration. concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside, loop 
 diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of 
 pemetrexed. this combination should be used with caution. if necessary, creatinine clearance should 
 be closely monitored.</p><p>
 concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) 
 could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. caution should be made when these drugs 
 are combined with pemetrexed. if necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored.</p><p>
 in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal 
 anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg/day) and aspirin at higher dosage 
 (&gt; 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the occurrence of 
 pemetrexed adverse events. therefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of 
 nsaids or aspirin at higher dosage, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function 
 (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min). 
 in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the 
 concomitant administration of pemetrexed with nsaids (e.g. ibuprofen) or aspirin at higher dosage 
 should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration 
 (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in the absence of data regarding potential interaction with nsaids having longer half-lives as 
 piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 
 5 days prior to, on the day, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. results from 
 in vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition 
 of the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolised by cyp3a, cyp2d6, cyp2c9, and cyp1a2.</p><p>
 interactions common to all cytotoxics:</p><p>
 due to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is 
 frequent. the high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the 
 possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased 
 frequency of inr (international normalised ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with 
 oral anticoagulants. 
 concomitant use contraindicated: yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see 
 section 4.3). 
 concomitant use not recommended: live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever): risk of systemic, 
 possibly fatal, disease. the risk is increased in subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their 
 underlying disease. use an inactivated vaccine where it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>7 there are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other anti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. 
 animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). pemetrexed should not be used 
 during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and 
 the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. 
 pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. sexually mature males are advised not to father a 
 child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. contraceptive measures or abstinence are 
 recommended. owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men 
 are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</p><p>
 it is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the suckling 
 child cannot be excluded.</p><p>breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed therapy</p><p>(see 
 section 4.3)
 .</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. however, it has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. therefore patients should be cautioned against 
 driving or operating machines if this event occurs.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the table below provides the frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed 
 and 163 patients with mesothelioma randomised to receive single agent cisplatin. in both treatment

 clinically relevant ctc toxicities that were reported in &gt; 1 % and &lt; 5 % (common) of the patients that 
 were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: infection without neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, increased creatinine, motor neuropathy, sensory neuropathy,

 clinically relevant ctc toxicities that were reported in ≤ 1 % of the patients that were randomly 
 assigned to pemetrexed include supraventricular arrhythmias. 
 10</p><p>clinically relevant grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory toxicities were similar between integrated phase 2 results from three single agent pemetrexed studies (n = 164) and the phase 3 single agent pemetrexed 
 study described above, with the exception of neutropenia (12.8 % versus 5.3 %, respectively) and 
 alanine transaminase elevation (15.2 % versus 1.9 %, respectively). these differences were likely due 
 to differences in the patient population, since the phase 2 studies included both chemonaive and 
 heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients with pre-existing liver metastases and/or abnormal baseline 
 liver function tests.</p><p>
 serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, 
 cerebrovascular accident and transient ischaemic attack have been uncommonly reported during

 alimta (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by 
 disrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.</p><p>
 in vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (ts), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
 formyltransferase (garft), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the 
 de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate 
 carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly 
 and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. the 
 polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of ts and garft. 
 polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a 
 lesser extent, in normal tissues. polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life 
 resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy:</p><p>
 emphacis, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of alimta plus cisplatin versus 
 cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated 
 with alimta and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over 
 patients receiving cisplatin alone.</p><p>
 during the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin b
 12 supplementation was introduced to patients’ therapy to reduce toxicity. the primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all 
 patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug (randomised and treated). a 
 subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin b
 12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented). the results of these analyses of 
 efficacy are summarised in the table below:</p><p>

 2. in vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. binding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. pemetrexed undergoes 
 limited hepatic metabolism. pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the 
 administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following 
 administration. pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from 
 plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). 
 between patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
 (auc) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. the pharmacokinetics 
 of pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered

 2 bsa infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 
 21-day cycle. patients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to 
 and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin summary of product characteristics for specific 
 dosing advice).</p><p>
 non-small cell lung cancer:

 16 premedication regimen: to reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior 
 to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. the corticosteroid should be equivalent 
 to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 to reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see 
 section 4.4). patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 
 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. at least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven 
 days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of 
 therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. patients must also receive an intramuscular 
 injection of vitamin b
 12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. subsequent vitamin b
 12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed.</p><p>
 monitoring: 
 patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, 
 including a differential white cell count (wcc) and platelet count. prior to each chemotherapy 
 administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. before 
 the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute 
 neutrophil count (anc) should be 
 ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. creatinine clearance should be 
 ≥ 45 ml/min. the total bilirubin should be 
 ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. alkaline phosphatase (ap), aspartate transaminase (ast or sgot) and alanine transaminase (alt or sgpt) should be 
 ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal. alkaline phosphatase, ast and alt 
 ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement.</p><p>
 dose adjustments: 
 dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or 
 maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. treatment may be delayed 
 to allow sufficient time for recovery. upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines 
 in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for alimta used as a single agent or in combination with

 patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be 
 given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (anc) returns to 
 ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to 
 ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir anc, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 in the phase 3 mesothelioma trial, overall less toxicity and reduction in grade 3/4 haematologic and 
 non-haematologic toxicities such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3/4 
 neutropenia were reported when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin b
 12 was administered. therefore patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin b
 12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 skin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. pre-treatment with 
 dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see section 
 4.2).</p><p>
 an insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. 
 therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of &lt; 45 ml/min is not 
 recommended (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should 
 avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) as ibuprofen, and aspirin (&gt; 1.3 g daily) 
 for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). 
 all patients eligible for pemetrexed therapy should avoid taking nsaids with long elimination half-
 lives for at least 5 days prior to, on the day, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration 
 (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in 
 association with other chemotherapeutic agents. many of the patients in whom these occurred had 
 underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing 
 hypertension or diabetes.</p><p>
 the effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is unknown. in 
 patients with clinically significant third space fluid, consideration should be given to draining the 
 effusion prior to pemetrexed administration.</p><p>
 due to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe 
 dehydration has been observed. therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and 
 appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment.</p><p>
 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been 
 uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination 
 with another cytotoxic agent. most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had pre-
 existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. as a result, concomitant use of live attenuated 
 vaccines (except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</p><p>
 pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. sexually mature males are advised not to father a 
 child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. contraceptive measures or abstinence are 
 19 recommended. owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed 
 (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, 
 during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy.</p><p>particular attention should be paid to these patients 
 and caution exercised with use of other radiosensiting agents.</p><p>
 cases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years 
 previously.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by glomerular filtration. concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside, loop 
 diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of 
 pemetrexed. this combination should be used with caution. if necessary, creatinine clearance should 
 be closely monitored.</p><p>
 concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) 
 could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. caution should be made when these drugs 
 are combined with pemetrexed. if necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored.</p><p>
 in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal 
 anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg/day) and aspirin at higher dosage 
 (&gt; 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the occurrence of 
 pemetrexed adverse events. therefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of 
 nsaids or aspirin at higher dosage, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function 
 (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min). 
 in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the 
 concomitant administration of pemetrexed with nsaids (e.g. ibuprofen) or aspirin at higher dosage 
 should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration 
 (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in the absence of data regarding potential interaction with nsaids having longer half-lives as 
 piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 
 5 days prior to, on the day, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. results from 
 in vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition 
 of the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolised by cyp3a, cyp2d6, cyp2c9, and cyp1a2.</p><p>
 interactions common to all cytotoxics:</p><p>
 due to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is 
 frequent. the high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the 
 possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased 
 frequency of inr (international normalised ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with 
 oral anticoagulants. 
 concomitant use contraindicated: yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see 
 section 4.3). 
 concomitant use not recommended: live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever): risk of systemic, 
 possibly fatal, disease. the risk is increased in subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their 
 underlying disease. use an inactivated vaccine where it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4).</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>20 there are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other anti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. 
 animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). pemetrexed should not be used 
 during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and 
 the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. 
 pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. sexually mature males are advised not to father a 
 child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. contraceptive measures or abstinence are 
 recommended. owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men 
 are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</p><p>
 it is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the suckling 
 child cannot be excluded.</p><p>breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed therapy</p><p>(see

 23 clinically relevant grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory toxicities were similar between integrated phase 2 results from three single agent pemetrexed studies (n = 164) and the phase 3 single agent pemetrexed 
 study described above, with the exception of neutropenia (12.8 % versus 5.3 %, respectively) and

 alimta (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by 
 disrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.</p><p>
 in vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (ts), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
 formyltransferase (garft), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the 
 de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate 
 carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly 
 and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. the 
 polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of ts and garft. 
 polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a 
 lesser extent, in normal tissues. polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life 
 resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy:</p><p>
 emphacis, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of alimta plus cisplatin versus 
 cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated 
 with alimta and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over 
 patients receiving cisplatin alone.</p><p>
 during the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin b
 12 supplementation was introduced to patients’ therapy to reduce toxicity. the primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all 
 patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug (randomised and treated). a 
 subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin b
 12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented). the results of these analyses of 
 efficacy are summarised in the table below:</p><p>

 2. in vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. binding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. pemetrexed undergoes 
 limited hepatic metabolism. pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the 
 administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following 
 administration. pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from 
 plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). 
 between patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. pemetrexed total systemic exposure

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what alimta is and what it is used for</header><p>alimta is a medicinal product used in the treatment of cancer.</p><p>
 alimta is a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma, which is given in combination with 
 cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine, to patients who have not received prior chemotherapy.</p><p>
 alimta is also a treatment for the advanced stage of non-small cell lung cancer after other 
 chemotherapy has been used.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you are given alimta
   you should not be given alimta:</header><p>-</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of alimta. 
 -</p><p>
 if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with alimta. 
 -</p><p>
 if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever.</p></section><section><header>take special care with alimta:</header><p>if you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive alimta. 
 before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
 kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive alimta. your 
 doctor may decide to change the dose or put off treating you depending on your general condition and 
 if your blood cell counts are too low. if you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure 
 that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to 
 prevent vomiting.</p><p>
 if you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor.</p><p>
 if you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor.</p><p>

 treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. you may want to seek counselling on sperm 
 storage before starting your therapy.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as medicines called “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” (nsaids), including medicines purchased 
 without a doctor’s prescription (such as ibuprofen). there are many sorts of nsaids with different 
 durations of activity. based on the planned date of your infusion of alimta and/or on the status of 
 your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you 
 can take them. if you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are nsaids.</p><p>
 please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
 medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy</header><p>if you are pregnant, or thinking about becoming pregnant,</p></section><section><header>tell your doctor</header><p>. the use of alimta should be avoided during pregnancy. your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of taking

 body surface area to work out the right dose for you.</p><p> this dosage may be adjusted, or treatment may 
 be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. a hospital pharmacist, 
 nurse or doctor will have mixed the alimta powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution 
 for injection before it is given to you.</p><p>
 you will always receive alimta by infusion into one of your veins. the infusion will last 
 approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>
 when using alimta in combination with cisplatin: 
 the doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. 
 cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after 
 the infusion of alimta has finished. the infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours.</p><p>
 you should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks.</p><p>
 additional medicines: 
 corticosteriods: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of 
 dexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day 
 after alimta treatment. this medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin 
 reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment.</p><p>

 must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of alimta. you will also receive 
 an injection of vitamin b
 12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of alimta and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of alimta treatment). vitamin b

 1.</p><p>use aseptic techniques during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for 
 intravenous infusion administration.</p><p>
 2.</p><p>calculate the dose and the number of alimta vials needed. each vial contains an excess of 
 pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of the label amount.</p><p>
 3.</p><p>alimta 100 mg: 
 reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for 
 injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. 
 alimta 500 mg: 
 reconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for 
 injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed.</p><p>
 gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. the resulting solution is clear 
 and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting 
 product quality. the ph of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8.</p></section><section><header>further dilution is required</header><p>.</p><p>
 4.</p><p>the appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution should be further diluted to 
 100 ml with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %)</p><p>sodium chloride solution for injection, without preservative, and 
 administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes.</p><p>
 5.</p><p>pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl 
 chloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags.</p><p>
 6.</p><p>parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
 discolouration prior to administration. if particulate matter is observed, do not administer.</p><p>
 7.</p><p>pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. any unused product or waste material should be 
 disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</p></section><section><header>preparation and administration precautions:</header><p>as with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. the use of 
 gloves is recommended. if a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and 
 thoroughly with soap and water. if pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush 
 thoroughly with water. pemetrexed is not a vesicant. there is not a specific antidote for extravasation 
 of pemetrexed. there have been a few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not 
 assessed as serious by the investigator. extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as 
 with other non-vesicants.</p></section></body></xml>
