 submission of the dossier</header><p>the applicant kite pharma eu b.v. submitted on 9 january 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to the european medicines agency (ema) for tecartus, through the centralised procedure falling within the article 
 3(1) and point 1a of annex of regulation (ec) no 726/2004. the eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
 agreed upon by the ema/chmp on 31 may 2018. 
 tecartus, was designated as an orphan medicinal product eu/03/19/2220 on 13 november 2019 in the following 
 condition: treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. 
 tecartus was granted eligibility to prime on 1 june 2018 in the following indication: treatment of adult patients 
 with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. 
 eligibility to prime was granted at the time in view of the following: 
 • mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive and incurable subtype of b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma. although most cases are initially sensitive to chemotherapy, relapse and progressive chemoresistance 
 are the rule in advanced stages. currently available therapy for patients with relapsed mcl results in cr 
 rates of 19% in patients who had failed ibrutinib therapy. although the introduction of novel agents (e.g. 
 imids, temsirolimus and, in particular, btk inhibitors such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib) has improved 
 the outcomes of subjects with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mcl, the available therapies (with the possible 
 exception of hsct) do not have a curative intent, and prolonging pfs and symptoms palliation remain 
 the main goals of treatment. the unmet medical need can therefore be agreed.</p><p>
 • despite the overall limited data and models’ limitations, the non-clinical data package may be overall considered a sufficient proof-of-concept to address the product potential to treat cd19 expressing 
 onco-haematological malignancies such as r/r mcl.</p><p>
 • limited but promising clinical data have been provided from 28 subjects treated with kte-c19 (xlp process) in cohort 1 in zuma-2 after failing a btk inhibitor. in particular, the reported orr (86%), cr 
 rate (54%) and estimated 9-month dor and os rates (69.9% and 83.7%, respectively) observed in a 
 heavily pre-treated population already exposed to ibrutinib should be regarded with interest, since the 
 currently available literature data seem to point toward median os ranging from 2.9 to 5.8 months after 
 failure of btk inhibitors (martin p et al, blood 2016).</p><p>
 the applicant applied for the following indication: tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
 relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl)</p><p>
 following the chmp positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the committee for orphan medicinal 
 products (comp) reviewed the designation of tecartus as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
 indication. more information on the comp’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance assessment report 
 published under the ‘assessment history’ tab on the agency’s website:

 disease or condition</header><p>the present centralised marketing authorisation application concerns the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (mcl).</p><p>
 the agreed indication for the product is:</p><p>tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a bruton’s 
 tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitor. 
 mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is an aggressive subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) with distinctive clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics {fakhri 2017, national comprehensive cancer network 2018}</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology</header><p>mcl accounts for approximately 6% of all new cases of nhl in the united states (us) (leukemia &amp; lymphoma society 2014) and 5% to 7% of malignant lymphoma in western europe (dreyling 2017b). the estimated 
 annual incidence of mcl is approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 persons in the us and europe (dreyling 2017b, fu 
 2017). mcl is more likely to affect men than women (vose 2017), and the median age at diagnosis is 68 years 
 (fakhri 2017)</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 biologic features</header><p>the lymphoma cells in mcl are thought to originate from antigen-naive pre-germinal centre b cells within the mantle zone of the lymph node and typically express the surface markers cd19, cd20, cd22, cd43, cd79a, 
 fmc7, cd5, surface immunoglobulin (ig) m, and surface igd (dreyling 2014) but not cd11c and cd10 (kraus 
 2010). the molecular hallmark of mcl is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which results in 
 overexpression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin d1. in addition to cell cycle dysregulation, aberrant cyclin d1 
 expression also results in alterations in the dna damage response pathway and activation of cell survival 
 pathways, both of which contribute to mcl pathogenesis (jares 2012). independent of cyclin d1 expression, the 
 transcription factor sex determining region y-box 11 (sox11) may be used as a diagnostic marker for the rare 
 cases of mcl that are cyclin d1-negative (narurkar 2016, sander 2016).</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 13/131</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.  
 clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>according to the who 2016 update, mcl has been categorised in two major subgroups with distinct clinical and molecular features: nodal mcl and leukemic non-nodal mcl. 
 prognosis varies based on clinical and laboratory parameters. early stage disease (staged i-ii) is defined by 
 involvement of one or two lymph node regions (or extranodal sites) localised on the same side of the diaphragm. 
 patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease (stage iii or iv). stage iii-iv disease is characterised by 
 involvement of lymph nodes or lymphoid regions on both sides of the diaphragm or diffuse extralymphatic organ 
 involvement. often, the primary diagnosis is advanced disease (stage iii/iv), present with lymphadenopathy 
 and extranodal involvement of the blood, bone marrow, and spleen; the gastrointestinal tract is also reported to 
 be involved in 15% to 30% of patients.</p><p>
 prognostic indexes help predict long-term outcomes for this disease in treatment-naive patients. the mantle cell 
 lymphoma international prognostic index (mipi) uses 4 independent factors (age, eastern cooperative 
 oncology group [ecog] performance status, blood lactate dehydrogenase, and leukocyte count) to stratify 
 front-line patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prognostic groups based on their overall survival (os) 
 status. after a median follow-up of 32 months, these groups had median os values of not reached, 51 months, 
 and 29 months, respectively (hoster 2008). the authors who developed the mipi also created the simplified 
 mipi (s-mipi), which can be derived without a calculation. the mipi and s-mipi can be supplemented with the 
 ki-67 proliferative index, which offers additional discriminatory power (geisler 2010, hoster 2008).</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header><p>current frontline therapy options the current standard of care for first-line treatment depends on the stage of mcl, the patients’ age, the 
 symptoms and the tumour burden. frontline therapy includes autologous stem cell therapy, mainly reserved for 
 patients 
 ≤ 65 years of age, and different therapy regimens such as r-chop, r-dhap and br. frontline therapy for mcl has evolved over the past decade, and overall response rates (orr) of up to 94% and complete 
 response (cr) rates of up to 40% have been achieved with first-line therapies. however, despite high orr, the 
 majority of patients will relapse, and outcomes in the relapsed setting are much poorer. recent studies have 
 shown a median os of 5 to 7 years in patients with earlier stages of disease (martin et al, 2009; herrmann et al, 
 2009), but median os of approximately 10 to 13 months in patients who have progressed after chemotherapy 
 and targeted agents (martin et al, 2014).</p><p>
 current treatment options in the relapsed and refractory situation 
 in the r/r situation in mcl, a repeated biopsy is recommended to identify important prognostic features and 
 individual therapy options (dreyling et al, annals of oncology, 2017). the treatment concepts comprise 
 immunochemotherapy followed by autologous/allogeneic sct, btk inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib; both 
 approved in the us; only ibrutinib is approved in the eu), the immunomodulatory (and thalidomide analogue) 
 agent lenalidomide, the m-tor inhibitor temsirolimus and the bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax. bortezomib is 
 approved in the eu for use in combination with r-chop for the treatment of newly diagnosed mcl, and it has 
 also been investigated as a monotherapy in relapsed/refractory mcl.</p><p>
 responses to asct in relapse are inferior to those in first-line and there is no consensus on the benefit of its use 
 in relapsed/refractory disease (ketterer et al, 1997; robinson et al, 2015). by contrast, allo-sct has the 
 potential to be curative in relapse/refractory mcl (vose 2015). in a recent review of 7 single-institution and</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 14/131 
 registry studies of patients with relapsed or refractory mcl, rajabi and colleagues (rajabi and sweetenham 2015) reported that approximately 25% of patients could achieve durable remissions with allo-sct treatment if 
 their disease was demonstrated to be chemosensitive prior to transplant. these studies included patients who 
 had previously undergone asct. however, they also reported high treatment-related mortality rates of up to 
 40% following allo-sct, primarily due to graft-versus host disease, and the majority of patients still did not 
 achieve durable remissions. 
 maintenance regimens with rituximab in the r/r situation have a favourable safety profile and prolong pfs and 
 os, however, second-line maintenance in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance is not recommended 
 which implies a restriction of a therapeutically approach in the r/r situation of mcl a priori.</p><p>
 despite promising high rates of orr (68%) for btk inhibitors (ibrutinib smpc) in the relapsed setting, they are 
 not considered as curative treatments since all patients will eventually have progressive disease after receiving 
 a btk inhibitor. subsequent to the approval of ibrutinib in the us, rule and colleagues published a pooled 
 analysis of 370 subjects with r/r mcl who received ibrutinib across 3 studies after 2 to 5 prior therapy lines 
 (phase 2 spark, phase 3 ray, and phase 2 pcyc-1104). collectively, these subjects initially had a median 
 follow-up of 24 months (rule 2017) and later of 3.5 years in a follow-up study (rule 2019). the orr and cr 
 rates for all subjects were 70% and 27%, respectively, but the median range for dor was 3 to 5.8 months, and 
 for os 2.5 to 9 months (dreyling et al on behalf of esmo guidelines committee, annals of oncology, volume 28, 
 jul 2017).</p><p>
 although the clinical outcome at mcl generally improved in the last years, the r/r situation and disease progress 
 during or after treatment with btk inhibitors mean a rather limited further treatment options for the patient. 
 thus, novel therapy strategies resulting in durable response rates are required.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>tecartus is a gene therapy medicinal product containing autologous t cells genetically modified</p><p> whereby a patient’s own t cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral transduction using an mscv 
 based gamma-retroviral vector to express a car comprising an anti-cd19 single chain variable fragment (scfv) 
 linked to cd28 co-stimulatory domains and cd3-zeta signalling domain . the transduced anti-cd19 car t cells 
 are expanded ex vivo and infused back into the patient, where they can recognise and eliminate cd19 
 expressing target cells.</p><p>
 tecartus binds to cd19 expressing cancer cells. following anti-cd19 car t cell engagement with cd19 
 expressing target cells, the cd28 co-stimulatory domain and cd3-zeta signalling domain activate downstream 
 signaling cascades that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of 
 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of cd19 
 expressing target cells. 
 tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) 
 after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a bruton’s tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitor.</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>the chmp and cat agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was</p><p>considered to be of major public health interest. this was based on the fact that currently patients with r/r mcl 
 have only limited treatment options with insufficient clinical outcome. an unmet medical need was substantiated</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 15/131 
 by the applicant and is acknowledged. data were presented to support that tecartus may address that unmet need.</p><p>though limited clinical data were available at the time of the accelerated assessment request, yet the 
 promising orr and cr rate observed so far, and the possibility for long-term disease control suggest that 
 tecartus might indeed represent a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies. 
 however, during assessment the cat and chmp concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
 accelerated assessment, as the proposed indication did not fully correspond to the patients treated in clinical 
 trials and since the data set was not considered comprehensive and the applicant had to provide a justification 
 to support consideration of the application for conditional approval.</p><p>
 in light of the concerns raised during assessment on the comprehensiveness of the data set, the applicant 
 requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with article 
 14-a of the above mentioned regulation, based on the fulfilment of following requirements, as presented by the 
 applicant: 
 • the benefit-risk balance is positive. • it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post-approval measures:</p><p>•</p><p>long-term follow-up data from zuma-2: in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of 
 tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl the mah shall submit the 24 months 
 follow-up data from the mitt population enrolled in the pivotal study zuma-2. expected date for 
 submission of the final data is 31 march 2022 
 •</p><p>a registry-based study:in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult 
 patients with relapsed or refractory mcl and the benefit/risk balance in the female, elderly and 
 severely diseased patients, the mah shall submit the results of a study investigating efficacy and 
 safety based on data from the same registry used to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety 
 of tecartus, according to an agreed protocol. expected date for submission of the final data is 30 
 september 2025. these post authorisation studies will provide further efficacy and safety 
 information on important subgroups: elderly, females, patients with severe disease which are not 
 fully represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. the provision of this data post 
 authorisation will complement the dossier in order have a more comprehensive understanding of 
 efficacy, safety and benefit risk balance of the product. 
 • an existing unmet medical need will be addressed, as an additional and novel therapeutic option is given for patients with r/r mcl after having received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy including a 
 btk-inhibitor. patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory or who relapsed after two or more 
 lines of approved systemic therapy including bruton’s kinase inhibitors have an overall poor prognosis 
 as few authorised treatment options with established efficacy and safety remain. usually, patients are 
 treated by therapy regimens or modifications thereof, they have already received and on which they 
 have relapsed at some point. tecartus provides a treatment option for which a significant clinical 
 benefit was demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of 
 response. thus, the availability of tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage. 
 • the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. as benefit-risk on basis of the current data is regarded positive, an 
 additional therapeutic option for mantle cell lymphoma patients with two or more previous systemic 
 therapies is considered beneficial.</p></section><section><header>the development programme/compliance with chmp guidance/scientific advice</header><p> chmp assessment report</p><p>

 the clinical development programme for tecartus consists of four ongoing, uncontrolled clinical studies. the primary data for this marketing authorisation application come from one single, uncontrolled, open label 
 multicentre phase 2 clinical study, kte-c19-102 (zuma-2) evaluating safety and efficacy of tecartus in patients 
 whose disease had relapsed or progressed on anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an 
 anti-cd20 antibody, and a btk inhibitor (ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib). the remaining three ongoing studies 
 are phase i/ii trials, intended to provide clinical experience of tecartus in the context of other indications. 
 the applicant received protocol assistance from the chmp on: 
 23.07.2015 - focusing on quality and the clinical study design of zuma-2 [procedure number: 
 emea/h/sa/3117/1/2015/sme/adt/ii] 
 -</p><p>the target patient population of adult subjects with r/r mcl was considered acceptable. the applicant 
 was advised to also include some patients refractory to protease inhibitors (pi) and/or immune 
 modulators (imid). this advice was followed. 
 -</p><p>the objective response rate as a primary efficacy endpoint was considered acceptable in a 
 non-comparative study. the use of independent endpoint assessment committee was recommended 
 and implemented.</p><p>
 17.12.2015 - focusing on the quality and nonclinical development program [procedure number: 
 emea/h/sa/3117/4/2015/sme/adt/iii] 
 -</p><p>scientific advice considered that the manufacturing procedure for kte-x19 is particular due to an 
 enrichment of cd4 and cd8 cells.</p><p>
 -</p><p>scientific advice considered that the proposed potency assay could potentially be considered a relevant 
 test of the potency of kte-x19 at the present stage of development. however, additional validation, 
 correlation and characterisation data would be needed to support the conclusion that the proposed 
 potency assay could provide a quantitative measure of the biological activity. 
 -</p><p>the provided rcr (replication competent retrovirus) testing has been performed on the mcb, wcb, and 
 used vector stock, and the omission of rcr testing was clearly justified with data at marketing 
 authorisation application. scientific advice considered it might be acceptable not to perform rcr testing 
 on the finished product.</p><p>
 -</p><p>scientific advice considered that the proposed release specifications should be considered expanded. 
 31.05.2018 - focusing on the nonclinical development program as well as the clinical study design of zuma-3 
 (investigating acute lymphoblastic leukemia [all]) [procedure number: emea/h/sa/3117/6/2018/pa/adt/iii]</p><p>
 -</p><p>in vitro data addressing the transduction efficiency and functionality of kte-x19 were required for maa. such 
 in vitro data conducted with axicabtagene ciloleucel (yescarta)) were not considered as sufficient, since kte-x19 and axicabtagene ciloleucel (yescarta) use a different manufacturing process and 
 therefore the two products were not considered the same. 
 -</p><p>the assumed historical control rate of 25% orr, was not considered sufficiently compelling. 
 furthermore, there were concerns that the cut-off could not be considered an a priori decision as the 
 meta-analysis conducted to support the cut-off was finalised after the efficacy data for the first 28 
 patients had been analysed. for the maa, the applicant was requested to provide information 
 concerning the search protocol for the meta-analysis as well as information on how heterogeneity 
 between studies affected the estimation of the pooled orr. this request was not followed.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 - the influence of both bridging therapy and conditioning therapy should be carefully considered in the 
 evaluation of the data. 
 -</p><p>the inferential analysis set was not endorsed as a primary analysis population. this advice was not 
 followed. however, results for both the inferential- and the full analyses set were generally presented in 
 the maa.</p><p>
 29.05.2019 - focusing on the quality and clinical development program for the treatment of mcl [procedure

 the applicant received scientific advice given by chmp with respect to vector quality and the transduction step. 
 the data confirm that the specification of the vector titre is acceptable. 
 the applicant plans to introduce improvements to the vector process, i.e. after the planned submission of the 
 tecartus maa. the overall strategy to improve vector quality was in essence endorsed, and the proposed

 regarding quality aspects, the applicant has taken the recommendations given by chmp into consideration.</p><p>
 during protocol assistance received in december 2015 and in may 2018 the process characterisation studies 
 addressing several parameters of the viral transduction step, the acceptability of the developmental activities to

 operating ranges and/or acceptance limits.</p><p>
 the pg13-cd19-h3 vector is produced constitutively from a stably-transduced pg13 (atcc crl-10686) cell 
 line. for the gmp-compliant production of the retroviral vector, cells from a single vial of wcb are expanded and 
 the culture supernatant is harvested, filtered and filled into cryostorage bags.</p></section><section><header>control of materials (pg13-cd19-h3 retroviral vector)</header><p>the packaging cell clone is based on a cell line that is commonly used to generate retroviral vector particles by introducing a γ-retroviral transfer vector of interest. these nih3t3- derived cells stably express the gibbon ape 
 leukemia virus (galv) envelope and the moloney murine leukemia virus (momlv) gag-pol proteins. 
 stable transfer of the pg13-cd19 transfer vector and subsequent selection of the cell clone were conducted at 
 the national cancer institute (nci, bethesda, maryland, us). the respective mcb and the wcb are established 
 in compliance with gmp. the mcb was tested and released based on ich q5a (r1). a single vial of the 
 pg13-cd19-car-h3 mcb was used to produce vials of wcb. the wcb has been shown to be free of bacterial, 
 fungal and mycoplasma contamination in compliance with ich q5a (r1) and ph. eur. (5.2.3). the wcb was also 
 found to be negative for replication-competent retrovirus. the genetic stability of the wcb and 
 end-of-production (eop) has been investigated. the test method and results are adequately described. overall 
 the testing strategy and characterisation of the cell banks is considered adequate. conformation for the 
 presence of the vector sequence in the wcb is currently not specified as a release test, but respective pcr data 
 confirming the presence of the vector sequences in the wcb have been provided and a respective test will be 
 implemented for each new wcb that is established.</p><p>
 the sequence of the viral transfer vector has been determined for different genome regions at the level of

 page 20/131 
 characterisation of the pg13-cd19-h3 vector included both structural and functional aspects. studies demonstrated that the pg13-cd19-h3 vector encodes the transgene. transduction results in integration of the 
 vector genome into the genome of the t-cells. the transgene is transcribed to rna and translated to anti-cd19 
 car. anti-cd19 car t-cells bind to cd19 expressing cells. upon engagement with cd19, t-cells are activated 
 and secrete ifn-γ. t. 
 impurities identified were host cell protein, hc-dna, bsa and the viral vector protein p30. additionally, vector 
 purity was evaluated as a ratio of genome copies per transducing unit. each harvest of pg13-cd19-h3 vector is 
 considered a unique lot, and testing is conducted to assure sterility, while safety tests for mycoplasma, 
 adventitious virus and replication competent retrovirus (rcr) are performed only on material in the last harvest 
 from the production campaign. the last harvest is considered a worst-case condition and testing at this stage 
 assures that the entire production campaign remains free of adventitious agents and that replication competent 
 retrovirus is not present.</p></section><section><header>specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container closure (pg13-cd19-h3 retroviral vector)</header><p>the applicant provided a justification for setting of specifications mainly based on manufacturing experience. with respect to infectious titre and impurities, the applicant confirmed with batch data from the different harvest 
 days, that harvest day has no impact on vector quality with respect to the impurity profile. 
 the vector undergoes testing for adventitious agents prior to release for use in production of kte-x19. and were 
 shown to be negative up to date. in addition, a risk evaluation regarding potential generation of rcr during 
 manufacture of the final product has been provided and the occurrence of rcr during manufacturing of tecartus 
 considered unlikely.</p><p>
 the analytical procedures used for release testing of pg13-cd19-h3 vector have been validated or verified as 
 appropriate. validation of the non-compendial analytical methods were performed in accordance with ich 
 q2(r1). verification of the compendial analytical methods for sterility, endotoxin and mycoplasma are 
 performed in accordance with ph. eur. summaries of the validation and verification reports for each method are 
 provided. 
 batch analysis data are available for lots of pg13-cd19-h3 vector manufactured and released in accordance 
 with cgmp. 
 the analytical methods for pg13-cd19-h3 vector produce quantitative results.</p></section><section><header>stability (pg13-cd19-h3 retroviral vector)</header><p>the stability of the pg13-cd19-h3 vector is being evaluated via long-term studies. in addition, the stability of pg13-cd19-h3 vector stored at either accelerated or stress (room temperature) conditions has been evaluated. 
 all studies were conducted in accordance with ich q5c quality of biotechnological products: stability testing of 
 biotechnological/biological products.</p><p>
 long-term stability studies are ongoing with eight lots of pg13-cd19-h3 vector stored at the recommended 
 storage temperature. these studies are being conducted with two lots used for clinical production, two lots used 
 for process validation (pv) and potential commercial production, and four lots designated for commercial

 pg13-cd19-h3 vector was exposed to elevated temperature to support potential temperature excursions that may occur during long term storage or during transportation. samples from three lots of pg13-cd19-h3 vector 
 were stored.</p><p>
 based on available long-term and accelerated stability data for vector pg13-cd19-h3, the proposed shelf-life of 
 and is considered acceptable. updated stability results for the retroviral pg13-cd19-h3 vector are provided. 
 stress testing of vector pg13-cd19-h3 at room-temperature was performed. this data confirm that the vector 
 particles are sensitive to increased temperature. during the manufacturing of kte-x19, the vector supernatant 
 is incubated before adding of cells for the transduction step. the pre-incubation step does slightly lower the 
 infectivity of the vector particles, as indicated by the calculation provided by the applicant considering a vector. 
 the applicant provided data of a comprehensive binding study, confirming that the number of vector particles 
 bound at or below the lower titre specification results in a sufficient transduction rate. these data confirm that 
 the established transduction step results into the binding of a sufficient amount of vector particle. the applicant 
 clarified that the vector is thawed, the maximal hold time after thawing, which is considered adequate.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2. part 2: active substance kte-x19 general information (kte-x19)</header><p>the active substance comprised in tecartus contains autologous t-cells transduced ex vivo with a replication-deficient γ-retroviral vector containing an anti-cd19 chimeric antigen receptor (car). cd19 is a 95 
 kda transmembrane protein selectively expressed in both normal and malignant b cells. cars are fusion 
 proteins with antigen binding, transmembrane, and t-cell activation domains that, when expressed in t-cells, 
 can target tumour antigens through t-cell mediated killing.</p><p>
 the car target binding domain is a single chain variable region fragment (scfv) derived from the fmc63 
 monoclonal antibody (mab). the antigen-binding domain of the anti-cd19 car construct encompasses the 
 following domains:</p><p>
 • the fmc63 antibody light chain variable domain (complementary determining regions [cdr] 1 and 2);</p><p>• a peptide linker; • the fmc63 antibody heavy chain variable domain (cdr1, cdr2, and cdr3). comparative analysis demonstrated that the specificity of the scfv was equivalent to that of the original fmc63 
 mab.</p><p>
 a membrane proximal extracellular domain of the co-stimulatory receptor cd28 joins the scfv to a cd28 
 transmembrane domain and functions as a “hinge.” an intracellular signalling domain of cd28 connects the 
 extracellular scfv portion with the intracellular cd3ζ portion at the terminus of the car construct. the cd3ζ and 
 co-stimulatory cd28 domains are signalling following car engagement to induce t-cell activation, proliferation, 
 and acquisition of effector functions.

 following the formulation step, the final product bag containing tecartus is aseptically sealed and transferred to 
 a cassette for cryopreservation. for the cryopreservation process step, temperature profiles for yescarta that 
 showed consistency in the freeze cycle was used for tecartus final products. in tecartus stability studies, 
 however, smaller bags of identical material are used. cryopreservation of one or two product bags was 
 comparable. transfer between the crf and storage in ln2 is performed using a cryopod (portable ln2 
 vapor-based carrier). comparable temperature profiles for freezing have been demonstrated. 
 two primary container closure systems consisting of the same material (eva) are used. characterisation studies 
 were performed with yescarta material, which is acceptable taking into account the similarities of the two

 ppq lots, healthy donor lots and lots from clinical subjects have been placed in long-term stability studies. lots from clinical subjects are derived from patients that have dropped off the clinical trial. commercial and 
 “protocol” acceptance criteria are intermittently used in the presentation of stability data due to evolving of the 
 release acceptance criteria based on the progress made in process development. 
 the presented long-term stability results from clinical patient lots of tecartus, stored at the recommended 
 storage condition are within the “protocol” acceptance criteria for most of the results of the ten lots. the results 
 suggest that clinical patient lots stored at the recommended storage condition remain viable for months.</p><p>
 ppq and post-ppq healthy donor stability studies have been tested at release to demonstrate product stability 
 according to “protocol” acceptance criteria. all results met the acceptance criteria with the exception of four lots. 
 data on the investigation and corrective actions taken with regard to these lots have been provided. overall, the 
 results from the ppq batches are complex to trend for the various conditions investigated.</p><p>
 the applicant 
 provided the results from the ppq stability study in separate figures for each condition as requested. no trend in 
 the results was detected.</p><p>
 the claimed shelf life of 12 months when stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen (≤ -150°c) for the 
 tecartus final product in cryostorage bags is considered acceptable. tecartus must remain frozen until the 
 patient is ready for treatment to ensure viable live autologous cells are available for patient administration.</p><p>
 all results from accelerated studies were within the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. stress testing was 
 performed on tecartus lot with dose sourced from healthy donor material and stored. the suitability of tests to 
 be stability-indicating was confirmed. 
 in-use stability testing revealed that post-thawed tecartus lots are stable for 3 hours at room temperature 
 (20°c to 25°c). thawing instructions in the smpc indicate that tecartus infusion should begin within 30 minutes 
 of thaw completion time and total tecartus infusion time should not exceed 30 minutes. thawed product should 
 not be refrozen.

 in july 2020, chmp extended the call for review of nitrosamines impurities to all biologics. as a consequence, the 
 applicant committed to provide a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in tecartus 
 within six months of the marketing authorisation. in the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is 
 identified, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 
 a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. if nitrosamine impurities are

 primary pharmacodynamic studies</header><p>cd19 expression profile summary targeting b-lineage haematologic malignancies via cd19 is based on earlier findings demonstrating that 
 expression of cd19 is restricted to cells, both normal and malignant, of the b-lineage, including mantle cell 
 lymphoma (mcl) (leonard 2001). early publications by nadler and colleagues (nadler et al, 1983; anderson et 
 al, 1984) showed that cd19 protein is expressed on all b-lineage lymphoid cells, from the pro-b-cell maturation 
 stage to naïve and differentiated b cells. uckun and colleagues (uckun et al, 1988) confirmed and extended 
 these findings by demonstrating that leukemic progenitor b cells also express cd19, and that erythroid, 
 myeloid, megakaryocytoid, and multilineage normal bone marrow progenitor cells do not express cd19. more 
 recently, johnson and colleagues (johnson et al, 2009) showed that primary lymphoma cells from patients with 
 diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) expressed cd19, whereas reference t cells did not. olejniczak and 
 colleagues (olejniczak et al, 2006) examined the expression pattern and levels of cd19 in peripheral blood, 
 bone marrow, and lymph node tissue from patients with 6 different common b-cell malignancies (chronic 
 lymphocytic leukemia [cll], small lymphocytic lymphoma [sll], b-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia [all], 
 hairy cell leukemia [hcl], dlbcl, and follicular lymphoma [fl]). nearly all samples within each type were 
 considered positive for cd19. expression levels of cd19 were variable across the different b-cell malignancies, 
 but all b-cell malignancies examined showed consistently measurable levels of cd19 expression above 
 reference cd3
 + t cells.</p><p>other investigators have shown that cd19 is expressed in mcl (leonard et al., 2001; ginaldi et al. 1998; 
 cabezudo 1999; d’arena et al., 2000; marcondes et al., 2017;</p><p>yang et al., 2005;</p><p>argatoff et al., 1997). 
 demonstration of clinical activity of an anti-cd19 car in a chemotherapy-refractory mcl patient further

 in summary, evidence from key published literature demonstrates that cd19 is expressed on the surface of normal b-lineage cells as well as most b-cell malignancies, including mcl, a subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma 
 (nhl).</p><p>in vitro characterisation of anti-cd19-transduced human t cells for initial in vitro evaluation of specific activity against cd19+ target cells, the applicant used cd19 car t cells from patients that were enrolled in clinical trials conducted by the national cancer institute (nci). specific 
 activity of these anti-cd19 car t cells was evaluated and cytotoxicity upon binding of the cd19 car t cells to 
 its target antigen cd19. thereby, the specificity of the cd19-car t cells for its target antigen has been 
 confirmed by inclusion of appropriate negative controls, such as cd19
 - target cells, untransduced t cells and t cells transduced with a cd19-unrelated car construct (sp6-28z). cd19 car t cells from patients with advanced 
 b-cell haematologic malignancies manufactured at nci were used for evaluation of different cytokine, 
 chemokine, and effector molecule release upon co-culture with cd19
 + and cd19- target cells. therefore, a luminex
 tm analysis involving 17 analytes comprising markers for immune cell homeostasis and proliferation (il-2), pro-inflammatory activity (il-6, il-13, tnf-α, gm-csf), immune-modulating activity (il-4, il-5, il-10, 
 ifn-γ, cd137), chemokines (mip-1α, mip-1β), and effector molecules (granzyme a, granzyme b, soluble fas, 
 sfasl, perforin) has been performed.</p><p>the manufacturing processes used to generate the cd19 car t cells at nci, and subsequently axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel, are similar, but not equivalent, to the process used to manufacture kte-x19.</p><p>
 in vitro characterisation of anti-cd19 t cells generated by the kte-x19 manufacturing process using apheresis material from two healthy human donors, anti-cd19 car t cells were produced by a scaled-down kte-x19 manufacturing process and were characterised 
 in vitro. cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell activation, as measured by cell expansion (total number of cells), diameter, and viability were assessed on days 0, 1, 6, 9, 
 and 13. most of the cells were frozen on day 9 for subsequent functional characterisation studies while a small 
 proportion of cells were kept in culture for additional phenotypic car characterisation over time. upon 
 activation, t cells from both donors increased in mean cell diameter from day 0 to day 1 and expanded 393- and 
 155-fold for t cells from donor 1 and donor 2, respectively, between days 1 and 13. mean t-cell viability ranged 
 from 76.9% to 91.7% on all days measured (spanning days 0 to 13). transduction efficiency was monitored on 
 days 6, 9, 13, and 16 by flow cytometry using fluorophore-labelled, custom-made antibodies (kip-1 and kip-3) 
 that bind to the scfv region of the engineered car t cell. transduction was stable over time for t cells from both 
 donors. 
 in a separate study, anti-cd19 car t-cell products generated from apheresis material from 2 healthy human 
 donors from a scaled-down kte-x19 manufacturing process (described in the study above; harvested on day 9) 
 as well as an additional anti-cd19 car t-cell product generated by the at-scale kte-x19 manufacturing process 
 from apheresis material from another healthy human donor (harvested on day 6) were assessed functionally. 
 each of the 3 anti-cd19 car t-cell products were co-cultured with cd19
 + b-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (nalm6) target cells, cd19
 + b-cell lymphoma (raji) target cells, and cd19-knockout (raji cd19ko) target control cells. car t cells derived from all 3 donors proliferated approximately 80% in response to 
 co-culture with cd19
 + target cells at day 4 after co-culture initiation. by comparison, only homeostatic proliferation (approximately 10% to 20%) was observed with nontransduced t cells co-cultured with cd19
 + target cells. all 3 donor-derived anti-cd19 car t-cell products co-cultured overnight with cd19+ target cells resulted in measurable levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, and il-2 cytokine production. all three donor-derived anti-cd19 
 car t-cell products tested were cytotoxic to cd19

 controls (nontransduced t cells and/or cd19− target cells) demonstrated that proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity were specific to anti-cd19 car t cells and dependent on cd19 antigen engagement. 
 in vitro and in vivo activity of surrogate anti-murine cd19 car t cells since the anti-cd19 scfv utilised for kte-x19 does only recognise human cd19, a murine surrogate model was engineered for non-clinical proof-of-concept studies in immune competent mice. this surrogate model used an 
 anti-murine cd19 car construct that was similar to kte-x19 with the exception of the scfv, which has been 
 derived from the 1d3 mab recognizing murine cd19. murine t cells were transduced with the anti-murine cd19 
 car construct and adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice which underwent tbi at 5 gy for lymphodepletion 
 and were challenged with a cd19-expressing 38c13 lymphoma cell line to investigate the anti-lymphoma effect 
 of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells.</p><p>
 the administration of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells into the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model revealed 
 both the ability of the cd19 car t cells to prevent establishment of a lymphoma and to eradicate already 
 established lymphoma masses including metastasis. administration of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells in both 
 the prophylactic and the therapeutic setting resulted in prolonged survival of the mice while control animals 
 became rapidly moribund due to lymphoma and were euthanised. using the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, 
 the applicant also investigated the influence of total body irradiation (tbi) prior to the administration of the 
 lymphoma cells and the cd19 car t cells which revealed the importance of the tbi-induced lymphodepletion for 
 prolonged survival of these animals and thus for a successful outcome of the car t cell therapy. 
 in addition, the surrogate murine cd19 car t cells were investigated 
 in vitro for cd19-specific activation in co-cultures of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells and cd19

 products, ema/cat/80183/2014) conventional adme studies are not required. 
 although no formal non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies of kte-x19 were conducted, the persistence of 
 anti-murine cd19 car t cells was examined in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model using flow cytometry 
 analysis. results from this experiment showed that cd4
 +and cd8+anti-murine cd19 car t cells remained in the spleens of treated mice up to 1 week following injection. anti-murine cd19 car t cells were not detected in the 
 spleens of treated mice at day 63 after injection of car t cells; longer follow-up for anti-murine cd19 car t 
 cells was not examined. however, findings from other experiments showed that mice treated with anti-murine 
 cd19 car t cells remained free of leukaemia up to 209 days (the last time point examined) after receiving the 
 injection, suggesting that the anti-lymphoma effect was maintained long term. 
 no other non-clinical pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 toxicology</header><p>formal single-dose study in animals was not performed for kte-x19. kte-x19 is intended to be administered as a single infusion treatment therefore no repeat-dose toxicities study was conducted. in addition, due lack of 
 suitable animal model and applicability of traditional toxicology tests, non-clinical studies on safety 
 pharmacology, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and genotoxicity/carcinogenicity were also not 
 conducted. 
 the only safety aspects that were included in the non-clinical evaluation were: 
 • on-target/off-tumour toxicity of cd19 car t cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, and, • analysis of vector integration sites (vis) in car t cells at the end of the manufacturing process have been conducted with kte-x19 
 on-target/off-tumour toxicity of cd19 car t cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model has been evaluated 
 during the pharmacology study in parallel with the anti-lymphoma effect and the persistence of the anti-murine 
 cd19 car t cells. results showed that normal b cells (which are cd19
 +), were eliminated in mice treated with anti-murine cd19 car t cells, but could be detected at day 8 in mice treated with control car t cells. the 
 inhibition of normal b-cell development persisted in mice treated with anti-murine cd19 car t cells; lack of 
 normal splenic b cells was observed 63 days, 143 days, and 209 days (the last time point examined) after 
 anti-murine cd19 car t-cell infusion, whereas t cells had recovered to normal levels at the time point of 143 
 days from infusion. notably, this complete and prolonged absence of b cells was not accompanied by any 
 evidence of overt toxicity. the prolonged absence of b cells was unique to mice that were treated with 
 anti-murine cd19 car-transduced t cells, as control mice that received either 5 gy of tbi alone or 5 gy of tbi 
 followed by infusions of t cells expressing the sp6-28z.1-3 negative control car had detectable splenic b cells 
 4 to 8 days after irradiation. the observed prolonged depletion of normal b cells known to express cd19 
 confirmed the expected on-target/off-tumour effect of the cd19 car t cells on normal b cells. additional 
 toxicities of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells did not become evident in the pharmacology studies. 
 vis were assessed in car t cells manufactured from healthy donor t cells transduced with the retroviral vector 
 used for the manufacture of kte-x19. the data of this study were re-evaluated during the procedure using an 
 improved bioinformatics analysis method. thereby, the re-evaluation of the data revealed a considerably 
 increased number of total vis in all donors compared to the initial analysis, as well as lower numbers and 
 percentages of vis that were detected in more than 2 out of 5 aliquots analysed per donor. the vis analysis 
 revealed an even distribution across the chromosomes and the number of vis paralleled the number of 
 transcription start sites (tss) on each chromosome. thereby, the vector integrated non-randomly near active 
 tss of t-cell-related genes. 10.2% to 10.6% of the identified vis occurred within exons. the applicant 
 concluded from the vis analysis that no predominance of a single vis was apparent. this conclusion is based on 
 the probability of detecting a given vis in 3 or more aliquots investigated per donor, which ranged between 
 0.115%, 0.0403, and 0.0368% for donor 1, 2, and 3, respectively. the number of unique identified vis per 
 donor ranged between 51684 and 91093 sites. similarly, also the abundance of the top 100 vis by chromosomal 
 genomic coordinate per donor has been interpreted by the applicant as not revealing signs of 
 over-representation of single vis.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>the risk for the environment in general and for transmission to third parties associated with the genetically modified t cells is considered negligible, as genetically modified cells cannot survive in the environment. if

 infectious particles in kte-x19 will be reduced to negligible concentrations during manufacturing. moreover, the 
 absence of rcr has been confirmed at different stages of the manufacturing process. the applicant showed that 
 in clinical studies with kte-x19 no rcr has been detected in the blood of patients.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.6">2.3.6.  
 discussion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>pharmacology some of the presented non-clinical in vitro pharmacology studies were conducted with cd19 car t cells that were generated at the nci with a manufacturing process similar, but not fully equivalent to the kte-x19 
 process. in order to complete the pharmacology data package, additional non-clinical 
 in vitro pharmacology studies were conducted with cd19 car t cells manufactured using the kte-x19 process. thereby, the applicant 
 followed the recommendation of the chmp provided in a former protocol assistance of kte-x19. in addition to 
 the non-clinical 
 in vitro data that were conducted with cells from healthy donors generated using the kte-x19 manufacturing process, additional characterisation data for kte-x19 has been included in the quality part of the 
 dossier. these additional characterisation data revealed a similar transduction efficiency of kte-x19 cells 
 generated from healthy donors as compared to mcl patients. moreover, poly-functionality of kte-x19 has been 
 demonstrated in the quality part by measuring secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokines upon binding of 
 kte-x19 to cd19
 + target cells. overall, the provided non-clinical 
 in vitro data sufficiently demonstrate specific activity of kte-x19 against its target antigen cd19. moreover, poly-functionality of the car t cells at the end of the manufacturing process has 
 been demonstrated for the cells manufactured at nci using luminex
 tm analysis and for kte-x19 using mesoscale discovery
 ® (msd®) analysis. although these data are rather considered as characterisation data of the final product than non-clinical pharmacology data, they are still important as they support the versatile 
 capability of kte-x19 with regard to lymphocyte activation and effector mechanisms.</p><p> 
 in addition to the 
 in vitro evaluation of kte-x19, the applicant established murine surrogate cd19 car t cells for 
 in vivo evaluation in a syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. this approach provided important proof-of-concept for the overall design of the chosen cd19 car construct including for example the choice of the 
 co-stimulatory domain. such a surrogate model may also be considered as the most appropriate non-clinical 
 model for investigating the persistence of the cd19 car t cells and for evaluating potential 
 on-target/off-tumour effects of the car t cells. on the other hand, it is evident that crucial parameters of the 
 car t cell may differ between the murine surrogate cd19 car t cells and the human cd19 car t cells. this 
 includes for example the binding affinity of the scfv, the manufacturing of the transduced cells, and the 
 composition of t cell subsets. despite these expected differences, the use of murine surrogate cd19 car t cells</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 35/131 
 in immunocompetent mice is an acceptable approach that overcomes some of the limitations of the in vivo</p><p>testing of kte-x19 in immunocompromised animals (e.g. unspecific xenogeneic immune responses of kte-x19 in mice, lack of complex interactions of the car t cells with other components of the immune system). since 
 both models do have clear, although differing, limitations with regard to the translation of the non-clinical 
 pharmacology data to human, additional non-clinical 
 in vivo pharmacology data (e.g. testing of kte-x19 in immunocompromised animals transplanted with human cd19
 + tumour cells) would not add significant value to the available non-clinical and clinical pharmacology data sets. 
 absence of secondary pharmacodynamics studies, safety pharmacology studies and pharmacodynamic drug 
 interaction studies is acceptable based on the nature of the product and the limitations of the available animal 
 models, respectively. 
 pharmacokinetics the provided non-clinical pharmacokinetic investigations focused on the in vivo persistence of the murine surrogate car t cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, which is acceptable for this type of product. the 
 chosen model provides all necessary stimuli that are considered important for a specific activation, expansion, 
 and survival of the cd19 car t cells (e.g. cd19
 + target tumour cells, endogenous cytokines, chemokines and cellular interactions of a fully functional immune system). despite these ideal preconditions, the anti-murine 
 cd19 car t cells could only be detected in spleen at day 8, but no longer at day 63 post-infusion. thus, 
 persistence of cd19 car t cells could only be demonstrated for a short time period, despite a prolonged 
 anti-lymphoma effect and b-cell aplasia, which were evident for up to 209 days (the latest time point 
 investigated).</p><p>
 toxicology similar as the pharmacology evaluation, also the non-clinical safety evaluation of kte-x19 has been severely limited due to the lack of a relevant animal model. therefore, no glp-compliant formal toxicology studies were 
 performed. instead, the on-target/off-tumour effect on normal b cells was confirmed during the pharmacology 
 studies in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. this effect on normal b cells was expected based on the 
 expression pattern of cd19 and resulting b cell aplasia has been observed in both the syngeneic mouse 
 lymphoma model and in study participants that were treated with either axicabtagene ciloleucel or kte-x19 in 
 clinical trials. consequently, b cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia has been included in section 4.4 
 of the summary of product characteristics (spc). other toxic effects of anti-murine cd19 car t cells were not 
 evident in the mouse lymphoma model. however, off-target toxicities are also not expected to be reliably 
 detected in the surrogate mouse model, since off-target recognition of other antigens may differ between the 
 anti-human and anti-murine cd19 car t cells due to the different scfvs that were used in the cd19 car 
 constructs. similarly, the use of kte-x19 in immunocompromised mice would also not be expected to reliably 
 predict off-target effects, since potential differences of cross-recognition of unrelated antigens, differences of 
 antigen expression patterns, and differences in the 
 in vivo survival, activation and expansion of kte-x19 are expected to hamper detection of potential off-target effects in such a model. 
 in addition to these potential toxicities of the cd19 car t cells that are either dependent on the expression 
 pattern of the chosen target antigen (on-target/off-tumour toxicities) or on the cross-reactivity of the chosen 
 scfv with other non-target antigens (off-target toxicities), there are also expected risks that are associated with 
 the general mode of action of car t cells, such as uncontrolled t cell proliferation, tumour lysis syndrome (trs), 
 cytokine release syndrome (crs), neurotoxicity, and macrophage activation syndrome (mas). these toxic 
 effects have also not been investigated in non-clinical studies which is fully acceptable considering that these 
 effects are general effects of car t cells and that the extent of these expected toxicities are largely based on 
 patient-specific parameters such as the individual tumour load.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 36/131 
 the combination of both the use of a γ-retroviral vector with full-length viral long terminal repeats (ltrs) and the high proliferative potential of the transduced t cells provides a certain risk of insertional oncogenesis, which 
 has not been addressed beyond the analysis of vis in car t cells at the end of the manufacturing process. the 
 lack of additional data on insertional oncogenesis has been sufficiently justified by the applicant. the applicants’ 
 line of argumentation involves the following key arguments: 1) an exceptional high resistance of mature mouse 
 t cells against transformation induced by genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors as reported in the 
 literature; and 2) lack of reported cases of insertional oncogenesis in the clinical evaluation of kte-x19 itself, 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel, or t cells that were transduced with γ-retroviral vectors encoding other transgenes. 
 thereby, clinical experience with study participants that were treated with γ-retrovirally transduced t cells 
 engineered to express either a t cell receptor (tcr) or a car included up to 11 years of follow-up. taken 
 together, the experience so far with mouse and human t cells suggests that t cell transformation due to 
 genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors is a very rare event which cannot be completely ruled out, but may 
 be expected to occur at a particularly low frequency.</p><p>
 the non-clinical vis data revealed the expected vector integration pattern of γ-retroviral vectors, which are 
 known to preferentially integrate within close proximity of tss and near transcriptionally active genes due to the 
 open chromatin structure. in contrast, integration of the γ-retroviral vector into exons is relatively rare. in 
 addition, the applicant concluded that no signs of predominance of single vis have been observed. this 
 conclusion has been supported by re-evaluation of the data using an improved bioinformatics analysis method.</p><p>
 the lack of non-clinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is acceptable based on the type of 
 product, the expression pattern of the target antigen and the lack of a relevant animal model. the risk of 
 inadvertent germline transmission of the cd19 car construct has not been addressed by the applicant. 
 however, the</p><p>guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors, 
 emea/273974/2005 
 indicates that the risk of germline transmission associated with the administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal testing of human cells may be difficult 
 or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human genetically modified cells are not 
 recommended.</p><p>
 the smpc appropriately indicates the lack of non-clinical toxicology studies, carcinogenicity and genotoxicity 
 studies, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (see section 5.3. of the smpc). 
 ecotoxicology/environmental risk assessment the risk of rcr formation during manufacturing is considered negligible due to the absence of the majority of the parental retroviral sequence in the vector and the necessity of several independent recombination events for 
 the generation of a functional rcr. in addition, the applicant confirmed the lack of rcr in the vector harvest 
 using a suitable test method with an acceptable sensitivity. finally, the applicant provided data on rcr testing 
 from samples of patients treated with kte-x19 in order to demonstrate that no rcr has been detected in treated 
 patients. thus, the likelihood that rcr is administered to study participants and released into the environment 
 or transmitted to third parties is considered negligible.</p><p>

 conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>a limited non-clinical development package was provided for kte-x19. however, the type of product and the limitations of available animal models for investigating pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of 
 kte-x19 do not allow meaningful non-clinical investigation of many of the aspects that are usually required for 
 a gtmp. therefore, the presented non-clinical 
 in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating cd19 car expression on transduced t cells, specific activation of cd19 car t cells, 
 in vivo anti-lymphoma activity and persistence of the surrogate cd19 car t cells, b cell aplasia as an expected on-target/off-tumour effect, and the integration sites 
 analysis of the retroviral vector conducted at the end of the manufacturing process of the cd19 car t cells, can 
 be considered sufficient for marketing approval of kte-x19. 
 the product is considered as approvable from a non-clinical point of view. moreover, the risk for the environment 
 and human health is regarded as negligible.</p><p>

 carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of directive 2001/20/ec. 
 a routine gcp inspection was conducted for the clinical trial: a phase 2 multicenter study evaluating the efficacy 
 of kte-x19 in subjects with relapsed/ refractory mantle cell lymphoma (zuma-2). the purpose of the 
 inspection was to evaluate compliance with gcp and applicable regulations, in particular where it has impact on 
 the validity of the data or the ethical conduct of the trial. 
 the original inspection request included the sponsor and an investigator site in the us. the planned inspections 
 on site in the us were cancelled due to travel restrictions caused by covid-19 pandemic. the sponsor inspection 
 was conducted remotely and as a follow-up to the findings at sponsor, a cro inspection was included in the 
 procedure. the cro inspection was conducted on site in germany and partly remotely. 
 despite the findings observed by the inspection team, overall the trial was conducted ethically and the level of 
 compliance with gcp was sufficient to conclude that the data are of acceptable quality. 
 it is the general conclusion of the inspectors that the data reported in the csr submitted to the agency are 
 reliable and can be used for the assessment of the maa.</p></section><section><header>tabular overview of clinical studies</header></section><section><header>table 1:  clinical trials with kte-x19</header><p> chmp assessment report</p><p>

 notes: all data have units of cells/μl except auc0-28 is cells/μl•days and time to peak is measured in days. peak is defined as the maximum 
 number of car t cells measured after infusion. time to peak is defined as the number of days from kte-x19 infusion to the date when the car 
 t cells in blood first reached the maximum postbaseline level. auc0-28 is defined as the area-under-the-curve in a plot of number of car t cells 
 against scheduled visit from day 0 to day 28. due to the timing of samples collected immediately after infusion (day 7, day 14, and day 28), 
 the calculated values for peak, auc0-28, and time to peak are considered estimates.</p><p>
 a the number of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood (per µl) was calculated as (1,000 x white blood cell count/μl) x ([% monocyte + % lymphocyte count]/100) x (qppb/100), where qppb is the percentage of pmbcs that express the anti-cd19 car.</p><p>

 pk according to baseline tumour burden 
 tumour burden was measured per the revised guidelines from the international working group (iwg) response 
 criteria for malignant lymphoma (cheson 2014) and as the sum of the cross-products of target lesions. the 
 association of anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion with baseline tumour burden was assessed according to quartiles 
 of tumour burden. median anti-cd19 car t-cell peak values were 42.18 cells/μl in the first (lowest) tumour 
 burden quartile, 135.82 cells/μl in the second quartile, 133.00 cells/μl in the third quartile, and 48.11 cells/μl 
 in the fourth (highest) quartile. were 458.99 cells/μl•days in the first quartile, 1486.96 cells/μl•days in the 
 second quartile, 2168.29 cells/μl•days in the third quartile, and 566.27 cells/μl•days in the fourth quartile. 
 thus, a trend towards lower anti-cd19 car t-cell exposure for subjects with baseline tumour burden in the 
 highest quartile. 
 pharmacokinetics by mcl morphologic characteristics 
 seventeen subjects in cohort 1 and 6 subjects in cohort 2 (28% overall) had blastoid variant of mcl, which is 
 an aggressive subtype of mcl that may predict poorer prognosis than classical morphology mcl. subjects with 
 blastoid variant mcl showed reduced anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion and overall exposure compared with 
 subjects with classical mcl morphology (2- to 3-fold differences between median values)</p></section><section><header>exploratory analyses</header><p>correlative analyses of potential association of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters with key safety and efficacy endpoints were performed for cohort 1. for the correlative analyses described below,

 anti-cd19 car t-cell levels in blood (peak and auc0-28) were examined according to the severity of key safety outcomes (incidence of grade 3 or higher versus grade 2, grade 1, or no crs or neurologic events) data 
 collected on day 7 and day 14 were used to determine association of pharmacokinetic parameters with aes. 
 peak blood levels of anti-cd19 car t cells were higher for subjects with higher grades of crs. the median peak 
 level of anti-cd19 car t cells was 4.8-fold higher for subjects with grade 3 or higher crs compared with 
 subjects with grade 2, grade 1, or no crs (273.72 versus 57.07 cells/μl). median auc
 0-28 was 7.77-fold higher in subjects with grade 3 or higher crs than in subjects with grade 2, grade 1, or no crs (4664.32 versus 
 600.59 cells/μl•days).</p><p>
 the median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell level in blood was 8.27-fold higher in subjects with grade 3 or higher 
 neurologic events relative to the median peak level in subjects with grade 2, grade 1, or no neurologic events 
 (361.50 versus 43.71 cells/µl). similarly, the median auc
 0-28 was 9.46-fold higher in subjects with grade 3 or higher neurologic events than in subjects with grade 2, grade 1, or no neurologic events (4664.32 versus 
 493.16 cells/μl•days). summarizing, higher anti-cd19 car t-cell levels (peak and auc
 0-28) were associated with grade 3 or higher crs and grade 3 or higher neurologic events.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.  
 pharmacodynamics</header><p>for evaluation of pharmacodynamics, subjects’ serum samples were collected according to the zuma-2 clinical protocol schedule of assessments and per institutional guidelines at baseline (prior to conditioning 
 chemotherapy), on day 0 (after conditioning chemotherapy and prior to kte-x19 infusion), and on days 3, 7, 
 14, and 28 after the kte-x19 infusion. additional unscheduled samples were collected if a subject had prolonged 
 treatment-related toxicity or was re-admitted to the hospital with any kte-x19-related adverse event and at the 
 time of disease progression (optional). in addition, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was obtained from subjects who 
 experienced grade 2 or higher neurologic events after kte-x19 infusion and from subjects who consented to 
 optional lumbar punctures at baseline (prior to kte-x19 infusion) and day 5 (± 3 days) after kte-x19 infusion. 
 however, cerebrospinal fluid analyses were exploratory and descriptive in nature and the methods used were 
 not qualified for csf. 
 a total of 40 analytes has been evaluated on blood and tumour samples with 17 key analytes, which comprised 
 pro-inflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines, chemokines, and effector molecules. the analysis of 
 primary biomarkers is performed on blood and tumour samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic 
 markers for anti-cd19 car t cells. prognostic markers specific for mcl and related to the tumour immune 
 environment are evaluated in archived and fresh tumour biopsies (at baseline, on day 7, and at month 6 for 
 subjects who sign the optional consent form). 
 the following 17 analytes were considered key analytes:</p><p>
 • homeostatic/proliferative: interleukin (il)-2, il-7, and il-15 • inflammatory/immune modulating: c-reactive protein (crp), interferon-gamma (ifn-γ), il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), il-2 receptor alpha (il-2rα), il-6, il-10, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α) 
 • chemokine: c-x-c motif chemokine (cxcl)10, and il-8 • immune effector: granzyme b and perforin • other analytes: ferritin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1)</p><p>
 key observations</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 48/131 
 after infusion of kte-x19, the serum levels of the key analytes remained steady at baseline levels (tnf-α and vcam-1) or were elevated relative to baseline (cxcl10, ferritin, granzyme b, icam-1, ifn-γ, il-1ra, il-2, 
 il-2rα, il-6, il-8, il-10, and perforin). crp levels generally decreased to baseline or below baseline at week 4. 
 three of 65 subjects (4.6%) still demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change in the level of crp over baseline at that 
 time. the median time to peak for all key analytes was within 8 days after infusion of kte-x19 (range of 
 medians: 4 to 8 days), preceding the peak anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion at 14 days; the median time to peak 
 for perforin was 22 days. the majority of analytes increased by 2-fold or more at peak in ≥ 50% of subjects 
 (exceptions: icam-1, perforin, tnf-α, and vcam-1). 
 association of pharmacodynamic parameters with crs or neurologic events 
 of the 17 key analytes, the median peak serum levels for the following were nominally higher (nominal wilcoxon 
 rank-sum p value 
 ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced grade 3 or higher crs versus grade 2, grade 1, or no crs after infusion of kte-x19: ferritin, granzyme b, il-2rα, il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, perforin, and tnf-α.</p><p>
 the 3 analytes with the lowest p values (highest statistical signal) for peak serum levels with grade 3 or higher 
 crs compared with grade 2, grade 1, or no crs were il-10, granzyme b and il-2ra.the 3 analytes with the 
 greatest fold change by grade of crs were il-6 (12.7-fold), il-10 (6.3-fold), and tnf-α (5.7-fold). 
 with the exception of perforin (median estimated time to peak of 22 days) , the median estimated time to 
 peak for all key analytes was within 8 days after infusion of kte-x19 (range of medians: 4 to 8 days), 
 preceding the peak anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion at 14 days. the majority of the analytes increased by 
 2-fold or more at peak in ≥ 50% of subjects (exceptions: icam-1, perforin, tnf-α, and vcam-1). by week 4 
 after kte-x19 infusion, the majority of the 17 key serum analytes had returned to near-baseline levels; ie, 6 
 analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (cxcl10, ferritin, ifn-γ, il 6, il-8, and 
 il-15). the monocyte chemokine protein 1 (mcp-1) as an important chemokine for cerebral immune 
 response and cerebral inflammation has been evaluated in the course of the trial. however, the observation 
 of mcp-1 peak levels at upper limit of quantification at both high and low grade neurologic events suggest the 
 use of a not quite adequate assay. therefore, unfortunately, the results cannot be regarded representative.</p><p>
 additionally, of the 40 analytes measured, 3 cytokines with the highest increases in peak and total exposure 
 in subjects with grade 3 or higher crs were granzyme a, gm-csf and macrophage inflammatory 
 protein-1alpha.</p><p>
 the results on upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the zuma 2 trial with higher grades of crs can be 
 regarded in line with literature data on other anti-cd19 car t cells. this also applies to the observation that by 
 week 4 after kte-x19 infusion, the majority of the 17 key serum analytes had returned to near-baseline levels; 
 i.e., six analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (cxcl10, ferritin, ifn-γ, il-6, il-8, 
 and il-15).</p><p>
 association of b-cell levels with pharmacokinetic parameters and disease response.</p><p>
 b-cell levels were calculated as a percentage of viable leukocytes, representing the number of cd19+, cd20+, 
 or cd19+cd20+ b cells relative to total viable cd45+ immune cells in a flow cytometry assay. it should be 
 noted that the flow cytometry assay used did not discriminate between circulating normal and cancerous 
 cd19+cd20+ b cells. at baseline, after conditioning therapy but prior car t-cell infusion, median 
 cd19+/cd20+ b-cell levels were 8.7% of viable cd45+ leukocytes (range: 0.024% to 95.237%). after 
 kte-x19 infusion, the first measurement of b-cells was at month 3, the second by month 18. by month 3, the 
 median b-cell levels declined to 0.1% (range: 0.017% to 96.147%), and by month 18, median b-cell levels 
 demonstrated recovery (median: 10.6%). subjects in ongoing response and subjects whose mcl had relapsed 
 had numerically lower levels of b cells compared with non-responders (10.6% and 7.1% versus 35.7%, 
 respectively). in subjects with ongoing response, b cells seem to have recovered.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 association of product characteristics with kte-x19 pharmacokinetics associations between a number of key product-related characteristics and peak post-infusion levels of 
 anti-cd19 car t cells were explored. these analyses are only exploratory in nature. they included: 
 transduction rate (%), ifn-γ (pg/ml), cd4:cd8 ratio, t cell phenotype, total number of t cells infused (x 10
 6), ccr7
 + (tnaïve</p><p>+ tcm), %, total number of ccr7+ t cells infused (x 106), ccr7-</p><p>(tem + teff), %,</p><p>and vector copy number (copies per cell). 
 ifn-γ in co-culture, and cd4:cd8 ratio showed potential associations (p ≤ 0.05) with post-infusion levels of 
 anti-cd19 car t cells. although a potential association was seen with ifn-γ in co-culture and cd4:cd8 ratio 
 with kte-x19 pharmacokinetics, these associations were not monotonic; ie, no apparent trend existed in a 
 quartile analyses of product characteristic with grade 3 or higher neurologic events, grade 3 or higher crs, or 
 objective response. 
 no association was identified (based on nominal p values &gt; 0.05) between other observed characteristics and

 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>pharmacokinetics and response rate</p><p>for subjects treated with the kte-x19 in cohort 1 at the target dose of 2 x 10
 6 car t cells/kg, robust car t expansion was observed with a median time to peak levels of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood of 15 days after 
 kte-x19 infusion. anti-cd19 car t-cell levels decreased to near background levels by month 3 although still 
 detectable by qpcr at month 24 in 6 of 10 subjects (60%) with evaluable samples.</p><p>
 median exposure level for subjects in cohort 2 was approximately 60% of the median exposure in subjects in 
 cohort 1. the range of individual times to peak for subjects in cohort 2 compared with subjects in cohort 1 
 was slower, the overall expansion less robust, and the relative percentage of subjects with detectable 
 anti-cd19 car t cells at 12 and 15 months was lower. the results suggest that the higher dose in cohort 1 
 leads to greater anti-cd19 car t-cell persistence.</p><p>
 given the known moa of car-t cells, as well as the correlative analyses indicating that anti-cd19 car t-cell 
 peak and auc0-28 were associated with objective response (cr or pr), the rationale for not selecting the 
 lower 0.5 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg as the dose carried forward might be supported. with respect to orr, dor and pfs, however, there were no differences observed between the two dose cohorts, although 
 the limited number of subjects in cohort 2 hampers a meaningful comparison.</p><p>
 zuma-2 pharmacokinetics parameters demonstrated a positive association with disease response as well as 
 toxicity, including higher grades of neurologic events and crs. the median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell level in 
 responders was more than 100-fold higher than the corresponding level in non-responders, 97.52 versus 0.39</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 cells/μl (p = 0.0020), respectively. this is consistent with earlier observations from other cd19 directed car t cell therapies. 
 with regards to pharmacokinetics in specific populations and subgroups of interest the following observation 
 were made. answers on arising concerns have been provided, which are considered acceptable in view of a 
 granted conditional approval and obligations on post-authorisation measurements: 
 - median anti-cd19 car t-cell levels (peak and auc0-28) were markedly higher in subjects younger than 65 years of age in comparison with subjects aged 65 years or older. it is not clear to which 
 degree the observed difference may be influenced by car-t quality attributes, by differences 
 related to in clinical presentation or other unknown factors. considerations on an age-dependent 
 quality of the car t cells are contrasted by the results of the subgroup analyses on orr, which 
 revealed no clear differences between both age cohorts. in order to achieve a better understanding 
 for age specific interactions of pharmacology and clinical outcome additional subgroup analyses are 
 considered to be provided in the studies adopted as specific obligation for the conditional marketing 
 authorisation.</p><p>
 - no differences with regard to race were observed for anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion.</p><p>- higher values of cmax and auc-values for anti-cd19 car t cells were associated with tocilicumab and/or steroids administered for the management of crs or icans, an observation that is not 
 surprising. car t cells are the presumed cause for higher levels of crs and neurologic events 
 subsequently treated with immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p> 
 - while no simple monotonic association with anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion and base line tumour burden was observed, there still seems to be a trend towards less anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion 
 in subjects with the highest baseline tumour burden. median anti-cd19 car t-cell peak values 
 reported were 133 cells/μl for subjects in the third quartile, but dropped down to 48 cells/μl for 
 subjects in the fourth quartile, with corresponding auc0-28, median values being 2168 
 cells/μl•days in the third quartile, vs 566 cells/μl•days in the fourth quartile. while subgroup 
 analysis revealed no difference in orr rates in subject ≥ median base line tumour burden vs subject 
 &lt; median base line tumour burden, it is noted that for the subgroup analysis of ongoing response 
 rates (cohort 1, inferential analysis set), a trend towards lower response rates for subject ≥ median 
 base line tumour burden was observed. data on the ongoing response rates according to tumour 
 burden broken down into quartiles have been provided and clearly show that while subjects with 
 high tumour burden had similar orr as compared to subjects with lower tumour burden, cr rates 
 where lower and fewer subjects experienced durable long-term responses. discussion on the 
 underlying mechanisms for inferior t-cell expansion in subjects with the highest tumour burden, 
 citing relevant literature, has been provided indicating that recent data from subjects with 
 relapsed/refractory large b-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel also demonstrate 
 that subjects with high tumour volume have worse outcomes (dean 2020, locke 2018). the 
 mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully elucidated but may include insufficient car 
 t-cell expansion relative to the tumour burden, owing to possible detrimental impact of the tumour 
 microenvironment in large tumour lesions (rossi 2019). whether limitation with regards to efficacy 
 could be overcome by adjusting car-t dose in subjects with higher tumour burden has not been 
 discussed. 
 - pharmacokinetics analysis by mcl morphologic characteristics showed that subjects with blastoid variant mcl had reduced anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion and overall exposure compared with 
 subjects with classical mcl morphology (2- to 3-fold differences between median values).</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 51/131 
 interestingly, no correlation with lower orr or dor were observed for subjects with blastoid variant mcl. however, subjects with diffuse mcl morphology had even more reduced anti anti-cd19 car 
 t-cell expansion and overall exposure. for these subjects, subgroup analysis indicated a trend 
 towards lower orr and dor. 
 bioanalysis of 17 key serum biomarkers measured prior to and after kte-x19 treatment showed trends 
 consistent with the known mechanism of action of anti-cd19 car t-cell therapy (including lymphodepletion) 
 and associations with neurologic events and crs. homeostatic cytokines crp, ferritin, il-7, and il-15 increased 
 after conditioning chemotherapy treatment, and were elevated at day 0. at peak, the majority of analytes 
 increased by 2-fold or more in ≥ 50% of subjects. most analytes returned to near baseline by week 4. overall, 
 these results were consistent with previously reported results observed with anti-cd19 car t-cell treatment of 
 nhl. exploratory analysis of the same biomarkers in csf found pro-inflammatory cytokines crp, cxcl-10, and 
 il-6 to be elevated at peak by 5-fold or more in comparison with baseline median. 
 in an exploratory analysis conducted to evaluate the association of pre-infusion product characteristics with 
 anti-cd19 car t-cell expansion only 2 pre-infusion product characteristics were shown to have a positive 
 association with post-infusion levels of anti-cd19 car t-cell levels: ifn-γ in co-culture and cd4:cd8 ratio. the 
 association, however, was not monotonic and the relevance of these findings is unknown, since association 
 between these product attributes and clinical outcomes was not observed. moreover, a relevance of biomarkers 
 such as ifn-gamma or il-15 or macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha for prognostic purpose on treatment 
 outcome was not established. 
 analysis of association of b-cell levels with pharmacokinetic parameters and disease response showed that at 
 month 3, median b-cell levels declined to 0.1% (range: 0.017% to 96.147%). subjects in ongoing response who 
 had b-cell aplasia had numerically higher median car t-cell levels than subjects in ongoing response who had 
 detectable b-cells. however, ongoing b-cell depletion was not required for maintaining disease response to 
 month 24, since b cells had recovered by month 24 in subjects in ongoing response. there is still substantial 
 uncertainty with regards to b-cell aplasia as a marker for durable responses in subjects treated with cd19 
 directed car t cells. results for kte-x19 are in line with results obtained with other car t products, for which 
 a number of patients are in long-term remission with b-cell recovery.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.5">2.4.5.  
 conclusions on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data for kte-x19 are based on 1 clinical study and comparison and analyses of results across studies is not applicable. zuma-2 was not designed to test for differences between 
 subgroups and formal comparisons were not pre-specified. the results of the subgroup analyses are descriptive 
 only. the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors has been assessed in an explorative manner. no population 
 analysis has been performed due to the sparse pk data base available.</p><p>
 assessments for clinical pharmacology in the zuma 2 trial were based on the known mechanism of action of 
 anti-cd19 car t cell and the current knowledge of the safety profile of the conditioning chemotherapy and 
 anti-cd19 car t-cell infusion. conventional studies on pharmacokinetics including absorption, distribution, 
 metabolism and excretion of kte-x19 are not applicable. the clinical benefit of kte-x19, i.e. a complete or 
 partial response after treatment with kte-x19 is supported by the results of pharmacology data.</p><p>however, a 
 conclusion on a possible correlation of cell persistence and long-term efficacy outcomes is not possible due to the 
 limited data available. with respect to pharmacodynamics, there is currently no evidence of a positive 
 correlation between certain biomarkers and a positive treatment outcome.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 52/131 
 although extrapolation of data on pharmacology of kte-c19 to kte-x19 is somehow acceptable, there are remaining uncertainties concerning differences in gender and age in the zuma-2 population particularly due to 
 the lack of results on population pk and pd. given the general low number of treated patients in the zuma-2 
 trial, the unequal distribution gender and the very rough age classification (&lt;65 years old and ≥65 years old), 
 the following incomprehensibilities require detailed analyses:</p><p>
 -</p><p>medium peak of anti-cd19 car t cell value: 112.45 cells/γl (&lt;65 years old) and 74.08 cells/γl (≥65 
 years old</p><p>
 -</p><p>median anti-cd19 car t-cell auc0-28 value: 876.48 cells/μl•days in subjects ≥ 65 years of age and 
 1640.21 cells/μl•days in subjects &lt; 65 years of age</p><p>
 this is particularly noteworthy since both median peak of anti-cd19 car t levels and auc
 0-28 were associated with better results on objective response. 
 the issue was partially addressed by the applicant and it will be further followed post marketing in the studies

 the following criteria were required for a study’s inclusion in the meta-analysis:</p><p>
 • subjects must have had r/r mcl. • subjects’ disease must have progressed while receiving, or relapsed after, a btk inhibitor. • subjects must have received salvage therapy after disease progression or relapse following the btk inhibitor. 
 • response outcomes must have been included in the publication. through the literature search, 255 subjects across 6 published studies were identified for inclusion in the 
 meta-analysis. in addition to the 2 studies (n = 92) originally used to determine the historical control rate in 
 zuma-2, 4 studies were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. all 6 of these studies

 the pooled orr from the meta-analysis of 6 studies was 28% (95% ci: 23%, 34%), which is clinically 
 consistent with the historical control orr of 25%. in addition, response rates published in these studies were 
 based on investigator assessment, and the majority were single-institution studies. considering that 1) 
 response rates determined by central assessment are often lower than those determined by investigator review 
 (zhang 2017), and 2) the primary efficacy endpoint of zuma-2 is the orr per central assessment, the results of 
 the meta-analysis support the pre-specified 25% historical control orr in zuma-2.</p><p>
 primarily, the use of the historical control rate for orr was based on two retrospective studies (cheah 2015 and 
 martin 2016). in these two studies, outcomes after salvage therapy were evaluated in patients with r/r mcl who 
 had progressed during or following treatment with a btk inhibitor (a required prior therapy for zuma-2 
 eligibility). both studies demonstrated that patients with r/r mcl who had ≥ 3 prior lines before receiving the 
 btk inhibitor had orrs to salvage therapy of approximately 25%.</p><p>
 in february 2019, an updated literature search was undertaken to further understand the outcomes of patients 
 with r/r mcl whose disease had progressed during or following treatment with a btk inhibitor. studies identified 
 through this search were to be included in a meta-analysis of orrs to salvage therapy after discontinuing 
 treatment with a btk inhibitor. the meta-analysis was to be used to calculate a pooled orr reflective of clinical 
 outcomes with therapies that are currently available and to support the preselected control orr of 25%. the 
 following criteria were required for a study’s inclusion in the meta-analysis: 
  subjects must have had r/r mcl. 
  subjects must have progressed while receiving, or relapsed after receiving, a btk inhibitor. 
  subjects must have received salvage therapy after progression or relapse following the btk inhibitor. 
  response outcomes must have been included in the publication. 
 through this literature search, 255 subjects across 6 published studies were identified for inclusion in the 
 meta-analysis. in addition to the 2 studies originally used to determine the historical control rate in zuma-2, 4 
 studies were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis (dreyling 2016, epperla 2017, jain 
 2018a, wang 2017). all 6 of these studies described outcomes for patients who had discontinued ibrutinib. two 
 additional studies that were identified from the literature search of outcomes following btk inhibitor treatment, 
 were not included in the meta-analysis: 1 due to the preliminary single institution report of the results (jain 
 2018b) and the subsequent inclusion of some of the same subjects in zuma-2, and 1 study of venetoclax, which 
 is not approved for the treatment of r/r mcl in the us or europe and was administered off-label via a 
 compassionate use programme (eyre 2019).</p><p>
 after the meta-analysis was conducted in february 2019, 2 additional studies of outcomes following btk 
 inhibitor treatment were identified (both conference presentations) (mcculloch 2019, regny 2019). however, 
 the meta-analysis was not updated because the studies included preliminary data that had not yet been peer 
 reviewed. 
 the applicant provided satisfactory responses on the concerns with regard to the representativeness of the 
 historical control data. based on them, it appears the historical controls may have been somewhat less 
 “fit”</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 86/131 
 than the study population (i.e. there were more patients with ecog ≥2, fewer patients with prior stc, and (for the 293 patients where data were available) only approximately half of patients received combination salvage 
 therapies). furthermore, for several studies the baseline data (including the data on number of prior therapies) 
 seem to be recorded at the start of btki treatment, thus indicating that the historical cohort were more heavily 
 pre-treated at the time of post-btki salvage therapy. 
 therefore, there is heterogeneity amongst the several trials serving as historical control and</p><p> the 
 representativeness of the historical data for the study population cannot be verified. this remaining uncertainty 
 supports the decision of a conditional approval and the necessity to amend the clinical data in order to be 
 comprehensive.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.3">2.5.3.

 and more severe patients). this will be further addressed by the specific obligations imposed in the frame of the 
 conditional marketing authorisation.</p><p> 
 the pivotal data comes from one single, uncontrolled open-label ongoing, phase 2 study, kte-c19-102 
 (zuma-2), and is based on a two data cut-off points, 24th july 2019 and 31 december 2019.</p><p>
 dose: no formal dose-finding studies were conducted. the proposed dose (cohort 1: 2 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg), was informed by results obtained with yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) administered to subjects 
 with refractory aggressive large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) in the zuma-1 trial, and further substantiated by pk 
 cell expansion data. the data on the lower dose are too limited to draw any conclusion therefore, considering the 
 shown efficacy and the balanced and manageable safety, the dose used in the pivotal study cohort 1 is 
 considered acceptable. 
 pivotal study design: the zuma-2 study is an uncontrolled, open label, multicentre, phase 2 study evaluating 
 the safety and efficacy of kte-x19 in two dose cohorts of subjects with r/r mcl. the uncontrolled study design, 
 has been considered acceptable in prior scientific advice. the pivotal cohort (cohort 1) was to enrol and treat up 
 to 80 subjects with kte-x19 at a target dose of 2 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. an additional ten subjects enrolled in cohort 1 received yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel). seventeen subjects were enrolled in cohort 2 
 and received 0.5 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. only patients enrolled to receive kte-x19 in cohort 1 contributed to the primary efficacy analyses.</p><p>
 the applicant defined the first 60 subjects treated with kte-x19 (inferential analysis set) as the primary efficacy 
 population that would form the basis for statistical hypothesis testing. this was not endorsed by the chmp 
 (emea/h/sa/3117/7/2019/pa/adt/pr/iii), as it contradicts the itt principle and makes the primary analysis 
 population not clearly representative of any definable external population. the assessment therefore focused on 
 data for the full analysis set and the required presentation of the data for the fas has been provided, indicating 
 that there were no noticeable differences.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 87/131 
 subjects were considered enrolled at the time of leukapheresis. bridging therapy was allowed at the discretion of the investigator and included single agent drugs from the same classes as those used in the previous 
 treatment lines (dexamethasone or a btki). the chmp expressed concern over the potential carry over effect 
 from bridging therapy (emea/h/sa/3117/7/2019/pa/adt/pr/iii). in accordance to the clinical trial protocol, 
 subjects receiving bridging therapy were to have a repeat diagnostic pet-ct scan prior to conditioning 
 chemotherapy.</p><p>
 the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen was identical to that used for yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in 
 large b-cell lymphoma, and could be repeated if the kte-x19 infusion was delayed by &gt; 2 weeks. this is 
 considered acceptable.</p><p>
 subjects who achieved a pr or cr had the option to receive a second course of conditioning chemotherapy and 
 kte-x19 if experiencing cd-19 positive disease progression &gt; 3 months after the initial infusion.</p><p>two subjects 
 were retreated with kte-x19, where 1 subject achieved a best overall response of cr and the other subject had 
 a best overall response of pd, respectively.</p><p>
 patient population: the study included patients with pathologically confirmed r/r mcl (documented by either 
 overexpression of cyclin d1 or presence of t(11;14)). patients were to have received up to 5 prior regimens for 
 mcl, including an anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody 
 as well as a btki. the initial discrepancy between the study population which did not specify a lower limit to prior 
 therapies and the proposed indication (r/r mcl, i.e. from 2nd line) was corrected by the applicant.</p><p>
 further key eligibility criteria included ps 0-1, no toxicities from previous therapies and adequate renal, hepatic, 
 pulmonary, and cardiac function. patients with a history of allo-sct were excluded, as were patients with a 
 history of hbv and hiv infection. these criteria define a rather selected patient population, with implications for 
 the external validity of the trial and the comparisons to external data on which the orr cut-off has been 
 established.</p><p>
 endpoints: the primary endpoint, orr by irrc, is acceptable in the context of an uncontrolled trial. responses 
 were assessed according to the lugano classification, which is endorsed. however, the requirement for bone 
 marrow confirmation of cr in patients with baseline bone marrow involvement was only introduced in protocol 
 amendment 5 (i.e. after inclusion of the first 28 patients in cohort 1). however the majority of patients with 
 baseline bone marrow involvement has been evaluated with a bone-marrow confirmed cr.</p><p>
 the secondary endpoints include endpoints conventional for oncology trials such as dor, pfs and os and are 
 considered acceptable. 
 orr control rate: the historical control rate for orr (25%) was pre-specified based on 2 retrospective published 
 studies evaluating post-btki salvage therapy outcomes in patients with r/r mcl. subsequently, a meta-analysis 
 of 6 studies (including the original 2 studies) was undertaken (february 2019), to further inform the historical 
 response rates. the pooled orr from this meta-analysis was 28% (95% ci: 23%, 34%). concerns were 
 expressed by the chmp (emea/h/sa/3117/7/2019/pa/adt/pr/iii) that the orr cut-off was not an a priori 
 decision and that an orr above 25% would not be considered sufficiently compelling in the context of a single 
 pivotal, single arm trial. these issues, however, are considered overcome by the high response rates reported 
 for kte-x19 (orr 85%, 95% ci 75.0%, 92.3%), indicating significant results would be achieved also with a 
 substantially higher orr success criterion. 
 nevertheless, there are several uncertainties related to the way the historical control rate was defined and its 
 representativeness for the study population. specifically, it remains unclear how heterogeneity between studies 
 in the meta-analysis affected the estimation of the pooled orr. furthermore, limited details were provided</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 88/131 
 concerning the search protocol and the publications excluded from the meta-analysis. in conclusion the study population may include a larger proportion of patients which would have been eligible for allo-sct in a standard 
 of care setting, for which the outcomes of the historical cohort may not be representative.</p><p>
 statistical methods, interim analysis and study conduct: the statistical design, sample sizes, sensitivity 
 analyses and alpha correction for the pre-specified interim analyses are considered acceptable. four interim 
 analyses to be reviewed by dsmb were conducted (3 in cohort 1 and 1 in cohort 2). an additional interim 
 analysis (cohort 1 interim analysis 3) was performed for a kite internal review. the implication of this analysis 
 for the trial integrity requires further clarification. furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the description 
 of the interim analyses and data monitoring in the study protocol and the series of events as described in crs. 
 whereas the study protocol describes a cohort 1, interim 2 analysis to be conducted after 20 subjects had the 
 opportunity to be followed for 3 months post infusion, the crs reports that the opening of dosing cohort 2 was 
 based on an interim analysis of 28 subjects, followed for 3 months after the car t-cell infusion. in addition, a 
 late protocol amendment (amendment 5) describes the “identification” of two interim analyses (cohort 1, 
 analysis 2 and 3) and the addition of one interim analysis (cohort 1, analysis 4). thus, there is uncertainty 
 concerning the number of interim analyses conducted and the degree to which these analyses were 
 pre-specified, including the time-point at which they were introduced into the study protocol.</p><p>
 the original protocol, dated 12 march 2015, was amended 6 times, with subjects receiving kte-x19 in cohort 1 
 enrolling from amendment 3 and onwards. several key design elements were introduced in protocol 
 amendment 5, including the definition of the primary efficacy population and the statistical testing strategy for 
 the primary endpoint. the applicant is requested to clarify the conduct of the study both with respect to the 
 timing of the interim analyses, and the protocol amendments (section 3.3), and to justify that these interim 
 analyses and protocol amendments did not compromise the integrity of the study.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the provided results are based on one main clinical trial, zuma 2, an ongoing, uncontrolled open-label, multicentre trial with two treatment cohorts (cohort 1: 2.0x10exp6 cells/kg; cohort 2: 0.5x10exp6 cells/kg) 
 with a primary data cut-off 24 july 2019. additional efficacy results for a secondary data cut-off 31 december 
 2019 have been provided on request. the study was conducted in 40 clinical centres in usa, netherlands, 
 france and germany. dose selection for cohort 1 is based upon pharmacology results due to an interim analysis 
 in zuma-2 indicating the dose of 2.0x10exp6 cells/kg to be safe and effective, and on results of the zuma-1 trial 
 where the administered car t-cell product was axicabtagene ciloleucel. cohort 1 of zuma 2 is regarded the 
 pivotal data set. of the 74 patients that were included in the trial 68 subjects received treatment with kte-x19 
 at the target dose of 2x10exp6 cells/kg. in cohort 2, which is descriptive only, 14 subjects received treatment 
 with kte-x19 at the target dose of 0.5x10exp6 cells/kg. 
 the primary efficacy endpoint of orr (cr and pr) assessed by central assessment as well as the key secondary 
 endpoints of dor and pfs have been accepted in prior scientific advice. the study population has been analyzed 
 by fas (n=74), ias (n=60), mitt (n=68) including subgroup sets. 
 as requested, the applicant provided an update on efficacy data, presented for fas only for cut-off date 24 july 
 2019 and 31 december 2019.</p><p> 
 cut-off-24 july 2019: 
 the fas is not significantly different in terms of durability of responses observed in patients achieving a best 
 orr of cr, pr. the fas confirms the previous assessment of pfs or os, and is consistent with the results from</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 89/131 
 the ias. the subgroup analyses for orr, dor and ongoing response are overall consistent with the results based on the inferential analyses set. orrs ranging from 50% to 100% are reported in the fas across the 
 subgroups analysed, where orrs ranged from 75% to 100% in the inferential analysis set. in all subgroups with 
 &gt;5 subjects the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals were above the pre-specified historic control orr of 
 25% and also above the upper ci reported for the meta-analysis (34%). 
 cut-off 31 december 2019: 
 the results are consistent with the analyses based on the 24 july 2019 cut-off, with orrs from 50% to 100% 
 across the subgroups analysed. in all subgroups with &gt;5 subjects the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals 
 were above the pre-specified historic control orr of 25% and also above the upper ci reported for the 
 meta-analysis (34%).the median dor was not reached (95% ci:10.4 months, ne) with a median follow-up 
 time for dor of 13.8 months (95% ci: 11.3, 20.5 months), and no subgroup analysis of dor is therefore 
 presented. 
 in subgroups with 
 ≥ 5 subjects, the ongoing response rates at data cutoff ranged from 17% to 70% and were generally consistent with the analysis at the 24 july 2019 cut-off. a durable response is observed in patients 
 achieving a best orr of cr (median dor (95% ci: 14.4, ne). for the 18 subjects who achieved a pr, the 
 median dor remains short (2.2 months, 95% ci: 1.4, 4.9 months). estimates of the ongoing response rate at 
 6 months and 12 months were each 25.9%. sensitivity analyses remains consistent between the analysis sets. in the updated analysis set, median pfs was still not reached in patients achieving a best orr of cr, with pfs 
 rate estimates at 6 and 12 months of 100% and 80.2%, respectively. median pfs among subjects who achieved 
 a pr was 5.4 months (95% ci: 3.3, 6.7 months),</p><p>with pfs rate estimates of at 6 months and 12 months of 
 46.3% and 26.5%, respectively. consistency across most subgroups was observed, although lower point 
 estimates were reported in some subgroups with small patient numbers. cis were wide and overlapping. 
 the quality of life data has been collected with the eq-5d questionnaire throughout the trial. while very 
 welcome on a principle level, interpretation is hampered by lack of control and an open label design.</p><p>

 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>the definition of patients to be treated with kte-x19, is now addressed satisfactorily as the applicant updated the indication, which now reflects adequately the patient population in the clinical trial. 
 the unmet medical need for effective treatments for patients suffering from r/r mcl after failure of btk 
 inhibitors is acknowledged. the results on primary and secondary endpoints in the zuma-2 trial indicate efficacy 
 of kte-x19 for the treatment of r/r mcl in the target population.</p><p> 
 the provided update on efficacy-analyses with the cut-off date of 31 december 2019 indicates consistency of 
 results on subgroup analysis for orr and dor compared with results of the cut-off date 24 july 2019. moreover, 
 the results in the fas with regard to orr, cr, pfs and os confirm the efficacy of kte-x19 as evaluated on basis 
 of the results in the ias.</p><p>
 the remaining uncertainties result from the limited dataset in the zuma-2 pivotal cohort 1. the applicant agreed 
 to amend the data post-marketing by a registry for the evaluation of efficacy of kte-x19 in terms of objective 
 response rate as primary objective including the required population (female, elderly and more severe patients) 
 and to include further specific assessments for efficacy as secondary objectives. moreover, the safety of 
 kte-x19 will be assessed as secondary objective in this post-approval study. 
 as regards the required long-term follow up of patients in the pivotal cohort of the zuma-2 trial, the applicant is 
 required to provide long-term results for efficacy and safety for those patients and to submit the anticipated 
 study report in 2022 to the ema. 
 therefore, the cat considers the following measures necessary to 
 ensure the follow-up of 
 efficacy:</p><p>
 • a long term follow up: in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in 
 adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) the mah shall conduct and 
 submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol.</p><p>
 the cat furthermore considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
 context of a conditional ma
 : 
 • in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl and the benefit/risk balance in the female, elderly and severely diseased patients, 
 the mah shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating efficacy and safety based on 
 data from the same registry used to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus, 
 according to an agreed protocol.</p><p> 
 • in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl the mah shall submit the 24 months follow-up data from all treated patients in

 failure and grade 4 acute respiratory distress syndrome; both grade 4 events started on day 21 and were 
 ongoing as of the date of death. preceding events included grade 3 increased blood creatinine (day 32 to day 
 34) followed by grade 3 decreased urine output (starting on day 34 and ongoing as of the date of death). the

 day 16 to day 20, respectively) as well as an sae of confusional state, maximum grade 3 (starting on day 10

 unrelated to kte-x19. 
  a patient in cohort 1 died due to staphylococcal bacteraemia (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) on 
 day 134 after the kte-x19 infusion; the fatal event was listed as streptococcal bacteraemia as of the data cutoff 
 date. per the subject’s request, he was discharged on day 132 and discontinued treatments. on day 134, he 
 died due to sepsis (staphylococcal bacteraemia). no autopsy was performed. per the investigator, treatment 
 with high-dose steroids likely contributed to susceptibility to the infection. the death was deemed related to

 metabolic acidosis that was linked to the cardiac arrest. the metabolic acidosis and elevated anion gap worsened 
 on day 6, followed by crs on day 10 (which resolved on day 13) and encephalopathy on day 12 (which was

 there is no relevant clinical experience with kte-x19 therapy in pregnant women, and animal reproductive studies have not been performed. once infused, car t-cells may persist long term and women who plan a 
 pregnancy should consult their physician. this therapy should not be administered to pregnant women. women 
 of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrolment due to the potentially 
 dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the foetus. contraception must be used during treatment 
 and for 6 months after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy and kte-x19. this is reflected in smpc section 
 4.6.

 in the zuma-2 study in cohort 1 68 subjects received the intended target dose of 2.0 x 106 anti-cd19 car t 
 cells/kg, whereas for cohort 2 14 subjects received 0.5 x 106 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. there are no significant 
 dose dependent differences with respect to aes in the two cohorts. the median potential follow-up time from the 
 kte-x19 infusion for all subjects dosed in cohort 1 was 16.8 months (range: 7.2 to 37.6 months). the median</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 109/131 
 potential follow-up time from the kte-x19 infusion for subjects in cohort 2 was 16.0 months (range: 13.9 to 18.0 months). the median potential follow-up time from the kte-x19 infusion for subjects in cohort 2 was 21.3 
 months (range: 19.1 to 23.2 months).</p><p>in the three supportive studies a total of 143 patients were treated with 
 kte-x19 at various doses (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 x 106 car t cells/kg). only 13 patients in the supportive studies 
 received the intended dose of 2.0 x 106 car t cells/kg.</p><p>
 all patients in zuma-2 had at least one ae, 80 subjects (98%) had worst grade 3 or higher aes, and 56 subjects 
 (68%) had serious aes (saes). the most common kte-x19 related aes reported were pyrexia, hypotension, 
 chills, tremor, anaemia, hypoxia, white blood cell count decrease, encephalopathy and tachycardia. many of 
 these are symptoms of the most critical aes, in particular crs, neurologic aes, cytopenias and infections. time 
 to onset was usually a few days and duration was in median 11-12 days, but could last for several months, in 
 particular for neurologic aes. all crs and most neurologic aes were reversible with adequate management 
 according to recommended guidelines (smpc section 4.4), but four subjects had still ongoing neurologic aes at 
 cut-off date. one death (caused by staphylococcus bacteraemia) was considered related to conditional 
 chemotherapy and kte-x19 infusion.</p><p>
 mcl is primarily a cancer disease in elderly above 65 years of age and in the pivotal study (zuma-2) in total 42 
 (51% of subjects) were 
 ≥65 years, in cohort 1, 39 (57%) subjects were ≥65 years. there are only minor differences in the two age groups regarding aes. the older patients seem to have a slightly higher incidence of 
 aes. sex could have a more significant influence on the number and severity of aes, as women seem more prone 
 to develop aes and these aes are of higher grade, when compared to male study participants. this divergence 
 has been also observed for yescarta and seems to be irrespective of the indication.</p><p>
 pregnant women are not allowed to undergo the therapy, and contraception must be used for 6 months after 
 receiving the therapy. breastfeeding women were also prohibited in receiving this therapy.</p><p>
 the safety of kte-x19 has not been investigated separately for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 there were no paediatric patients treated with mcl 
 for the patients included in the pivotal study, the vast majority had crs of any grade as well as neurologic 
 events, and the majority of the patients also had different grades of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or anaemia. 
 about half of the patients suffered from an infection episode, and about 16% of the patients had 
 hypogammaglobulinemia.</p><p> 
 the important identified risks and the potential risks identified for kte-x19 are similar to the aes identified for 
 this product class. the important identified risks are: crs, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, 
 hypogammaglobulinemia.</p><p>
 crs and neurologic events had an early onset. neurologic aes were often seen as part of the crs events. all 
 crs events were resolved at the time of the data cutoff. neurologic events resolved for all but 6 subjects; 2 of 
 the 6 subjects had ongoing neurologic events at the time of death: 1 subject had ongoing neurologic event not 
 related to kte-x19, the other subject had 2 ongoing neurologic events related to kte-x19 (agitation and 
 confusional state). the remaining unresolved neurologic events in 4 subjects were either grade 1 (tremor and 
 dysaesthesia) or grade 2 (hypoaesthesia). data indicates that there can be an association between both tumour 
 burden/disease burden and dose infused (number of car-t cells/kg) and the risk for crs and neurologic aes. 
 the higher peak blood levels of kte-x19 correlated well with higher grades of crs and cres. the applicant was 
 requested to discuss such data from zuma-studies and possible associations with the severity, duration and 
 management of crs and neurologic aes for both cohorts. no clear linear relationship between tumour burden</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 110/131 
 and the incidence of severe crs or neurologic events, or relationship between dose of car-t cells given and incidence of such events was found in the data. 
 management plans for crs and neurotoxicity are included in the smpc in conjunction with the respective 
 grading guidance. patients with crs or neurotoxicity were treated with steroids, tocilizumab, supplemental 
 oxygen and vasopressors: 71% were treated with tocilizumab for any ae, 38% were treated with steroids for 
 neurologic aes, 56% were treated with both steroids and tocilizumab. 28% of subjects had to be treated with 
 more than two doses of tocilizumab.</p><p>
 cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinaemias lead to the increased risk of infections. these aes were managed 
 according to standard protocols and this is also indicated in the smpc. cytopenias usually resolved within a few 
 weeks, but in some cases were present at 30 days after infusion. a challenge when assessing the degree of 
 cytopenias related to kte-x19 is the fact that cytopenias also are frequent aes following medicines used in the 
 bridging therapy and conditional chemotherapy given the period before kte-x19 infusion.</p><p>however, inclusion 
 criteria were “toxicities due to prior therapy must have been stable and recovered to 
 ≤ grade 1”, which should imply that the worsening of cytopenias observed after kte-x19 infusion are probably related to lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy or the car-t infusion. duration of cytopenias is reported as “presence on and after day 30”. 
 twenty-two subjects (32%) were administered gammaglobulines in the pivotal study, cohort 1.</p><p>
 cardiac aes were reported following kte-x19 infusion. there was a trend in lower frequencies of cardiac 
 arrhythmias (57% and 79%) and cardiac failure (4% and 7%) in cohort 1 compared to cohort 2. cardiac 
 arrhythmias are reported as part of crs. these cardiac aes are not considered as direct cardiotoxicity from 
 anti-cd19 car t cells. the cardiac elevations seem rather to be associated with crs or concomitant tls 
 there was one case of tumour lysis syndrome in cohort 1, which resolved upon treatment with rasburicase. in 
 total 16% of subjects in cohort 1 had increase in urate of grade 
 ≥3. this may be associated with the risk of tls. in smpc section 4.4 there is a recommendation to administer allopurinol in patients with elevated uric acid and 
 high tumour burden prior to infusion. 
 there were three subjects who died in the pivotal study due to aes. one case was deemed related to 
 conditioning chemotherapy but unrelated to kte-x19, one case was deemed related to conditioning 
 chemotherapy and kte-x19. the third patient deceased as a consequence of a pre-existing condition, which was 
 not deemed related to the study treatment. in the supportive studies a total of 11 subjects deceased due to aes. 
 from these cases two were deemed to be kte-x19 related, a further patient deceased due to a grade 5 cerebral 
 oedema after the cut-off date.</p><p>
 interestingly, there are several patients with negative cd19 ihc (6 patients) and with cd19 ihc results 
 unavailable (19 patients). nonetheless, acknowledging the limited number of these patients, based on the data 
 provided by the applicant no obvious safety risk could be identified for cd19 negative subjects. 
 within the observed aes some can be directly linked to the conditioning chemotherapy (cytopenias), and other 
 aes are directly linked to the administration of kte-x19. crs and neurological adverse reaction are likely caused 
 by kte-x19, while cytopenias might also be related to conditioning chemotherapy or previous therapies even 
 though most laboratory values should be of grade 
 ≤1 before kte-x19 infusion. the aes described here are in line with the aes of car t cell products and are a direct consequence of the mode of action of these products. these 
 aes are expected to occur based on the previous experience with this product class. though the safety data is 
 limited for any firm conclusion, the safety profile of kte-x19 appears to be in accordance with the expected 
 known class effects.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 no further risks and aes could be identified which would be specific for kte-x19 or for the indication to be treated with kte-x19. the important identified risks in the rmp are: crs, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, 
 hypogammaglobulinemia. there are some potential risks linked to the use of this product: secondary 
 malignancy, immunogenicity, rcr, tumour lysis syndrome, and aggravation of gvhd. these risks will be 
 followed part of the pharmacovigilance activities described in the rmp. 
 essentially, these aes and risks are similar to what has been described for other car t cell therapies. no further 
 risks and aes could be identified which would be specific for kte-x19 or for the indication to be treated with 
 kte-x19. the risk mitigation measures are presented in the smpc and are in line with the general management 
 plans for this product class.

 safety: 
 • a long term follow up: in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) the mah shall conduct and 
 submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol.

 furthermore considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
 context of a conditional ma: 
 • in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl and the benefit/risk balance in the female, elderly and severely diseased patients, 
 the mah shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating efficacy and safety based on

 based on art. 63(3), the applicant requested the use of minimum particulars on the label to be included on the

 the company claimed there was insufficient space for full particulars. they proposed to display the name of the

 patient name, patient dob), volume, information on autologous use and need to verify patient identity. the use 
 of minimum particulars would also allow for the batch specific information to be clearly inserted by hand.

 disease or condition</header><p>mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is an aggressive subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) with distinctive clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics and a generally aggressive, albeit heterogeneous, clinical course. the 
 lymphoma cells in mcl are thought to originate from antigen-naive pre-germinal centre b cells within the mantle 
 zone of the lymph node and typically express several surface markers including cd19 and cd20. the molecular 
 hallmark of mcl is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which results in overexpression of the cell 
 cycle regulator cyclin d1.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 120/131 
 mcl patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease (stage iii or iv), characterised by an aggressive clinical course. patients present with generalised lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement of the blood, 
 bone marrow, spleen and gastrointestinal (15% to 30%). prognostic factors include the (simplified) mipi risk 
 score (performance status, age, ldh levels &gt; upper limit of normal, and white blood cell count), which can be 
 further improved by adding the ki
 ‐67 proliferative index. morphological variant also impacts outcome, with blastoid and pleomorphic cytomorphology being associated with a poorer prognosis. 
 mcl accounts for approximately 5% to 7% of malignant lymphoma in western europe. the estimated annual 
 incidence of mcl is approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 in europe. mcl is more likely to affect men than women, 
 and the median age at diagnosis is 68 years</p></section><section><header n="3.1.2">3.1.2.  
 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>in the r/r situation in mcl, the treatment concepts comprise immunochemotherapy followed by autologous/allogeneic sct, btk inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib; both approved in the us; only ibrutinib is 
 approved in the eu), the immunomodulatory (and thalidomide analogue) agent lenalidomide, the m-tor 
 inhibitor temsirolimus and the bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax. bortezomib is approved in the eu for use in 
 combination with r-chop for the treatment of newly diagnosed mcl, and it has also been investigated as a 
 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory mcl. an optimal sequence of treatments for r/r mcl has not been 
 established. choice of regimen is influenced by response duration to frontline therapy, comorbidities, tumour 
 chemo-sensitivity, and overall risk-benefit evaluations. 
 responses to asct in relapse are inferior to those in first-line and there is no consensus on the benefit of its use 
 in relapsed/refractory disease (ketterer et al, 1997; robinson et al, 2015). by contrast, allo-sct has the 
 potential to be curative in relapse/refractory mcl (vose 2015), in younger patients (i.e. &lt;65 years) while few 
 patients with r/r mcl are candidates for allo-sct . however, high treatment-related mortality rates of up to 40% 
 following allo-sct were also reported, primarily due to graft-versus host disease, and the majority of patients 
 still did not achieve durable remissions. 
 maintenance regimens with rituximab in the r/r situation have a favourable safety profile and prolong pfs and 
 os, however, second-line maintenance in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance is not recommended 
 which implies a restriction of a therapeutically approach in the r/r situation of mcl a priori.</p><p>
 despite promising high rates of orr (68%) for btk inhibitors (ibrutinib smpc) in the relapsed setting, they are 
 not considered as curative treatments since all patients will eventually have progressive disease after receiving 
 a btk inhibitor.</p><p>
 although the clinical outcome at mcl generally improved in the last years, the r/r situation and disease progress 
 during or after treatment with btk inhibitors mean rather limited further treatment options for the patient. thus, 
 novel therapy strategies resulting in durable response rates are required.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.  
 main clinical studies</header><p>the single pivotal trial is zuma 2, an ongoing phase 2 open label multicentre clinical trial (with data cut-off point of 24th july 2019) to evaluate efficacy and safety of kte-x19 at a target dose of 2x106 cells/kg in the pivotal 
 cohort 1. the study population were adults with r/r mcl after 
 ≤ 5 lines of prior therapy including anthracycline or bendamustine, anti-cd20 mabs and btk inhibitors.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 121/131 
 inclusion criteria were confirmed r/r mcl (documented by either overexpression of cyclin d1 or presence of t(11;14)). patients were to have received up to 5 prior regimens for mcl, including an anthracycline or 
 bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody as well as a btki. patients with a 
 central nervous system lymphoma and a history of allogeneic sct, prior anti-cd 19-targeted therapy, car or 
 other genetically modified t-cell therapy were excluded. 
 subjects were considered enrolled at the time of leukapheresis. bridging therapy with dexamethasone or a btki 
 was allowed at the discretion of the investigator and subjects receiving bridging therapy were to have a repeat 
 diagnostic pet-ct scan prior to conditioning chemotherapy. 
 the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and cyclophosphamide 
 (500 mg/m2/day) administered for three days and could be repeated if the kte-x19 infusion was delayed by &gt; 
 2 weeks. 
 the primary and secondary endpoints in zuma 2 were orr (cr and pr), dor and pfs. the applicant defined the 
 first 60 subjects treated with kte-x19 (inferential analysis set) as the primary efficacy population. however, the 
 cohort 1 full analysis set fas (n=74) was used as the primary basis for the efficacy assessment by central 
 assessment and investigator assessment, respectively.</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.  
 favourable effects</header><p>per data cut-off date 24 july 2019, observed favourable effects for fas were the orr rate of 85 % (95% ci: 75.0%, 92.3%), while cr was 59% (95% ci: 47.4%, 70.7%). the response rates were generally consistent 
 across various evaluable subgroups, with the point estimate for orr ranging from 75% to 100% in individual 
 subgroups, compared to 93% (ci: 84%-98%) which was observed for all subjects (inferential analysis set). 
 regarding efficacy per data cut off 31 december 2019, the figures on orr and cr are considered comparable to 
 the results per data cut-off 24 july 2019 for the fas. the rates for the primary efficacy endpoint of orr per 
 central assessment (85%) and for the secondary efficacy endpoint of dor per central assessment (43% in 
 ongoing response, dor 13.8 months and median dor not reached) are confirmed.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>the population for efficacy evaluation is limited to 74 patients with ecog performance status o and 1 at baseline. it is likely that the recruited population is a selected population. only 14 women were recruited to this 
 trial, even though the point estimate for orr is comparable the ci indicate that efficacy is less well 
 characterised. patients with bulky disease also had considerably lower rate of response, again the patient 
 number is very low. these observations indicate this dataset is very limited and there are uncertainties as 
 regards the external validity of the trial.</p><p>
 while the response to treatment is indicative of activity of a medicinal product, time-related endpoints which are 
 regarded as a standard prerequisite for assessment of patient benefit are lacking for kte-x19. the combination 
 of a high rate of complete responders with durable responses may alleviate this concern, however in the present 
 case long term efficacy data are not available yet and median dor fu is 8.6 months. moreover, the single arm 
 open label design is leading to potentially biased estimates for efficacy.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 the uncertainties and limitation reported above will be captured by the commitments imposed in the frame of the long term follow up study (see annex ii and rmp). in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and 
 safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) the mah shall

 unfavourable effects</header><p>the unfavourable effects for patients treated with kte-x19 do not only occur as a consequence of kte-x19 treatment, but the bridging therapy and conditioning chemotherapy may also induce such effects.</p><p>
 the most common kte-x19 related aes reported in the phase ii study, zuma-2, were pyrexia, hypotension, 
 chills, tremor, anaemia, hypoxia, white blood cell count decrease, encephalopathy and tachycardia.</p><p>many of 
 these are symptoms of the most critical aes, in particular cytokine release syndrome (crs), neurologic aes, 
 cytopenias and infections. time to onset was usually a few days and duration was in median 11-12 days, but 
 could last for several months, in particular for neurologic aes. a list of unfavourable effects are expected and 
 regarded as class effects for car-t cell-based therapies.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome (crs) observed in clinical study subjects treated with kte-x19 has generally been 
 manageable and reversible with supportive care measures, tocilizumab, and/or corticosteroids. in zuma-2 
 cohort 1, 62 subjects (91%) had crs. fifty-two subjects (76%) had worst grade 1 or worst grade 2 crs, 8 
 subjects (12%) had worst grade 3 crs, and 2 subjects (3%) had worst grade 4 crs. no subject had grade 5 
 crs. the median time to onset of crs was 2 days after the kte-x19 infusion. as of the data cutoff date, crs had 
 resolved in all subjects; the median duration of crs was 11 days. crs can be managed with standard supportive 
 care (see smpc). 
 serious neurologic events (cart-related encephalopathy syndrome (cres)) including cerebral oedema 
 observed in clinical study subjects treated with kte-x19 have generally been manageable and reversible with 
 supportive care measures, corticosteroids, and, in the setting of crs, with tocilizumab. in zuma-2 cohort 1, 43 
 subjects (63%) had neurologic events. twenty-two subjects (32%) had worst grade 1 or worst grade 2 
 neurologic events, 15 subjects (22%) had worst grade 3 neurologic events, and 6 subjects (9%) had worst 
 grade 4 neurologic events. no subject had a grade 5 neurologic event. the median time to onset of a neurologic 
 event was 7 days. neurologic events had resolved in 37 of 43 subjects (86%) as of the data cutoff date, and the 
 median duration of neurologic events for those 37 subjects was 12 days. neurologic aes can be managed with 
 standard supportive care and as provided in the adult neurologic toxicity grading and management guidance 
 included in the summary of product characteristics (smpc). 
 infections are often seen in subjects treated with kte-x19. the risk of infection may be increased by 
 neutropenia due to preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy, pre-existing or treatment induced 
 hypogammaglobulinemia, prior cancer treatments, and underlying b-cell malignancy in subjects who receive 
 kte-x19 therapy. in zuma-2 cohort 1, under the soc of infections and infestations, 38 subjects (56%) had aes 
 of any grade. of those subjects with aes of infection, 17 subjects (25%) had worst grade 3, 4 subjects (6%) had 
 worst grade 4, and 1 subject had a grade 5 ae (staphylococcal bacteraemia). compared with subjects who were 
 &lt; 65 years of age, subjects who were 
 ≥ 65 years of age showed a trend toward a higher incidence of worst grade 3 or higher infections (38% versus 24%).</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 123/131 
 one subject in cohort 1, had worst grade 3 tumour lysis syndrome (tls), related to kte-x19occurring concurrently with grade 2 crs, patients are monitored for signs and symptoms of tls and events are managed 
 according to local guidelines. 
 cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anaemia) were critical aes, in particular febrile neutropenia as 
 this represents a high risk of infections (see above). in zuma-2 (combined cohorts) 93% of subjects had 
 cytopenia of any grade; thrombocytopenia (70% of subjects), neutropenia (85% of subjects) and anaemia 65% 
 of subjects). compared with subjects who were &lt; 65 years of age, subjects who were 
 ≥ 65 years of age showed a trend toward a higher incidence of worst grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (56% versus 45%). compared 
 with females, males showed a trend toward a higher incidence of any grade neutropenia (89% versus 73%) and 
 worst grade 3 or higher neutropenia (88% versus 73%). 
 hypogammaglobulinemia was identified in 13 subjects (19%) in cohort 1. 
 in zuma-2 (combined cohorts) 61% of subjects had any grade cardiac arrhythmias and there were 5% of 
 subjects that had cardiac failure.</p><p>
 the most common increased laboratory values are glucose, ast and alt. four subjects met initial laboratory 
 criteria for hy’s law. upon clinical review, an alternate explanation for liver dysfunction was noted in all subjects. 
 thus, no subject was considered to have met criteria for hy’s law. all subjects had decreased laboratory values 
 for haemoglobin, neutrophils, leukocytes, and lymphocytes, and all but 1 subject had decreased laboratory 
 values for platelets. the other most common decreased laboratory values observed were calcium, phosphate 
 and albumin. 
 overall, the unfavourable effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.  
 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>the major limitation for safety assessment of kte-x19 is the limited sample size in the pivotal study zuma-2 including 82 subjects, of which only 68 subjects were administered the recommended dose and with rather short 
 follow up limited to a median of 16.8 months (range: 7.2 to 37.6 months) for cohort1. the applicant has 
 estimated that based on the zuma-2 study adverse drug reactions with a frequency greater than 1 in 27 could 
 be detected if there were no background incidence. this means that only common aes have been captured and 
 that the knowledge about long-term safety is limited. 
 however, since the unfavourable effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class, there are no 
 major concerns arising from these uncertainties and limitations. nevertheless, there are certain limitations of 
 the safety data which need to be followed up. these limitations relate in particular to the influence of age and sex 
 on the incidence and severity of adr. long-term safety data in the study subjects are not available. the 
 applicant committed to further characterise the long-term safety of kte-x19 including secondary malignancies 
 within the post-authorisation obligations.</p><p>
 the applicant agreed to provide additional at least 24-months long-term efficacy and safety data for full analysis 
 set treated patients in the ongoing zuma-2 trial on order to allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the 
 results of pivotal cohort 1 in the zuma-2 study. 
 there is no safety data for use in pregnant and lactating women, in patients with important comorbidity like 
 renal and hepatic impairment or for use in patients with cardiovascular disease and in immunocompromised</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 124/131 
 patients (patients with history of hiv infection, patients with primary immunodeficiency or patients with history of autoimmune disease). there is no safety data for subjects with history of cns lymphoma, brain metastases 
 or history of cns disorders. the above is reflected in the smpc. 
 based on the submitted data the neurological events are generally reversible, though in a few cases there have 
 been lingering minor symptoms. longer term follow-up will be helpful in addressing if neurological adverse 
 reactions are fully reversible or if there are long-term sequelae. similarly, aspects regarding secondary 
 malignancies, replication competent retrovirus analysis will be appropriately assessed in the follow-up study.</p></section><section><header n="3.6">3.6.

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma remains a major cause of morbidity since patients have either limited or have exhausted treatment options. as such, this patient population has a clear unmet medical need 
 for novel therapies.</p><p>
 in cohort 1, the target dose of 2 x 10
 6 cells/kg demonstrated an orr of 85% where the lower confidence interval of 75% was significantly higher than the historical control rate of 25% at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 
 (p&lt;0.001). while orr is reflective of activity of the medicinal product it carries no clinical relevance by itself. 
 however, achieving cr i.e. the disappearance of all measurable evidence of disease is on the other hand 
 considered relevant for the patient and therefore indicative of a relevant favourable effect. the majority of 
 responders (40/56 subjects in the inferential analyses set) achieved a cr, for which durable remissions were 
 observed (median dor nr, 95% ci: 13.6, ne, vs dor in all responders of nr (95% ci: 8.6, ne)). this duration 
 of response compares favourably to the dor reported in the historical cohort. achieving relevant cr in 
 conjunction with a relevant duration of response is considered clinically meaningful and relevant for the patient 
 and therefore important for decision making in the context of a single arm trial.</p><p>
 while surrogacy of achieving sustained remission for os in car t cell therapy is some indication that patients 
 may achieve cure or at least long-term remission, follow-up duration is currently too short to conclude on this 
 issue.</p><p>
 results from secondary endpoints are consistent with the primary endpoint, with median pfs and os not being 
 reached. again, this compares favourably to that reported in the literature and indicates the high response rates 
 may translate into a survival benefit. 
 the main uncertainties regarding the benefit/risk assessment relate to the non-comparative nature of the data, 
 the limited sample size and the short duration of follow up.</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 126/131 
 although a historical control group was used to determine the orr cut-off, there are uncertainties surrounding the way the historical controls were selected and the representativeness of the historic orr for the zuma-2 
 study population. furthermore, the zuma-2 study had numerous amendments and interim analyses, and these 
 may have affected the integrity of the study to a certain extent. however, considering the compelling efficacy 
 estimates for kte-x19, it is not expected they will significantly impact the benefit/risk balance.</p><p>
 all subjects in the zuma-2 study received btk inhibitors. this was also an inclusion criterion in the historical 
 cohort. the benefit of kte-x19 in patients that have not received btk inhibitors is therefore unknown. the 
 indication has been worded to reflect the study population.</p><p>
 the safety profile of kte-x19 was mostly consistent with that reported for other car-t products. the 
 unfavourable effects primarily are cytokine release syndrome, cart-related encephalopathy syndrome, 
 infections and tumour lysis syndrome. cytokine release syndrome (crs) was observed in the majority of 
 subjects (91%) and in subjects &gt;65 years of age, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of worst grade 
 3 crs. furthermore, in subjects &gt;65 years there was also a worst grade 3 or higher neurological events, and 
 worst grade 3 or higher infections. these unfavourable effects are characteristic to the product class and are 
 considered reversible and manageable with appropriate precautions and treatments. the unfavourable effects 
 are in line with the experience with this product class. however, the short duration of follow-up raises an 
 uncertainty whether long-term effects are fully reversible, particularly regarding neurological events and needs 
 to be followed up. 
 the uncertainties and limitation reported above will be captured by the commitments imposed in the frame of 
 the long term follow up study (in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in 
 adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) the mah shall conduct and submit the 
 results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol) and the specific 
 obligation imposed as per the conditional marketing authorisation (see section 3.7.3).</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>the overall benefit/risk balance of kte-x19 for the treatment of r/r mcl in patients which had received more than 2 prior therapy regimens including btk inhibitors is favourable. the benefits for this heavily pre-treated 
 patient population outweighs the unfavourable effects and risks which may be addressed by adequate risk 
 mitigation measures in the rmp. the clinical data are regarded to be not comprehensive due to the 
 uncertainties, not yet addressed by the available data, arising from the short follow-up duration and the limited 
 sample size in view of the non-comparative data. as the benefit of the immediate availability of the atmp 
 outweighs the risks associated with the given uncertainties, there is agreement on granting of a conditional ma 
 (see below). 
 to summarise, the following issues remain: 
 - small population of treated patients (n=68)</p><p>
 - limited proportion of women (n=14)</p><p>
 - possibility of differences in efficacy and safety with regard to gender, age and severely diseased patients. 
 - missing results on long-term efficacy and safety 
 - possible age and gender differences in the pharmacology of kte-x19 and lack of analyses on population 
 pharmacokinetics</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>

 the applicant agrees to provide additional at least 24-months long-term efficacy and safety data for the full analysis set treated patients in the ongoing zuma-2 trial post-authorisation. this is considered an acceptable 
 approach to complete the clinical data and allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the positive benefit-risk 
 balance.</p><p>
 the post-authorisation measurements and obligations within a registry in the scope of a granted conditional 
 approval are deemed adequate to provide information and results concerning the remaining uncertainties on 
 efficacy and safety of the product as described above.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.  
 additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
 conditional marketing authorisation</header><p>as comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the cat/chmp during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant who requested consideration for its 
 application for a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with article 14-a of the above mentioned 
 regulation. 
 the product falls within the scope of article 14-a of regulation (ec) no 726/2004 concerning conditional 
 marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease.</p><p>furthermore, the cat/chmp considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
 authorisation, as follows: 
 • the benefit-risk balance is positive. • it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:</p><p>•</p><p>long-term follow-up data from zuma-2: in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of 
 tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl the mah shall submit the 24 months 
 follow-up data from all treated patients in cohort 1 of the pivotal study zuma-2. expected date for 
 submission of the final data is 31 march 2022 
 •</p><p>a registry-based study: in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult 
 patients with relapsed or refractory mcl and the benefit/risk balance in the female, elderly and 
 severely diseased patients, the mah shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating 
 efficacy and safety based on data from the same registry used to characterise the long-term 
 efficacy and safety of tecartus, according to an agreed protocol. expected date for submission of 
 the final data is 30 september 2025.</p><p>
 these post authorisation studies will provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and safety 
 information on important subgroups (elderly, females, patients with severe disease) which are not fully 
 represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. the provision of this data post authorisation 
 will complement the dossier in order have a comprehensive understanding of efficacy and safety and to 
 confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product. 
 • an unmet medical need will be addressed, as an additional and novel therapeutic option is given for patients with r/r mcl after having received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy including a 
 btk-inhibitor. patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory or who relapsed after two or more 
 lines of approved systemic therapy including bruton’s kinase inhibitors have an overall poor prognosis as 
 few authorised treatment options with established efficacy and safety remain. usually, these patients are</p><p>chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/588798/2020</p><p>
 page 128/131 
 treated by therapy regimens or modifications thereof, they have already received and on which they have relapsed at some point. tecartus provides a treatment option for which a clinically meaningful benefit was 
 demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of response. thus, 
 the availability of tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage vis-à-vis existing treatments. 
 • the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent to the fact that additional data are still required. as benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data is regarded positive, 
 an additional therapy option for mantle cell lymphoma patients with two or more previous systemic 
 therapies is considered beneficial.</p><p>
 in addition, the cat considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow up of safety and efficacy:</p><p>
 in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
 refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) the mah shall conduct and submit the results of a prospective study
