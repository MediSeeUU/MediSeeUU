 overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance</header><p>the proposed changes in this application concern two sections in the smpc for mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, go), section 4.8 and 5.1.</p><p>
 in section 4.8 of the smpc, ‘paediatric aml’, safety results from the systematic literature review of studies 
 evaluating go in paediatric patients are proposed to be presented in tabular format. the new table 7 of the 
 smpc now reports vod, vod post hsct, death, infection, and myelosuppression events by fractionated and 
 non- fractionated, monotherapy and combination therapy settings. 
 in section 5.1 of the smpc, a summary of 17 studies in refractory aml is proposed to be added under the 
 subsection ‘relapsed or refractory aml’. the treatment settings, dosing, and monotherapy vs combination 
 are described. treatment response (cr/crp/cri) from the systematic literature review are proposed to be 
 added.</p><p>
 the data supporting the proposed changes were provided by a review of published studies evaluating safety, 
 activity, and/or efficacy of go in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory aml. the purpose of this 
 systematic review was to identify clinical trials involving go as a monotherapy or in combination with 
 chemotherapy to obtain safety and efficacy data for paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory aml. the 
 application is based on a prisma 2009 systematic literature search. 
 the literature search identified 16 published studies which had been published in peer-reviewed periodicals 
 between 2003 and 2017 and the pfizer-sponsored expanded access study (b1761026). the 17 studies 
 included patients with relapsed or refractory aml, between 5 and 105 patients included, and a total of 454 
 patients treated with go and assessed for safety and efficacy. the overall minimum and maximum ages 
 covered from 0 years to 22.3 years, with an overall median age of 8.7 years at the time of treatment. the 
 line of therapy ranged from combination with standard chemotherapy to compassionate use setting.</p><p>
 the totality of data presented in this application on treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (go) in 
 relapsed/refractory paediatric patients with non-apl aml document an effect of go, as monotherapy or in 
 combination with standard chemotherapy, which is of clinical benefit translated as a state of remission. the 
 remission rate is better in combination therapy than in monotherapy, and the cr may pave the way for 
 allogeneic hsct in a curative intent. no new adverse events or safety issues have emerged, and the serious 
 adverse events of myelosuppression, infection and vod do not appear more common than in the adult 
 population. the fractionated dose schedule may be associated with reduced vod, which is consistent with 
 results for adult patients with relapsed or refractory aml. these adverse events are manageable by routine</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/393390/2019</p><p>
 page 5/11 
 procedures, vod being more frequent in the setting of mylotarg treatment and precautions are routinely implemented during monitoring. death rates reflect the serious clinical circumstances and show variability 
 between studies due to differences of criteria for treatment. this systematic literature review with data of 
 454 paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory aml justifies treatment with go to achieve reults, 
 comparable to those observed in adult patients with relapsed or refractory aml and support the use of go in 
 the paediatric population. 
 the benefit-risk balance of mylotarg remains positive.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.

 5. 
  
 introduction</header><p>mylotarg (go) is a drug-antibody conjugate, developed to be efficient in acute myeloid leukemia (aml). the drug comprises the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin, which has no role in chemotherapy by itself because it is 
 extremely toxic to all cells. it is attached to a monoclonal antibody produced against cd33, which is an 
 antigen expressed on the surface of myeloblasts in up to 90% of aml patients. the toxic effect of 
 calicheamicin is in this way targeting a leukemic clone. the primary metabolic pathway of go is anticipated 
 to be hydrolytic release of n acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. in vitro studies demonstrated 
 that n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is extensively metabolised, primarily via 
 nonenzymatic reduction of the disulphide moiety. the activity (cytotoxicity) of the resultant metabolites is 
 expected to be significantly attenuated. in patients, unconjugated calicheamicin plasma levels were typically 
 low, with a predicted mean cmax of 1.5 ng/ml following the third dose.</p><p>
 the rationale for this variation application was to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the mylotarg smpc with 
 information from a systematic review of studies evaluating safety, activity and/or efficacy of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin in paediatric patients with relapse of, or progressive acute myeloid leukaemia, as requested in 
 the paediatric investigation plan (pip) emea-001733-pip02-15-m01 (measure 4) of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin. the review included study b1761026: study for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (mylotarg) expanded 
 access protocol for treatment of patients in the united states with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous 
 leukemia who may benefit from treatment and have no access to other comparable/alternative therapy. 
 safety data from this study had previously been submitted and assessed (ema/h/c/004202/p46 003).</p></section><section><header n="6">6.

 methods – analysis of data submitted</header><p>the aim of this systematic literature review of 17 studies was also to report anti-leukaemia activity in terms of complete remission (cr) and/or cr with incomplete haematological recovery (cri or crp).</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2.  
 results</header><p>response data were available in 14 studies. in monotherapy studies, most included higher doses of go (&gt;3 mg/m2), 1 study used fractionated dosing. seven studies used go in combination settings: 2 with 
 fractionated dosing (go dose of 3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, and 7), 4 with non-fractionated dosing (1.8 mg/m2 
 to 9.0 mg/m2 given twice during a cycle), and 1 utilised go in both settings. 
 with go monotherapy, the response rate (cr/crp/cri; weighted average across studies) was 33.3% (95% 
 ci: 4.3, 77.7) with fractionated dosing (1 study) and 24.3% (95% ci: 16.4,32.9) with non-fractionated 
 dosing (9 studies). in the combination setting, the response rate was 38.8% (95% ci: 16.0, 63.8) with 
 fractionated go (2 studies) and 49.0% (95% ci: 34.9,63.1) with non-fractionated go (3 studies).</p></section><section><header n="6.3">6.3.

 no significant improvements have been achieved in this millennium by combinations of standard chemotherapy in aml. the addition of a targeted treatment, e.g. by a drug-antibody conjugate like mylotarg 
 represents one of the first therapeutic progress in adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed / 
 refractory aml. the disease biology of paediatric aml appears to be different in the molecular landscape of 
 paediatric patients compared to adults (bolouri et al. nature medicine 2017). the translation of clonality to 
 targeted therapy is in progress by e.g. small-molecule inhibitors, but agents designed to bind a specific 
 epitope on myeloid cells, and by a pathway-independent mode-of –action be able to induce remission, is an 
 additional way to improve treatment options in aml, as proven in adult (ali et al. the oncologist 2018) and 
 now documented in paediatric aml. 
 limitations of this analysis on adverse events / safety and efficacy include the small sample size of some 
 studies, heterogeneity of studies, and lack of control data in this setting. the majority of studies were 
 compassionate use studies or retrospective chart analyses. the remaining were single arm phase 1 and 2 
 studies and one expanded access study, and not formal randomised controlled trials. these studies span 
 from 2003-2017 and therapies and supportive measures have changed over this time. although the data 
 reported across studies were not uniform, efforts were made to extract the relevant data in a consistent 
 manner. not all publications included summary information on infection or myelosuppression. additionally, 
 the data collection periods were not the same between studies. for example, some studies included on 
 treatment death up to 90 days post go and some up to 30 days. 
 the overlaps in ci reporting the results of response rates are considerable, reflecting the study reports. the 
 response rates obtained by addition of go to conventional chemotherapy supports the main conclusion that 
 patients who received the combination of go + chemotherapy achieved higher remission rates than those 
 receiving monotherapy with go. this interpretation is in accordance with observations in adults, and also 
 reflects the differences in the therapeutic approach of intensive therapy (the combination) compared to 
 palliation (monotherapy). however, the results are heterogeneous, often published in small retrospective 
 studies, and have not been assessed with the intention to extent the indication for the treatment with 
 mylotarg in children. however, clinical trials are ongoing in children with aml.</p><p>
 in newly diagnosed paediatric aml, there is the currently ongoing myechild01 phase 3 study (eudract 
 2014-005066-30), as part of a pip for mylotarg, that will determine the maximum number of doses of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin which can safely be combined with intensive induction chemotherapy. 
 in relapsed/refractory paediatric aml a controlled randomized multicenter phase 3 trials is ongoing 
 (eudract 2010-018980-41), initiated by the berlin-frankfurt-münster (bfm) study group as a follow up trial 
 of the phase 2 trial of this study group (zwaan et al., 2010). this study has been planned since 2009 but was 
 not opened until september 2016 and recruited the first patient in august 2017. all patients eligible for this 
 study will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion for the addition or not of a single administration of go at 4.5 
 mg/m² to dx-fla (liposomal daunorubicin + fludarabine + cytarabne) in the first course of re-induction 
 chemotherapy. if go at 4.5 mg/m² proves to be too toxic, the dose will be reduced permanently to 3.0 
 mg/m². primary endpoint will be % bm blasts on day 28 (before the start of the second course). patients who 
 do respond poorly to this first course of chemotherapy with &gt;20% bm blasts on “day 28” (before the start of 
 the second course) become eligible for further phase i/ii clinical studies. all other patients are eligible to 
 proceed to the second re-induction course (fla) as part of the aml-relapse registry (pediatric relapsed aml 
 2010 registry).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 methods – analysis of data submitted</header><p>the aim of this systematic literature review was to report anti-leukaemia activity in terms of adverse events grade ≥3 including myelosuppression, infections, veno-occlusive disease (vod), and deaths during study 
 treatment and in later treatment phases (whenever possible).</p><p>
 the following safety endpoints in terms of number of patients (or percent if number not available) were 
 extracted from the report for this analysis. generally, unless the source explicitly said 0 or no occurrences, 
 it was assumed the data were missing, and no data were recorded.</p><p> 
 • myelosuppression: specifically measured as grade ≥3 neutropenia and separately grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia. if a general comment was given about myelosuppression such as all patients 
 experienced severe myelosuppression, then it was assumed this referred to both neutropenia and 
 thrombocytopenia. additionally, time to recovery of platelets and neutrophils including the study 
 definition of recovery were to be extracted if available. 
 • infections: specifically measured as grade ≥3 infection, and ideally as referred to by the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra) system organ class. since not all data were reported 
 this way, a description of how infections were assessed along with the number of patients 
 experiencing it was collected. 
 • deaths: specifically measured as deaths on treatment where generally, the on-treatment period included up to 30 days after the last dose. study 1026, however, included deaths up until 60 days 
 after last dose of go, and reinhart 2004 included deaths up to 3 months after treatment as deaths 
 on treatment. 
 • vod overall and vod after hsct was recorded. in one instance, there was no mention of vod, but it had been assumed no vod occurred (dyshlevaya 2008) due to the setting of the study. 
 the mah has also presented data on treatment differences dosing of go (fractionated and non-fractionated) 
 both as monotherapy and in combination in patients who underwent hsct prior to go and after go and vod 
 after allogeneic hsct.</p></section><section><header n="7.2">7.2.  
 results</header></section><section><header>myelosuppression</header><p>myelosuppression data were available in 9 studies and almost all patients (&gt;90%) experienced myelosuppression. in study b1761026 myelosuppression was reported in approximately 60% of patients, 
 possibly due to the collection of only grade ≥3 aes. only 2 studies measured recovery time for platelets and 
 neutrophils. platelet recovery was defined in the studies as 20 x 109/l or 50 x 109/l respectively and 
 neutrophil recovery was defined as 0.5 x 109/l in both studies. median time to recovery ranged from 42-48 
 days for platelets and 30-37 days for neutrophils (systematic literature review 2018).</p></section><section><header>infection</header><p>four studies documented grade ≥3 infection and an additional 5 studies had alternative descriptions of infections (severe, secondary, serious documented, and blood stream bacterial infections, and infection). 
 for go monotherapy, the infection rate across studies was estimated at 36.1% and for go in combination 
 with chemotherapy it was 44.1%. when all measures of infection were combined, the estimated rate was 
 28.4% with monotherapy (5 studies) and 42.2% in combination therapy (4 studies). hence, infections 
 appeared to be more common with go given in combination with chemotherapy; though given the</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/393390/2019</p><p>
 page 9/11 
 heterogeneity between studies in how infections were measured, these results should be interpreted with caution (systematic literature review 2018).</p></section><section><header>veno-occlusive disease</header><p>rates of vod were available for all 17 studies. estimated vod rates across 10 studies using non-fractionated dosing monotherapy were 6.8%, ranging from rates of 0-50%. in combination therapy using 
 non-fractionated go dosing, across 5 studies, the estimated rate for vod was 4.4% with rates ranging from 
 0%-42.9%. in 3 fractionated dosing studies (1 monotherapy and 2 in combination), no vod was reported. 
 these observations are in alignment with rates of vod observed in pivotal and supportive studies. in all 
 studies, the number of patients who were able to receive further treatment in the form of stem cell 
 transplant varied greatly (0-100%).</p><p>
 vod assessment post-transplant was available in 12 studies. in the monotherapy setting with 
 non-fractionated dosing, the estimated rate of vod was 19.1% post-hsct across 5 studies. in the 
 combination setting with non-fractionated dosing, there were only 2 studies, and the estimated rate was 
 14.7%. in the combination setting with fractionated doing, in 2 studies, there were no vod cases reported 
 (systematic literature review 2018).</p></section><section><header>deaths on treatment</header><p>ten studies reported data about deaths on treatment. in the majority of studies, on last dose of go, but some included deaths 60 studies of non-fractionated go monotherapy that included death up to 30 days

 as monotherapy, there were no on the combination setting in the 3 studies that included death up to 30 days

 discussion</header><p>the go therapy is associated with a toxicity, which however is acceptable in the context of a lethal disease, which has a dubious prognosis in most cases also in children.</p><p>
 the smpc update is based on literature review with the safety data restricted to the specific events of 
 myelosuppression, infections, vod overall and vod post-hsct, and death. results should be interpreted 
 cautiously given the identified limitations of the data (small sample size of some studies, heterogeneity of 
 the studies, and the lack of control data in this setting). safety data from study b1761026 csr (study for 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin (mylotarg) expanded access protocol for treatment of patients in the united 
 states with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia who may benefit from treatment and have 
 no access to other comparable/alternative therapy) previously submitted and assessed 
 (ema/h/c/004202/p46 003) are not included in the smpc. at that time, it was concluded that due to the 
 limitations of the data (confounding factors such as underlying disease, myelosuppression or chemotherapy 
 related effects), a change in the smpc with regards to this safety information was not recommended. 
 further safety monitoring of adrs including those for renal toxicity, hypoxia, hypokalaemia; and febrile 
 neutropenia in the combination therapy was requested.</p><p>
 these before mentioned limitations also apply to the currently submitted data. however, given that the 
 safety data are restricted to frequently occurring events well known for mylotarg, inclusion in the smpc can 
 be acceptable, provided that inclusion of information is restricted to factual information only. in addition, it 
 should be explicitly stated that the search for safety results in the literature was restricted to the specific 
 events of myelosuppression, infections, vod overall and vod post-hsct, and death (4.8 and 5.1). 
 moreover, there is evidence that vod rates both in treatment and post-hsct were lower with fractionated 
 dosing both in monotherapy and combination therapy. the mah considers that fractionated dose schedule</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/393390/2019</p><p>
 page 10/11 
 may be associated with a reduced incidence of vod, which is consistent with results for adult patients with relapsed or refractory aml. this interpretation is cautiously supported. 
 in conclusion, the data presented in this prisma based literature search are encumbered with caveats due 
 to different dosing, criteria and sample size but the interpretation is acceptable due to available results in a 
 relatively large and representative paediatric patient population in total.</p></section><section><header n="8">8.

 (5.7% of patients); median age was 9.7 years (range: 0.003-29.8 years), patients with 
 de novo aml were randomly assigned to either standard 5-course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with 2 
 doses of mylotarg (3 mg/m
 2/dose) administered once in induction course 1 and once in intensification course 2. the study demonstrated that addition of mylotarg to intensive chemotherapy improved efs (3 
 years: 53.1% versus</p><p>46.9%; hr 0.83; 95% ci: 0.70, 0.99; p=0.04) in 
 de novo aml owing to a reduced relapse risk, with a trend towards longer os in the mylotarg arm which was not statistically significant 
 (3 years: 69.4% versus</p><p>65.4%; hr 0.91; 95% ci: 0.74, 1.13; p=0.39). however, it was also found that 
 increased toxicity (post-remission toxic mortality) was observed in patients with low-risk aml which was 
 attributed to the prolonged neutropenia that occurred after receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin during 
 intensification course 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). thus, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for 
 paediatric patients was not established (see section 4.2).</p></section><section><header>relapsed or refractory aml 
  
 a systematic literature review of studies was conducted to evaluate mylotarg in paediatric 
 patients with relapsed or refractory aml, which included 454 patients receiving mylotarg 
 either as a monotherapy (single or fractionated dosing) or combination therapy from 16 
 published papers plus the us expanded access study (see section 4.8). the median study size 
 was 15 patients, with a range of 5-105 patients. the overall minimum and maximum ages range 
 from 0 years to 22.3 years, with an overall median age of 8.7 years at the time of treatment. 
  
 most studies were in the compassionate use setting (70.6%). mylotarg was given as 
 monotherapy in 47.1%, part of a combination in 23.5%, and in both settings in 29.4% of the 
 studies. total dosing of mylotarg ranged from 1.8 mg/m</header><p>2</p></section><section><header>to 9 mg/m</header><p>2</p></section><section><header n="">. when mylotarg was given in combination, a cytarabine based regimen was used in 8 of the 9 studies. in 23.5% of 
 the studies the majority of patients received fractionated (3 mg/m</header><p>2</p></section><section><header>on day 1, 4, 7) doses of mylotarg, while in 35.3% of the studies doses higher than 3 mg/m</header><p>2</p></section><section><header>were given. mylotarg was given as induction treatment in most studies (82.4%). 
  
 with mylotarg monotherapy, the response rate (cr/crp/cri; weighted average across 
 studies) was 33.3% with fractionated dosing (1 study) and 24.3% with non-fractionated dosing 
 (9 studies). in the combination setting, the response rate was 49.0% with non-fractionated 
 mylotarg (3 studies) and 38.8% with fractionated mylotarg (2 studies).  
  
 safety information on myelosuppression, infections, vod overall and vod post-hsct, and 
 death, which are known adverse events for mylotarg (see section 4.8 and table 7), was 
 obtained from literature.  
  
 limitations of this analysis include the small sample size of some studies, heterogeneity of the 
 studies, and the lack of control data in this setting.</header></section></body></xml>
