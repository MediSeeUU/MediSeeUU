 disease or condition</header><p>mylotarg is intended for the treatment of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years and adult patients with previously untreated, de novo cd33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), except acute promyelocytic 
 leukaemia (apl), in combination therapy with daunorubicin (dnr) and cytarabine (arac).</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention</header><p>in europe, the annual incidence of aml in adults is 5 to 8 cases per 100.000 individuals with a mortality rate of 4 to 6 cases per 100.000. (1) the median age at diagnosis is 67 years, but the incidence increases 
 by age with a projected incidence of 15 to 25 cases per 100.000 in patients who are 70 years of age or 
 older. (2) (3)</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 biologic features</header><p>acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia, characterised by infiltration of proliferative, clonal, abnormally differentiated, and occasionally poorly differentiated haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage 
 in the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.  
 clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>aml is a heterogeneous disease; the classification is based on morphologic, cytogenetic, molecular, and immunophenotypic features, which, along with baseline patient characteristics such as age and 
 performance status (ps), influence outcome and treatment recommendations (4). among these, baseline 
 cytogenetic risk constitutes one of the most significant prognostic markers of disease outcome (5). age is 
 the most prominent patient-specific risk factor, and cytogenetics the most disease-specific risk factor. 
 in aml, leukaemic blasts replace normal blood cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which leads to 
 anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. this is associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of 
 breath, disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. if left untreated, aml results in death within a 
 few weeks to months. 
 long-term survival in adult patients with aml is only 35% to 40% for patients ≤60 years of age, and 
 drops to 5% to 15% in patients who are &gt;60 years of age. (6) the majority of patients with aml will have 
 relapsed disease within 3 years. (7)</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header><p>the general therapeutic strategy in patients with aml has not changed substantially in more than 30 years. the standard regimen ‘‘3+7’’, established in 1973, consisted of 3 consecutive daily infusions of 
 dnr and 7 days of continuous infusion of arac.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 10/138</p><p> 
 the standard treatment has for many years consisted of an induction treatment in order to achieve complete remission (cr). when cr has been obtained, 2 courses of consolidation therapy usually are 
 performed, in order to eliminate undetected residual disease. patient who do not achieve cr after the 
 induction have a poor prognosis. although some patients older than 60 years, with ecog ps 0 to 2 and 
 minimal comorbidity may benefit from standard 3+7, the therapeutic options for patients with poor 
 functional status or comorbidities often include low intensity therapy such as subcutaneous arac, 
 azacitidine, or decitabine. the majority of patients with aml whether in cr after consolidation therapy or 
 not, will have relapsed disease within 3 years. achievements in the treatment of aml have mainly focused 
 on younger patients. the introduction of allogeneic stem cell transplantation has improved the outcome 
 in selected patient groups, especially those with intermediate and high risk disease with 3 years lfs of 
 60%. however patients who are not in remission at the time of transplantation have a dismal prognosis. 
 it is of clinical benefit, that patients achieve cr are risk stratified in order to select those patients that 
 might benefit from an hsct.</p><p>
 in the eu (european union), recently approved agents include decitabine (dacogen) which is authorised 
 for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary aml, according to the 
 world health organisation (who) classification, who are not candidates for standard induction 
 chemotherapy. azacitidine (vidaza) is also authorised for the treatment of adult patients vidaza is 
 indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell 
 transplantation (hsct) with aml with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to who 
 classification and aml with &gt;30% marrow blasts according to the who classification. in addition, 
 histamine dihydrochloride (ceplene) is authorised for adult patients with aml in first remission 
 concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (il-2). finally, midostaurin (rydapt) is authorised in 
 combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation 
 chemotherapy followed by midostaurin single agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly 
 diagnosed aml who are flt3 mutation positive. 
 still new therapeutic options that could improve survival of patients, and prevent or delay relapse of the 
 disease remain an important unmet medical need for patients with previously untreated de novo aml.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a cd33-directed adc. gemtuzumab is a humanised immunoglobulin class g subtype 4 (igg4) antibody which specifically recognises human cd33. the antibody portion binds 
 specifically to the cd33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid 
 leukaemic blasts and immature normal cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal 
 haematopoietic stem cells. the small molecule, n acetyl gamma calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic 
 semisynthetic natural product. n acetyl gamma calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via 
 an acbut (4-(4-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid) linker. non-clinical data suggest that the anticancer 
 activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is due to the binding of the adc to cd33-expressing tumour cells, 
 followed by internalisation of the adc cd33 complex, and the intracellular release of n acetyl gamma 
 calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. activation of n acetyl gamma 
 calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide induces double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) breaks, 
 subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. (smpc, section 5.1). 
 the applicant requested the approval for the following indication: 
 mylotarg is a cd33-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for combination therapy with 
 daunorubicin (dnr) and cytarabine (arac) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated, 
 de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (aml).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 11/138</p><p> 
 the final indications following chmp review of this application is: mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (dnr) and cytarabine (arac) for the 
 treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo cd33-positive acute 
 myeloid leukaemia (aml), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl) (smpc, section 4.1). 
 for the induction phase, the recommended dose of mylotarg is 3 mg/m
 2/dose (up to a maximum of one 5 mg vial) infused over a 2 hour period on days 1, 4, and 7 in combination with dnr 60 mg/m2/day 
 infused over 30 minutes on day 1 to day 3, and arac 200 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on day 1 to 
 day 7. mylotarg should not be administered during second induction therapy (smpc, section 4.2). 
 for the consolidation phase, for patients experiencing a complete remission (cr) following induction, 
 defined as fewer than 5% blasts in a normocellular marrow and an absolute neutrophil count (anc) of 
 more than 1.0 × 10
 9 cells/l with a platelet count of 100 × 109/l or more in the peripheral blood in the absence of transfusion, up to 2 consolidation courses of intravenous dnr (60 mg/m
 2 for 1 day [first course] or 2 days [second course]) in combination with intravenous arac (1,000 mg/m
 2 per 12 hours, infused over 2 hours on day 1 to day 4) with intravenous mylotarg (3 mg/m
 2/dose infused over 2 hours up to a maximum dose of one 5 mg vial on day 1) are recommended (smpc, section 4.2).</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>the applicant had chmp scientific advice in february 2016 (emea/h/sa/3285/1/2016/pa/i) on the proposed data package to demonstrate acceptable product quality in relation to the amino acid

 although this dossier is not considered a quality by design application, certain elements of an enhanced 
 approached were applied as described in the relevant sections below. 
 mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) has been in commercial production and on the market in the us from 
 2000-2010 and again in 2017, and in japan since 2005. the current application is a re-submission. in 
 2007, the chmp considered that the quality package for mylotarg was generally acceptable. during 
 development, a significant level of amino acid substitution (aas) was discovered at multiple sites within 
 the antibody part of the active substance. the root cause of the aas was identified. primarily based on the 
 aas observed, several major deficiencies, two joint with clinical, were identified in the initial quality 
 package submitted in support of the marketing authorisation application (maa). none of the clinical 
 studies supporting the current maa used exclusively elevated aas gemtuzumab batches, and as such do 
 not fully represent the proposed commercial product. during the review, the applicant has provided 
 additional data confirming the comparability of the clinical material with the proposed commercial</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 active substance</header><p>gemtuzumab ozogamicin (mylotarg) is an antibody drug conjugate (adc) of humanized cd33-directed monoclonal igg4 antibody covalently bonded to the activated calicheamicin derivative, a semi-synthetic 
 derivative of gamma calicheamicin.</p><p>
 gemtuzumab was selected to target cd33 expressed on the majority of leukemic cells from patients with 
 acute myeloid leukemia (aml); it has an average theoretical molecular mass of 148 kdaltons. 
 calicheamicin is a potent cytotoxin that, once conjugated to the anti-cd33 monoclonal antibody, allows 
 target directed therapy. the calicheamicin is bound to the antibody via a linker which forms an amide 
 bond with the antibody and forms a disulfide bond with the calicheamicin. the linker also contains an 
 internal hydrazone bond, which is acid-labile.</p><p>

 discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>several major deficiencies were identified in the initial quality package submitted in support of the mylotarg maa. all issues regarding the quality for mylotarg were satisfactorily addressed and are now

 primarily based on the aas observed, several major deficiencies were identified in the initial quality 
 package submitted in support of the mylotarg maa. none of the clinical studies supporting the current</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 20/138</p><p> 
 mylotarg maa used exclusively elevated aas gemtuzumab batches, and as such do not fully represent the proposed commercial product. the fraction of gemtuzumab ozogamicin batches used in the clinical 
 studies displaying elevated levels of aas increased according to the accrual period of the studies. in the 
 original submission, it was stated that it is not possible to perform heightened characterisation of the 
 original product using state-of-the art orthogonal methods, due to unavailability of sufficient material, so 
 comparability studies were limited in scope.</p><p>this was considered a major deficiency.</p><p>
 the root cause of the aas was identified. since the evidence to fully support this was not sufficient, a 
 major objection was raised to fully investigate the impact of several parameters on aas levels. data 
 provided in the dossier suggest that changes to the production process could be implemented to eradicate 
 the aas and provide an antibody moiety with a consistent primary sequence; since the applicant has 
 stated that this change would take time, it has committed to implement a new, improved process for 
 gemtuzumab, designed to reduce aas and improve consistency post-approval.</p><p>
 a major objection (comprising part of a joint clinical mo) was raised regarding the potential impact of the 
 aas on the functional activity of mylotarg. cd33 and fcrn binding between pre- and post-aas shift 
 batches was shown to be comparable on the whole. additional data provided by the applicant also provide 
 further evidence that no new sites for calicheamicin conjugation are introduced as a result of the aas.</p><p>
 another major objection (comprising part of a second joint clinical mo) was raised regarding the use of 
 batches with basal levels of aas in the pivotal clinical trial. the applicant has now demonstrated 
 convincingly that, except for the aas, there is overall comparability at the quality level between pre- and 
 post-aas shift batches, and this point is considered resolved.</p><p>
 a major objection regarding comparability of gemtuzumab throughout development is also considered 
 resolved. additional data provided by the applicant, which comprises a mixture of new data and a more 
 thorough presentation of comparative data allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the relative 
 quality attributes of pre- and post-aas shift batches. no significant differences are found in binding to the 
 cd33 target. glycosylation, aggregation, and stability of the antibody are considered comparable. no new 
 sites of conjugation were found, and the low conjugated and unconjugated fractions were found 
 comparable. the provided data support the notion that the aas has not had any significant effect on the 
 critical quality attributes of mylotarg and its functionality, as far as can be ascertained from analyses of 
 quality attributes. a further major objection was raised regarding process robustness. data provided in 
 the initial submission suggested that the process may not be sufficiently robust to withstand any 
 necessary future changes to the manufacturing process which might therefore lead to further variation in 
 aas or other quality attributes. the applicant has provided a substantial amount of process performance 
 data. important changes have been made to the control process, including increased testing and control 
 of starting/raw materials as well as introducing new in process controlsand a general tightening of process 
 controls and acceptance criteria for release.</p><p>
 in summary, several major objections and a number of other concerns were raised. all issues regarding 
 the quality for mylotarg were satisfactorily addressed and are now resolved.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.5">2.2.5.

 biacore surface plasmon resonance (spr) (rpt-56053). hp67.6 antibody exhibited a high affinity for 
 cd33, with an average kd of 0.073 nm. this high affinity was not compromised by conjugation of 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh via the acbut linker to hp67.6 antibody where the kd of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin was 0.082 nm.</p><p>
 binding to a cd33-positive leukaemia cell line 
 the relative binding affinity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to a cd33-positive tumour cell line was 
 determined in a competitive radioimmunoassay using hel 92.1.7 erythroleukemia cells (miracl-26754). 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin had an ec50 value of 11.6 nm (1.69 µg/ml) which was comparable to 11.9 nm 
 (1.73 µg/ml) for the hp67.6 ab which confirmed that conjugation of the linker-payload to the hp67.6 
 antibody does not alter its binding affinity to the cells (table 1). 
 binding to normal peripheral blood and bone marrow cells 
 binding characteristics of hp67.6 antibody and gemtuzumab ozogamicin were evaluated in peripheral 
 blood and normal bone marrow cells from 5 allogeneic transplant donors as compared by flow cytometry 
 (miracl-27251). while this study examined a very small sample size, overall, there does not appear to 
 be a substantial difference in the binding characteristics with regard to cellular specificity for hp67.6

 binding and internalization analysis of two radio iodinated anti-human cd33 antibodies, hp67.6 and m195 
 benchmark antibody (8) was conducted with the cd33-expressing hl-60 cell line (gtr-36629). a 
 published study of 315 leukemic bone marrow samples showed the highest concentration of cd33 in aml 
 samples, with an average of 10,000 and a range of 700 to 55,000 copies per cell (9). these results were 
 confirmed in hl-60 cell where the cd33 expression was estimated to be 22,000 molecules per cell 
 (gtr-36629). the results indicated that 45 to 55% of the initially-bound hp67.6 was internalized over 22 
 hours at 37˚c. a separate electron microscopy study (gtr-36630) confirmed that trafficking of mp67.11

 hydrolysis in the acidic environment. the rate of hydrolysis of n-ac-γ- calicheamicin dmh was studied 
 across a ph range (4.5, 6.0, and 7.4) (miracl-26756). the gemtuzumab ozogamicin sample did not 
 show significant decomposition at ph 7.4. however, the adc was relatively unstable at a ph value of 4.5,</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 23/138</p><p> 
 which approximates the ph of a lysosome, and approximately half of the observed release of n-ac-γ calicheamicin dmh occurred in approximately 6 hours. payload release at a ph value of 4.5, but not 7.4, 
 is consistent with the therapeutic rationale. 
 activation of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh by glutathione 
 following hydrolysis of the hydrazone moiety in the acbut linker, the released n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh 
 must be activated in order to damage dna. prior studies have shown that the dna cleavage reaction 
 requires a reducing agent, and in its absence the calicheamicin binds to dna with no destructive effect 
 (10). gsh, an abundant constituent of the cytoplasm, has been shown to react readily with 
 γ-calicheamicin to form an active dna-damaging agent at concentrations that would be found in the cell 
 (myers et al, 1994). n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh was designed to improve the stability of the disulfide 
 bond.</p><p>
 the activated, dna-damaging product, the diradical form of n-ac-
 ε-calicheamicin, is formed following exposure of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh to gsh. results of a study showed that the formation of 
 n-ac-
 ε-calicheamicin appeared to be directly proportional to the concentration of gsh in the reaction mixture (rpt-50556). the concentration of glutathione outside of cells in general circulation has been 
 found to be in the low micromolar range (11);while, for example, the concentration of gsh in rat 
 hepatocytes is 5 mm in the cytosol and as high as 20 mm in the nucleus. (12) the results of this study 
 suggest that n-ac-
 ε-calicheamicin can be produced without any enzymatic facilitation. in addition, the reaction of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh with glutathione was low at slightly acidic phs but robust at a 
 physiological ph values of 7.4.</p><p>
 in vitro cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin the cytotoxic activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was compared to n-ac-γ calicheamicin dmh and n-ac-γ 
 calicheamicin dmh acbut in cd33-positive hl-60 and cd33-negative raji cell lines (miracl-26753). 
 potent cytotoxic activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was observed for cd33-positive cells (ic50 of 0.3 pm 
 calicheamicin payload, or 0.46 pg/ml calicheamicin equivalents) and a selectivity index of 77,609 for 
 cd33-positive versus cd33-negative cells. gemtuzumab ozogamicin had greater potency when 
 compared to non-specific cytotoxicity of n-ac-γ calicheamicin dmh and n-ac-γ calicheamicin dmh acbut 
 (ic50 values of 6.4 and 13.0 nm calicheamicin payload, or 9.2 and 18.6 ng/ml calicheamicin equivalents, 
 respectively) for cd33-positive cells. cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was also compared to a 
 non-binding murine plasmacytoma mab control antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, mopc-21, in 
 hl-60 and raji cells (miracl-26749 and miracl-26900). gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 10,500 times 
 more cytotoxic to hl-60 compared to the mopc-21 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate. the cytotoxic 
 effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were also investigated comparing cells with high levels of cd33 
 (hl60, nomo-1, nb4, and nkm-1), low cd33- positive (k562), and no cd33 (daudi), as well as 
 p-gp-expressing cell lines, mono-1/adr (adriamycin-resistant subline) and nb4/mdr (mdr1 
 dna-transfected (gtr-37661). concentration-dependent, cd33-directed cytotoxicity was observed 
 (ic50 approximately 0.084 nm calicheamicin payload) in the cell lines tested. gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
 had cytotoxic activity against mono-1/adr and nb4/ mdr only in the presence of mdr inhibitors, ms209 
 and psc833 (ic50 ranged from 0.175 to 17.5 nm).</p><p>
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin activity in primary human leukaemic bone marrow samples 
 in order to assess the ability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to inhibit cell growth from progenitor cells in 
 patients, colony forming cell growth was assessed in diagnostic blood or bone marrow specimens from 
 patients with aml and normal healthy donors (miracl-26757). inhibition of colony growth was observed 
 in all gemtuzumab ozogamicin treated samples. in the 27 samples incubated with 7.0 nm gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin, 15 had &gt;25% inhibition of which 12 had &gt;60% inhibition, while in samples incubated with</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 24/138</p><p> 
 1.4 nm gemtuzumab ozogamicin 10 had &gt;25% inhibition of which 4 with &gt;60% inhibition. normal bone marrow samples (n=3) were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin of 7 to 28 nm calicheamicin payload 
 and showed no inhibition of colony growth. non-specific inhibition of colony formation was observed after 
 aml patient samples were treated with 70 nm calicheamicin payload of a non-targeting hctm01control 
 but not at lower doses.</p><p>
 in vivo pharmacodynamics antitumor effects of single dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the hl-60 xenograft model the 
 in vivo antitumor effects of a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were studied in a cd33-positive hl-60 xenograft model (miracl-26749 and miracl-26900). athymic mice (n = 5 per test group; n = 10 
 for the saline control group) were dosed ip with 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg/m
 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 8 days after subcutaneous implantation of tumour cells. a single dose of 120 mg/m
 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin resulted in 20% survival. the 30 mg/m
 2 dose resulted in 100% survival with 40% of the mice tumour-free, while at 60 and 90 mg/m
 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin, survival was 80%, with 60% of the mice tumour free. single dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin showed antitumor efficacy but had a poor 
 survival rate at higher doses in mice at the doses tested; therefore, a fractionated dosing approach was 
 explored as a possible improvement to the dosing regimen. athymic mice implanted with hl-60 tumours 
 allowed to grow to approximately 150 mg (n= 5 per test group, n = 10 in the saline control group) were 
 given 3 ip doses once every four days (q4dx3) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on days 7, 11, and 15 after 
 tumour implantation for total doses of 9, 18, 54, and 108 mg/m
 2 (miracl-26749 and miracl-26900). in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin-treated mice, 100% survival was observed following administration of 9, 
 18, and 54 mg/m
 2 doses. after doses of 9 and 18 mg/m2, 40% of the animals were tumour free while 60% were tumour free in the 54 mg/m
 2 dose group at study termination. after administration of 108 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 60% of the animals survived and were also tumour free at day 37. in the 
 saline-treated control group, there was no antitumor activity by day 37. a separate experiment with the 
 same q4dx3 dosing regimen of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in mice bearing larger 200 mg hl-60 tumours 
 resulted in complete tumour regression and 100% survival at 18, 54, and 108 mg/m
 2 total doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered q4dx3.</p><p>
 a study comparing gemtuzumab ozogamicin and a control adc (n-ac-γ calicheamicin dmh acbut 
 conjugated to a non-binding murine plasmacytoma control antibody, mopc-21) was conducted with 
 q4dx3 ip administration for total doses of 9, 18, 54, and 108 mg/m
 2 in the hl60 xenograft model (n= 5 per group, 150 mg tumours) in athymic mice. tumour growth inhibition of &gt;80% was observed across all 
 4 gemtuzumab ozogamicin doses. all mice survived at 9, 18, and 54 mg/m
 2, while 2 deaths were observed at the 108 mg/m
 2 dose. in contrast, treatment with the mopc-21 conjugate resulted in &lt;20% tumour growth inhibition across all of the 4 doses, and 100% lethality was observed at the 108 mg/m
 2 dose. therefore, the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in this tumour model was dependent on the cd33-directing properties of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
 antitumor effects of low doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered iv in the hl-60 xenograft 
 tumor model 
 more recent studies evaluated efficacy over a lower dose range and nod/scid mice were followed for a 
 much longer period, 124 days (030406). total doses of 1.2, 3.6, and 12 mg/m
 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin were administered in a subcutaneous hl60 xenograft model in immune-compromised nod/scid mice. 
 mice (n = 10) with staged tumours (average volume 225 mm
 3) received 4 iv doses every 4 days (q4dx4) of either a non-binding calicheamicin conjugated antibody control or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. treatment 
 with 12 mg/m
 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused sustained tumour regressions, with only 2 animals presenting tumor relapse around day 45 and day 80. six (6) out of 10 animals remaining on study at day</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 25/138</p><p> 
 100 were tumour free. treatment with a non-binding control adc at 12 mg/m2 caused only transient reduction in tumour volume, and tumours relapsed at day 32. the 3.6 mg/m
 2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin delayed tumour growth significantly, but the tumours eventually relapsed and these animals 
 were taken off study by day 37. in contrast, the tumors of all animals in the non-binding adc control 
 group at 3.6 mg/m
 2 progressed, and all animals had to be taken off the study by day 16 due to tumour burden. there was no observed efficacy in the group dosed with 1.2 mg/m
 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.</p><p>antitumor effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with daunorubicin/ cytarabine (da) 
 chemotherapy in aml xenograft models with leukemic stem cell outgrowth 
 the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with conventional chemotherapy has showed significant 
 improvement in the overall survival of aml patients (13) (14). however, when da therapy was 
 administered alone, despite early anti-leukemic responses, a high percentage of disease recurrence was 
 observed. this has been attributed to the outgrowth of chemo-resistant lscs characterized by their 
 inherent ability for self-renewal (15) bm0407 and bm2407 pdx and human aml cell line (mv4-11-luc) 
 disseminated disease models in nod/scid mice were used to compare the antileukemic activity of da 
 chemotherapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, and the combination of both therapies (study 
 082753).</p><p>
 high dose da chemotherapy (cytarabine at 15 mg/kg subcutaneously daily for 5 days and daunorubicin 
 at 1.5 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5) resulted in elimination of human aml cd33+cd45+ blasts in the 
 peripheral blood, but residual disease remained in the bone marrow. combining da chemotherapy with 
 go compared to either therapy alone resulted in nearly complete elimination of cd33+/cd45+ human 
 tumor cells from both the peripheral blood and bone marrow. in the mv4-11-luc disseminated model, the 
 go/da combination also showed a statistically-significant increase in survival compared to da or go 
 monotherapies.</p><p>
 the combinatorial effect of da and gemtuzumab ozogamicin was further tested in the aml bm0407 pdx 
 disseminated model where da (cytarabine at 10 mg/kg sc on days 1-5 and 22-26 and daunorobucin at 
 1 mg/kg iv on days 1, 3, 5, 22, 24, and 26) or gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy (at a dose of 0.06 
 mg/kg per dose on day 1 and 22, or 0.36 mg/m
 2 total dose, which is lower than the dose required for complete elimination of cd33+cd45+ blasts from the bone marrow) caused partial inhibition of leukemic 
 growth, while the combination of da with gemtuzumab ozogamicin completely depleted the 
 cd33+/cd45+ amls from the bone marrow.</p><p>
 aml pdx models, bm2407 and bm0407, were established in immunocompromised mice, and following da 
 chemotherapy, the residual disease, as measured by the percentage of cd33+/cd45+ blasts in the bone 
 marrow, were analysed for expression of several cell surface markers associated with lscs. in the 
 bm2407 pdx model, cd34+ cells were enriched in the residual disease and characterized as a potential 
 lsc marker, while in the bm0407 model, a cll1+/cl117-population was enriched and identified as a 
 potential lsc phenotype. the residual aml blasts in the bone marrow of bm0407 and bm2407 models 
 treated with da were sorted into subpopulations using potential lsc markers and retransplanted into a 
 separate cohort of naïve mice to monitor for tumour engraftment. in the bm2407 model, cd33+/cd45+ 
 were further sorted into cd34+ and cd34- cells. implanting 2 x 105 or 6 x 105 cd33+/cd34+ cells 
 resulted in all mice (5/5) developing bone marrow leukaemia burden. in contrast, cd33+/cd34- cells 
 failed to engraft in any of the mice regardless of the cell concentration. similarly, in the bm0407 model, 
 when 1 x 105 of the sorted cll1+/cd117- cells were injected into mice, all of the mice (5/5) developed 
 bone marrow leukemic cd33+/cd45+ blast. on the contrary, the cll1+/cd117+ cells failed to engraft 
 in mice.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 (n-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin-dmhherg). at concentrations up to 6.77 µm, &lt;1% inhibition of the 
 herg current amplitude was observed. the ic50 value for herg current inhibition was not determined 
 because concentrations greater than 6.77 µm (10,000 ng/ml) could not be tested.</p><p>
 in vitro, gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a concentration of 0.75 µg/ml calicheamicin equivalents caused no noticeable changes in spontaneous motility or contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, 
 serotonin, or barium chloride in isolated guinea pig ileum (gtr-37315).</p><p>
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in mice, rats, and dogs after a single iv administration. potential 
 effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on the cns (mice, rats), digestive system (mice), kidney function 
 (mice), and hepatic function (rats) were evaluated. potential cardiovascular effects were evaluated in 
 dogs. gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused no noticeable changes in gross activity or behaviour of mice, and 
 no effects on spontaneous locomotor activity, potentiation of convulsions, on pain threshold, 
 gastrointestinal transit, or changes in urinary volume or urinary electrolytes at doses of ≤30 mg/m
 2. gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered to rats at ≤21 mg/m
 2 had no effect on body temperature compared with the control group, and caused no noticeable changes in the excretion of sodium 
 bromosulphalein indicating no effect on hepatic function (gtr-37315).</p><p>
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered iv to male mice (20/group) at doses of 3, 9, or 30 mg

 2 and pooled urine samples from each cage (5 animals/cage, 4 cages/group) was collected over 5 hours. gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused no noticeable changes in urine volume or urinary excretion of 
 electrolytes (gtr-37316). 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered to conscious beagle dogs at doses of 4 (30-minute infusion), 
 13 (30-minute infusion), or 40 (bolus) mg/m
 2 (miracl-26834). following bolus injection at 40 mg/m2, there was a reduction in cardiac output at 5 to 10 minutes postdose that gradually returned to baseline by 
 40 minutes post dose. a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was also observed at 5 to 20 minutes 
 post dose, and was likely secondary to the reduction in cardiac output. heart rate increased following 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration which appeared to be a reflexive response to maintain cardiac 
 output. heart rate was also increased at 13 mg/m
 2. there were no effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on hemodynamic or cardiac function at 4 mg/m

 was characterized by moderate systemic cl and high vss. after iv administration of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh acbut to rats, the pk of the calicheamicin equivalents was characterized by low cl and a low to 
 moderate vss. pk parameters could not be determined in rats or dogs administered n-ac-

 the tk of hp67.6 antibody, total calicheamicin, and/or unconjugated calicheamicin and the presence of 
 ada were assessed for up to 6 weeks (1 dose/week) in male and female sprague-dawley rats 
 (miracl-26813) or male and/or female cynomolgus monkeys (miracl-26812; gtr-27677) after iv 
 administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin or hp67.6 antibody alone. mean systemic hp67.6 antibody 
 and/or total calicheamicin auc exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner in rats and monkeys 
 after single- and/or repeat-dose administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. plasma concentrations of 
 unconjugated calicheamicin were typically below the limit of quantitation (blq) and were only observed 
 in the high dose group from each species. after repeat-dose administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 
 the total incidence of ada-positive animals was 95% in rats and 8.3% to 33% in monkeys. due to the 
 high incidence of ada in the 6-week repeat-dose rat toxicity study, time-dependent changes in exposure 
 could not be assessed in these species. in the 6-week repeat-dose comparative toxicity study in 
 monkeys, accumulation of hp67.6 antibody was observed after repeated administration of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin or hp67.6 antibody, with auc168 accumulation ratios ranging from 2.3 to 2.7. mean, 
 dose-normalized systemic exposure to hp67.6 antibody was similar in monkeys dosed with gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin prepared with hp67.6 antibody produced from either the initial or commercial cell lines. 
 plasma protein binding of n-ac-
 γ-calicheamicin dmh was high in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma (≥ 97%). in rats, distribution of [3h]gemtuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents into red blood 
 cells and tissues was limited, with tissue-to-plasma auc ratios ≤ 0.54 for all tissues evaluated. the 
 highest tissue-to-plasma ratios were observed in the blood (0.54), liver (0.36), kidney (0.26), spleen 
 (0.25), and lung (0.22). radioequivalents in brain were &lt; 2% of plasma. 
 in vivo metabolism of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was not evaluated in nonclinical species; however, in vivo metabolism was evaluated in rats after iv administration of [3h]inotuzumab ozogamicin, which shares the same linker-payload and mab igg subclass as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and, like gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin, does not bind to its target antigen in nonclinical species. in rats, [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin 
 dmh was extensively metabolized following release from [3h]inotuzumab ozogamicin. the primary 
 metabolic pathway for [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh in rats was reduction of the disulphide moiety, 
 leading to formation of n-ac-
 ε-calicheamicin and deglycosylated tetrasaccharide metabolites. hydrolysis (of the hydrazide moiety), oxidation, and adduction (with pyruvic acid) were minor metabolic pathways.</p><p>
 inotuzumab ozogamicin accounted for 66% of total drug-related material (auc) in circulation of rats, with 
 2 unidentified, higher molecular weight (mw) species accounting for the remainder of circulating 
 radioactivity. 
 in vivo metabolism of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in humans was assessed by analysis of urine samples collected from patients administered unlabeled gemtuzumab ozogamicin. all urinary 
 metabolites detected in patient samples were also observed in rats administered [3h]inotuzumab 
 ozogamicin.</p><p>
 the effect of ph on the hydrolytic stability of the hydrazone linker of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 
 evaluated in buffer at various ph. gemtuzumab ozogamicin was stable to hydrolytic cleavage at ph 7.4, 
 but at ph 4.5, approximately 50% of the total n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh was hydrolytically cleaved from 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin in 6 hours.</p><p>
 minimal deconjugation of calicheamicin (&lt;10%) occurred following incubation of gemtuzumab

 those found in plasma but was readily reduced at intracellular concentrations. the contribution of glutathione-s-transferase (gst) was negligible compared to the effect of gsh alone.</p><p>
 following incubation of [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh in liver s9 (supplemented with a full complement 
 of cofactors including glutathione) and plasma, metabolic profiles were similar across species as 
 [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh underwent metabolism primarily by reduction. in addition, incubation of 
 [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh in buffer controls were similar to those including liver s9 or plasma, 
 suggesting that a majority of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh biotransformation occurs non-enzymatically. 
 metabolic profiles of [3h]n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh observed in vitro were qualitatively similar to those 
 observed in in vivo samples collected from rats dosed with [3h]inotuzumab ozogamicin. collectively, 
 these data indicate that the hydrolytic release of n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh from gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin or inotuzumab ozogamicin in circulation is limited and the metabolism of 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh occurs primarily via non-enzymatic reduction. therefore, coadministration of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cyp or ugt drug metabolizing enzymes are 
 unlikely to alter exposure to n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh. 
 after iv administration of [3h]gemtuzumab ozogamicin to rats, the majority of the radioactive dose was 
 recovered in the faeces (59%), with urinary excretion as a minor route of elimination (13%). 
 radioactivity was eliminated slowly over time and was still being excreted in the faeces and urine of rats 
 at the end of the study (14 days), accounting for the incomplete mass balance observed.</p><p>
 assessment of drug-drug interaction (ddi) potential with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh for reversible or time-dependent cyp inhibition was based on the 50% 
 inhibitory concentration (ic50) and/or inactivation kinetics determined from 
 in vitro studies and the mean steady-state total cmax of 3280 ng/ml (0.0221 μm) for hp67.6 antibody and 5.81 ng/ml (0.00393 μm) 
 for unconjugated calicheamicin achieved in humans after multiple dose administration of 9 mg/m
 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin.</p><p> gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not cause induction of cyp3a4 in the transfected hepg2 cells at up to 
 0.0424 μm of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (highest concentration evaluated). in humans, the mean 
 steady-state total hp67.6 antibody cmax after multiple dose administration of 9 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin was 3280 ng/ml (0.0221 μm). gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not induce cyp3a4 at 
 concentrations up to 0.0424 μm, which was approximately 2x the cmax. n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh did 
 not cause induction of cyp1a2, cyp2b6, or cyp3a4 mrna expression and/or enzyme activity in any of the 
 3 hepatocyte lots evaluated to 0.3 μm. this was &gt;50x the cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin. finally, 
 n-ac-
 ϵ-calicheamicin did not cause induction of cyp3a4 in the transfected hepg2 cells at up to 0.120 μm, which was &gt;50x the cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin. 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh demonstrated little or no reversible inhibition of ugt1a4, ugt1a6, ugt1a9, 
 and ugt2b7 catalysed activities; however, n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh inhibited ugt1a1 activity. 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh showed little or no inhibition of the bidirectional transport of digoxin (p-gp 
 substrate) or pitavastatin (bcrp substrate). the efflux ratio of digoxin in the absence and presence of 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh (0.3 μm) was 39.1 and 48.2, respectively. n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh inhibited 
 the oatp1b1- and oatp1b3-mediated transport of pravastatin and rosuvastatin by 30% and 16%, 
 respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh, over the concentrations 
 evaluated, did not inhibit oat1, oat3, or oct2. the ic50 for inhibition was estimated to be &gt;0.5 μm (ki 
 &gt;0.25 μm) for oat1 and &gt;0.1 μm (ki &gt;0.05 μm) for oat3 and oct2.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 reversibility of any effects after a 4-week non-dosing period was assessed in sprague-dawley rats. 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered iv (bolus) to male and female rats (15/sex/group for the 
 toxicity animals; 12/sex/group for the toxicokinetic animals) at doses of 0 (pbs control), 7.2 (hp67.6 
 antibody control), 0.6, 2.4, or 7.2 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>there was no mortality and no ocular findings during the study. gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs of toxicity occurred at ≥0.6 mg/m
 2/week and included a dose-related increased incidence and frequency of few or no faeces and a wet/stained perianal 
 area at 7.2 mg/m
 2/week. gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused slightly lower mean body weight at ≥2.4 mg/m
 2/week in males (22% to 34%) and at 7.2 mg/m2/week in females (19%). gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related haematologic effects occurred on red blood cell (rbc) mass (rbc, haemoglobin, and 
 haematocrit), and wbc counts. there were no clinical pathology changes observed after administration of 
 hp67.6 antibody alone. the primary gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic findings were observed 
 in the, kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow, testes/epididymides, and male mammary gland. slight to 
 marked tubular dilation, casts, and basophilia were observed in the kidney of males and females at 
 ≥ 2.4 mg/m
 2/week. the microscopic findings in the kidney correlated with pale kidneys observed in males macroscopically at 7.2 mg/m
 2/week, slight increases in kidney weight (12% to 25%) at ≥ 2.4 mg/m
 2/week, and proteinuria and decreased serum albumin. vacuolation (minimal to slight, males only), hepatocellular karyocytomegaly (minimal to marked), atrophy of hepatocytes and dilation of sinusoids 
 (minimal to moderate), oval cell/bile duct proliferation (minimal to slight), and haematopoiesis (minimal) 
 were observed in the liver of both sexes at 7.2 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>after a 4-week non-dosing period, overall body weight gain (days 41 to 69) was comparable in animals 
 given gemtuzumab ozogamicin and control animals. clinical pathology values in animals administered 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin were similar to control animals at the end of the 4-week non-dosing period 
 except for wbc, alt, and globulin, and proteinuria. on day 65, mean wbc count was still lower in males 
 at ≥0.6 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>the alt values in males were still moderately higher, and globulin was slightly higher in females at 7.2 mg/m
 2/week. proteinuria was still present (2+ to 4+) at ≥0.6 mg/m2/week on day 66. gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic changes were observed in kidney, liver, testes, 
 and male mammary gland at the end of the 4-week non-dosing period. there were no organ weight, 
 macroscopic, or microscopic changes related to administration of the hp67.6 antibody alone at the end of 
 the dosing or recovery phases of study. 
 the noael was considered to be 0.6 mg/m
 2/week based on adverse effects on male reproductive organs, kidney, liver, bone marrow, and spleen at 
 ≥ 2.4 mg/m2/week. the mean cmax exposure value for total hp67.6 antibody after the first dose was 1840 ng/ml and the mean auc168 exposure value for total 
 hp67.6 antibody after the first dose was 90,600 ng•h/ml at 0.6 mg/m
 2/week. • 6-week toxicity study in monkeys (study miracl-26812) this study assessed the potential toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and associated systemic exposure and ada response following 6 weeks of once-weekly dosing in cynomolgus monkeys and the reversibility 
 of any effects after a 4-week non-dosing period. gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered iv (bolus) to 
 male and female monkeys (5/sex/group) at doses of 0 (pbs control), 22 (hp67.6 antibody control), 2.4, 
 7.2, or 22 mg/m2/week. 
 there were no unscheduled deaths or hp67.6 antibody- or gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs, 
 ecg, or ophthalmoscopic observations noted during the study. slightly lower body weight (3% to 19%;</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 day 41) was observed at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week; however, there were no changes in qualitative food consumption. gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related haematologic effects occurred on days 9 and 37 at ≥.2 
 mg/m
 2/week and consisted of slightly to moderately lower rbc mass (11% to 42%), wbcs (5% to 68%), polymorphonuclear cells (33% to 78%), and lymphocytes (41% to 63%). gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin-related clinical chemistry effects occurred at 2.4 mg/m2/week on days 9 and/or 37 and 
 consisted of higher ast, total protein, globulin, and sodium, and lower albumin and albumin/globulin ratio 
 (a/g). gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic findings were noted in the kidney, liver, thymus, 
 spleen, lymphatic tissues, and bone marrow. minimal to moderate dilation, basophilia, casts, vacuolation 
 of glomerular tufts, and/or accumulation of red granules were observed in the kidney at ≥7.2 
 mg/m
 2/week. slight to marked dilation of liver sinusoids with hepatocyte atrophy and minimal to slight amounts of brown pigment (hemosiderin) was observed in the liver at ≥7.2 mg/m
 2/week. minimal to moderate hepatocellular single cell necrosis was observed at 22 mg/m
 2/week. microscopic changes in the liver correlated with macroscopic findings of red foci/discoloured at ≥2.4 mg/m2/week. changes in the 
 lymphohaematopoietic system included slight to marked depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus; atrophy 
 of germinal centers and depletion of lymphocytes in the spleen, cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, and 
 tonsils; and/or hypocellularity of the bone marrow at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week.</p><p>
 most gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical pathology changes were fully reversible by the end of the 
 4-week non-dosing period. rbc and lymphocyte counts were still lower at ≥7.2 mg/m
 2/week or 22 mg/m
 2/week, respectively, but less than that observed at the end of the dosing period. changes in the kidney and liver were partially to fully reversible after the non-dosing period. changes observed in the 
 lymphohaematopoietic system were not reversible. slight to marked depletion of lymphocytes was 
 observed in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, and slight to marked atrophy of germinal centers was 
 observed in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and tonsils at ≥7.2 mg/m
 2/week. the noael was considered to be 2.4 mg/m
 2/week based on target organ toxicity in the kidney, liver, and lymphohaematopoietic organs at ≥7.2 mg/m
 2/week. mean cmax and auc168 exposure values (males and females combined) for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (as measured by total hp67.6 antibody) at week 1 
 (data for week 6 was not collected) were 3500 ng/ml and 258,000 ng
 • h/ml, respectively. • 6-week toxicity and comparability study in monkeys (study gtr-27677) the purpose of this study was to evaluate the comparability, toxicity, and associated systemic exposure and ada response of gemtuzumab ozogamicin manufactured with hp67.6 antibody produced from the 
 initial and commercial cell lines following 6 weeks of once-weekly dosing in cynomolgus monkeys. 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin manufactured with antibody produced from the commercial cell line was 
 administered iv (bolus) to male monkeys (3/group) at doses of 0 (saline control), 18 (hp67.6 antibody 
 control), 2.4, 6, or 18 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>there were no unscheduled deaths and no gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related ophthalmologic findings. gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs were limited 
 to a rash in 2 monkeys (7.2 mg/m
 2/week [initial cell line] and at 18 mg/m2/week).</p><p>mild decreases in rbc mass (rbc, haemoglobin, haematocrit) were observed at 18 mg/m
 2/week. decreases in wbcs and lymphocytes, and increases in neutrophils were also observed at 18 mg/m
 2/week. clinical pathology values were of similar magnitude for monkeys given 7.2 mg/m
 2/week (initial cell line) or 6 mg/m
 2/week, suggesting a similar biological effect of these two cell lines.</p><p>gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related findings were noted in haematolymphopoietic tissues (lymph nodes, 
 tonsils, thymus, and spleen), testes and epididymides, bone marrow, kidney, and liver. microscopic 
 findings in the kidney and liver were similar to those reported in a previous 6-week study in monkeys with 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin (miracl-26812).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 when compared with monkeys given gemtuzumab ozogamicin at 7.2 mg/m2/week (initial cell line) in this study, changes in monkeys given 7.2 mg/m
 2/week (initial cell line) in the previous 6-week study (miracl-26812) included slightly more severe and widespread lymphoid depletion/atrophy. additionally, 
 liver cell atrophy and renal tubular alterations were also noted in the previous study. in contrast, bone 
 marrow hypocellularity was slightly more prevalent in monkeys in the current study. the testicular and 
 epididymal degenerative changes observed at 18 mg/m
 2/week in the current study were not reported in the previous study with the initial cell line.</p><p>
 • 12-week toxicity study in monkeys (study 16gr242) a glp-compliant general toxicity study in monkeys was also completed in which 12 doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were given once weekly by intravenous bolus injection to groups of 3 male and 3 female 
 cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0 (sterile water), 2.2, 6.6, or 11 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>it was formulated at 0.98 mg/ml.</p><p> 
 doses of ≥11 mg/m
 2/weekk caused severe toxicity and monkeys were euthanized early, despite initiation of a dose-free period.</p><p>all monkeys in the higher two dose groups were euthanize early for this reason, 
 between days 33 and 53 (between 4 and 8 doses).</p><p>monkeys showed body weight loss with clinical decline 
 attributed to primarily to drug-induced liver toxicity with evidence of decreased red cell mass due, at least 
 in part, to test article-related bone marrow injury.</p><p>in addition, at ≥2.2 mg/m
 2/week, there was body weight loss, decreases in red cell mass and microscopic findings in liver, bone marrow, lymphoid organs, 
 kidney, male and female reproductive organs, and/or eyes which meant that in this study, a no 
 observable adverse effect level (noael) was not identified.</p><p>monkeys administered</p><p>2.2 mg/m2/kg were 
 euthanized after 12 doses, 1 week earlier than initially intended.</p><p>monkeys in all doses groups, including 
 the lowest, showed body weight loss with a reduction in food intake.</p><p>there were multiple abnormalities 
 in clinical chemistry testing.</p><p>these included increases in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 
 (ast), gamma glutamyltransferase and total bilirubin with decreased albumin and a:g ratio.</p><p>on 
 microscopic examinations, the livers showed sinusoidal dilatation and/or hepatocyte atrophy in monkeys 
 given 6.6 or 11 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>at post-mortem, organ weight data were only collected from monkeys given 2.2 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>there were findings of lower weight of testes and epididymes, correlated with microscopic findings of degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the testis and increased luminal 
 debris, epithelial degeneration, and oligospermia.</p><p>liver weights were lower in males.</p><p>thymus weights in 
 females given 2.2 mg/m
 2/weekwere reduced (non-significantly so) but thymuses showed decreased lymphocytes.</p><p>there were also increases in the weight of kidneys and spleen.</p><p>there were changes seen 
 on microscopic examination in liver, bone marrow (sternum), kidney, lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen, 
 and mesenteric lymph node), eyes, testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, ovary, oviduct, uterus and cervix.</p><p>
 immunostaining for vegfr2 in controls resulted in staining of the endothelial cells uniformly throughout 
 the liver; in monkeys given gemtuzumab ozogamicin, there was minimally to moderately decreased 
 staining consistent with alteration and/or loss of sinusoidal endothelial cells in affected regions.</p><p>in the 
 bone marrow of the sternum, there was an increase in myeloid / erythroid ratio (resulting from decreased 
 population of erythroid precursors), considered adverse at ≥6.6 mg/m
 2/week and which were associated with decreases in red blood cell mass.</p><p>in the kidneys, again at ≥ 6.6 mg/m
 2/week, there were changes of minimal to moderate tubular epithelium degeneration / regeneration, minimal or slight 
 karyocytomegaly of tubular epithelium, minimal to slight glomerulopathy and moderate pigment in 
 tubular epithelial cells.</p><p>lymphoid organ findings were observed at ≥2.2 mg/m
 2/weekand consisted of decreased lymphocyte cellularity in splenic follicles, in the thymus (cortex and medulla), and in the 
 mesenteric lymph node (characterized by decreased follicle size or absence of follicles).</p><p>the male 
 reproductive tract was adversely affected, consistent with the organ weight changes described above and 
 in the reproductive tract of females, there were also adverse changes of ovarian atrophy and disruption 
 or loss of a normal menstrual cycle would be expected.</p><p>there were a multitude of other changes noted</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 36/138</p><p> 
 that were attributed to secondary consequences of the primary effects just described.</p><p>there was a finding of myocardial degeneration / necrosis in a male at 2.2 mg/m
 2/week, but its acute nature suggested to the applicant that it had occurred near the time of euthanasia and was not due to 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin.</p><p> 
 therefore, in this study, a noael was not identified; the lowest observable adverse effect level (loael) 
 for the study was 2.2 mg/m
 2/week.</p><p>mean overall exposure values (male and female combined) at the loael for total antibody (hp67.6) were 7,420 ng/ml and 541,000 ng•h/ml for c
 max and auc168, respectively, at week 1 and 13,900 ng/ml and 1,470,000 ng•h/ml for c
 max and auc168, respectively, at week 6 (exposures at week 12 were similar to week 6). 
 • 13-day tolerability study in rabbits (study gtr-33261) the purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin after 13 days of once-daily dosing in female new zealand white rabbits followed by a 15-day non-dosing period. 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered iv (bolus) via a marginal ear vein to female rabbits (4/group) 
 at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 1.2, 3.6, or 7.2 mg/m
 2/day. all animals survived the dosing period; however, 2 animals given 7.2 mg/m
 2/day were electively euthanized</p><p>during the post-dose period (days 16 or 23) as a result of adverse clinical observations (lacrimation, white discharge around eyes, lethargy, 
 ptosis, lack of food consumption in 1 animal, and body weight loss for both animals [15% to 25%]). 
 cultures of samples from the eyes and paranasal sinus were negative for pathogenic bacteria, and the 
 cause of ocular discharge could not be determined. the remaining observations were attributed to 
 administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. dose-related mean decreases in food consumption and body 
 weight occurred in all groups administered gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and these effects occurred generally 
 during and after the second week of dosing. in the 1.2 mg/m
 2/day group, 1 of 4 females was affected, whereas all animals were affected in the 3.6 and 7.2 mg/m2/day groups. during the second week of 
 dosing at 
 ≥ 1.2 mg/m2/day, mean body weight loss ranged from 112 to 263 grams, and mean food consumption decreased from 33% to 57% during the same period. body weights continued to decrease 
 during the non-dosing period (days 14 to 28) at 7.2 mg/m
 2/day, but partial recovery from body weight losses occurred at 
 ≤ 3.6 mg/m2/day. macroscopic findings at 7.2 mg/m2/day in animals at the scheduled necropsy included discoloration of the anterior lobes of the lung (bilateral) in 1 animal, and multifocal tan 
 discoloration of the liver in another animal. 
 the mtd was considered to be 1.2 mg/m
 2/day based on the absence of gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related changes in 3 of 4 animals in this group, mortality at 7.2 mg/m
 2/day, and dose-related decreases in body weight and food consumption at 
 ≥3.6 mg/m2/day.</p></section><section><header>genotoxicity</header><p>gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated for potential genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus study. in addition,

 f. doses of pf-05208747 are expressed as dose equivalents of the hp67.6 antibody on the basis of mg/m2 of body surface area. in the

 doses were converted to mg/m2 using a conversion factor of 6 for rat. 
 g. an additional 12 females/group at doses of 0.15, 0.45, or 1.2 mg/m2 were included as satellite animals for determination of 
 toxicokinetic parameters and antibody response. 
 h. an additional 3 (timed-mated) or 5 (non-gravid) females/group were dosed daily for 3 days by iv injection without dextran-40 or with 
 the same and lesser amounts of dextran-40, respectively, to determine if the swelling observed in all groups in the developmental 
 toxicity dose-ranging aspect of the study were attributable to the presence of dextran-40 in the dosing formulations. in these groups, 
 tissue swelling did not occur in the rats given formulation diluent without dextran-40 or with lesser amounts (
 0 .1 4 % ) of d e xtra n-40, while similar tissue swelling occurred in the rats given dextran-40 (0.91%) in phosphate buffered saline. these results indicated that the 
 tissue swelling in rats observed in the developmental toxicity dose-ranging aspect of the study was due to the dextran-40 component 
 of the vehicle.</p><p>
 in the 6 week toxicity study with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (miracl-26813) effects on male reproductive organs (testes, epididymides, and mammary gland) were observed at ≥ 2.4 mg/m
 2/week (approximately 3.7 or 18 times the human clinical exposure after the second human dose of 9 mg/m
 2, or after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2, respectively, based on auc). effects on male rat reproductive organs were 
 partially reversible or not reversible following a 4-week non-dosing period. these findings did not resolve 
 following a 9-week recovery period. gemtuzumab ozogamicin adversely affected male fertility in rats 
 (rpt-40369), effects included lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes, decreases in testicular 
 spermatids and epididymal sperm, vacuolation of the nucleus in spermatids, and/or appearance of giant 
 cells at ≥ 0.12 mg/m
 2/day. additional findings included effects on the testes and epididymides; both organs were macroscopically small and decreased in weight as well as fertility (1.08 mg/m
 2/day). when male rats were mated again after a 9-week non-dosing period, effects on sperm and fertility were worse 
 but there was partial recovery of the lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testes.</p><p>
 the potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to have effects on fertility and early embryonic development 
 was evaluated in female sprague-dawley rats (rpt-40230). female rats (32/group) were administered 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin iv once daily at doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.12, 0.36, or 1.08 mg/m2/day for 14 
 days. there were no gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related effects on copulation and fertility index in any 
 females that mated at the end of the dosing or non-dosing periods; however, in females at the end of the 
 dosing period there was a decrease in corpora lutea at 1.08 mg/m
 2/day indicating an effect on ovulation. this decrease in corpora lutea resulted in lower numbers of implants at 1.08 mg/m
 2/day. at the end of the dosing phase, the average number of live embryos per litter was 14.33, 13.07, 11.86, and 7.13, and the 
 dead embryo indices were 6.52%, 7.98%, 15.74%, and 47.95% at 0 (vehicle control), 0.12, 0.36, or 1.08 
 mg/m
 2/day, respectively; this increase in embryo lethality at 0.36 and 1.08 mg/m2/day was considered gemtuzumab ozogamicin related. the lower numbers of corpora lutea resulted in lower numbers of 
 implants in the 1.08 mg/m
 2/day group at the end of the dosing phase. in dams that mated at the end of the non-dosing period, no effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were observed in the numbers of corpora 
 lutea, implants, or embryos. the noael for general and female reproductive toxicity was 0.12 
 mg/m
 2/day based on effects on maternal body weight, maternal food consumption, female fertility (lower numbers of corpora lutea), and early embryonic development (embryo lethality) at ≥0.36 mg/m
 2/day in females that were mated immediately after the gemtuzumab ozogamicin-dosing phase. no gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin-related effects on early embryonic development were observed in dams that mated at the 
 end of the 6-week non-dosing period. 
 dose-dependent reductions in maternal food consumption, body weight gain, uterine weights and fetal 
 body weight was observed after daily dosing with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (0.06; 0.15 and 0.36 
 mg/m
 2/day) to pregnant rats (gtr-33829). the highest dose (approximately 0.04 times the recommended human single dose on a mg/m
 2 basis) produced increased embryo-foetal mortality, and</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 indicating that conjugation of the linker-payload to the hp67.6 antibody does not alter its binding affinity 
 to the cells. binding and internalization analysis of radioiodinated hp67.6 antibody demonstrated efficient 
 delivery of the cytotoxic payload of the product into cd33-expressing hl-60 cells and payload release was 
 determined at a ph value of 4.5, which is consistent with the ph in the acidic lysosomal vesicular 
 compartment of the cell.</p><p>
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin exhibited 
 in vitro cytotoxicity in cd33+ cells, and inhibition of colony growth in blood or bone marrow specimens from aml patients, but not in normal samples.</p><p>
 in hl60 aml subcutaneous xenografts in immune-compromised mice, gemtuzumab ozogamicin reduced 
 tumour growth and enhanced survival at doses of 1 mg/kg/day on a q4dx4 schedule. 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin safety pharmacology was evaluated in mice, rats, and dogs after a single iv 
 administration. in an 
 in vitro herg current inhibition study with n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh, no significant herg current inhibition was observed up to 6.77 µm.</p><p>
 nonclinical studies assessing drug-drug interaction potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and/or 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh were presented and indicated a low potential to inhibit activities of cyp1a2, 
 cyp2a6, cyp2b6, cyp2c8, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, or cyp3a4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh demonstrated little or no reversible inhibition of ugt1a4, ugt1a6, ugt1a9, 
 and ugt2b7 catalysed activities; however, n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh inhibited ugt1a1 activity. 
 n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh showed little or no inhibition of the bidirectional transport of digoxin (p-gp 
 substrate) or pitavastatin (bcrp substrate).n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh inhibited the oatp1b1- and 
 oatp1b3-mediated transport of pravastatin and rosuvastatin by 30% and 16%, respectively, in a 
 concentration-dependent manner. a low potential for an interaction between n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh 
 and these two transporters at clinically relevant concentrations exists. n-ac-γ-calicheamicin dmh, over 
 the concentrations evaluated, did not inhibit oat1, oat3, or oct2.</p><p>
 overall, n ac γ-calicheamicin dmh showed a low potential to inhibit p gp, bcrp, bsep, mrp2, mate1, 
 mate2k, oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oct1, oat1, oat3, and oct2 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
 the main toxicities occurred in the liver, bone marrow and lymphoid organs, haematology parameters 
 (decreased rbc mass and wbc counts, mainly lymphocytes), kidney, eye and male and female 
 reproductive organs. effects on liver, kidney and male reproductive organs in rats, and on lymphoid 
 tissues in monkeys (approximately 18 times for rats, and 36 times for monkeys, the human clinical</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on auc168) were not reversible. effects on female reproductive organs and the eye in monkeys were adverse in the 12-week study (approximately 193 and 
 322 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m
 2 based on auc
 168). the relevance of the irreversible animal findings to humans is uncertain (smpc, section 5.3). clinical chemistry changes in rats and monkeys included dose-related changes in ast, alt, and/or alp 
 after single and/or repeat dosing with go. mylotarg has the potential to cause elevations in liver-related 
 laboratory tests and hepatotoxicity. severe (grade 
 ≥ 3) and/or serious hepatotoxicity including all vod/sos has been classified as an identified risk in the risk management plan (see discussion on clinical 
 safety). 
 in rats and monkeys, haematology changes consisted of decreases in rbc mass, wbc counts (mainly 
 lymphocytes), and platelets (rats only at high doses associated with hepatocellular necrosis) in single 
 and/or repeat-dose studies up to 6 weeks in duration with go. myelosuppression (severe and/or serious 
 infection and haemorrhage has been classified as an identified risk in the risk management plan (see 
 discussion on clinical safety). 
 nervous system effects have not been observed in rats or monkeys after single or repeat dosing with go. 
 nervous system alterations were identified after repeat doses in rats with other antibody-calicheamicin 
 conjugates and are considered to be a class effect (smpc, section 5.3). neurotoxicity has been classified 
 as a potential risk in the risk management plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
 renal tubular degeneration associated with tubular casts, dilation, karyocytomegaly, and basophilia, 
 accompanied by proteinuria and decreased serum albumin was observed in rats after in single- or 
 repeat-dose studies up to 6 weeks in duration with go. renal toxicity has been classified as a potential 
 risk in the risk management plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was found to be clastogenic. this is consistent with the known induction of dna 
 breaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics. n acetyl gamma calicheamicin dmh 
 (the released cytotoxin) was found to be mutagenic and clastogenic (smpc, section 5.3). second primary 
 malignancy has been classified as a potential risk in the risk management plan. 
 formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. in toxicity 
 studies, rats developed preneoplastic lesions (minimal to slight oval cell hyperplasia) in the liver 
 approximately 54 times, the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m
 2 based on auc
 168). there were no preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed in monkeys up to approximately 115 times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m
 2 based on auc168). the relevance of these animal findings to humans is uncertain (smpc, section 5.3). 
 in a female rat fertility study slightly lower numbers of corpora lutea and increased embryolethality were 
 observed in the presence of maternal toxicity (approximately 9.7 times, the human clinical exposure after 
 the third human dose of 3 mg/m
 2 based on auc168). effects on the reproductive tract of female monkeys were observed in the 12-week study (atrophy of the ovary, oviduct, uterus, and cervix; approximately 
 193 times the human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m
 2) (smpc, section 5.3).</p><p>in a male fertility study, effects on male reproduction included lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes, 
 decreases in testicular spermatids and epididymal sperm, vacuolation of the nucleus in spermatids, 
 and/or appearance of giant cells. additional findings included effects on the testes, epididymides and 
 mammary gland as well as fertility. when male rats were mated again after a 9 week non-dosing period, 
 effects on sperm and fertility were worse but there was partial recovery of the lower spermatogonia and 
 spermatocytes in the testes. effects on male rat reproductive organs were partially reversible or not 
 reversible. male reproductive effects (testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles) in monkeys were observed</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 page 51/138</p><p> 
 at approximately 66 times the human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m2) (smpc, section 5.3). 
 in an embryo-foetal toxicity study lower foetal body weight, higher incidence of foetal wavy ribs, and 
 lower incidence of foetal skeletal ossification were observed. increased embryolethality and foetal 
 morphological anomalies included digital malformations, absence of the aortic arch, anomalies in the long 
 bones in the forelimbs, misshapen scapula, absence of a vertebral centrum, and fused sternebrae. 
 increased embryolethality was also observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. the lowest dose with 
 embryo-foetal effects correlated with 9.7 times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 
 3 mg/m
 2, based on auc168 (smpc, section 5.3). a tissue cross-reactivity study using rat or cynomolgus monkey cryosections determined that specific 
 staining by hp67.6 was absent in all tissues of both animal species. in view of the absence of 
 cross-reactivity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with cd33 from laboratory species, studies of kinetics in 
 animals can only be of limited value, as there will be no binding, specific intracellular uptake, and 
 metabolism of the conjugate that underlies its therapeutic action in humans. further pk data were 
 derived from the 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p>the mechanism proposed for liver 
 toxicity is suggested to be related to tissue vascularisation and hence exposure to the product ie the liver, 
 as a highly perfused organ, is exposed to more gemtuzumab ozogamicin than poorly vascularised tissues.</p><p>
 toxicity is suspected to arise from uptake by liver sinusoidal cells and breakdown of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin leading to local cellular toxicity where this occurs. therefore this does not correlate with tissue 
 binding results. 
 the phototoxic potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is low, based on the type of product and a low 
 distribution to eye and skin in rats. 
 the introduction of mylotarg would not be expected to result in an environmental risk based on the data 
 generated. however, this conclusion is based on an estimated value for log kow; the applicant is

 disulphide moiety. the activity (cytotoxicity) of the resultant metabolites is expected to be significantly 
 attenuated. in patients, unconjugated calicheamicin plasma levels were typically low, with a predicted 
 mean cmax of 1.5 ng/ml following the third dose (smpc, section 5.2). 
 based on population pk analyses, the predicted clearance (cl) value of hp67.6 from plasma was 3 l/h 
 immediately after the first dose and then 0.3 l/h. the terminal plasma half-life (t½) for hp67.6 was

 the adult population pk analysis required incorporation of a fixed effect of bwt (allometric scaling) on v1

 was included for cl/f and v1/f.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 for the paediatric population modelling, bwt was incorporated as a fixed effect on hp67.6 cl1, central volume of distribution (v1), and decay coefficient of the time-dependent clearance (kdes) using the 
 theoretical allometric values of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume, respectively, and estimating the 
 effect of body weight on kdes. 
 renal impairment the clearance of hp67.6 in patients with mild renal impairment (n=149) and with moderate renal impairment (n=47) was similar to the clearance of hp67.6 in patients with normal renal function 
 (n=209). severe renal impairment could not be assessed due to lack of information (n=1). for 
 unconjugated calicheamicin, the same measure of renal impairment was tested as a covariate in the 
 population model and was not found to significantly affect the pk. 
 the median estimated total cl values were 0.113, 0.112, 0.0889, and 0.0670 l/hour for patients in the 
 normal (a), mild (b1), mild (b2), and moderate (c) groups, respectively; there were no patients in the

 hepatic impairment the results showed the clearance of hp67.6 in patients with mild hepatic impairment (b1, n=58), mild hepatic impairment (b2, n=19), or moderate hepatic impairment (c, n=6) was similar to that in patients 
 with normal hepatic function (a, n=322). in the 6 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (c), the 
 median hp67.6 clearance appeared to be lower; however, the mean hp67.6 clearance was not lower. for 
 unconjugated calicheamicin, the same measures of hepatic impairment were tested as covariates in the 
 population model and none were found to significantly affect the pk. 
 gender the volume of distribution in the central compartment (v1) was decreased by 16.2% in females patients. gender was not a significant covariate for the pk parameters of unconjugated calicheamicin. the 
 exposure-response model showed that gender did not significantly affect the efficacy or safety outcomes 
 examined. 
 race the adult population modelling showed that race did not significantly affect the pk of hp67.6 or unconjugated calicheamicin. population pk modelling showed that race, in particular asian vs non-asian 
 (white 89%, black 2%, other 2%, asian 7%), was not a significant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of

 in vitro, n acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to induce the activities of cyp3a4 at clinically relevant concentrations with ic50 values of 5.5, 
 0.42, and 0.40 µm for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, midazolam 1 γ -hydroxylation, and nifedipine

 n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh showed time-dependent inhibitory activity of cyp2c8 and cyp3a4/5 activity 
 (as measured by testosterone 6β-hydroxylation and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation). n-ac- γ -calicheamicin 
 dmh showed very weak time-dependent inhibition of cyp2c8, with the concentration at half the maximal 
 rate of enzyme inactivation (ki) of &gt;30

 μm), indicates the potential for n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh to inhibit cyp3a4/5 in a time-dependent manner at 
 clinically relevant concentrations (r2 values of 1.22-1.56). however, assessment of ddi potential using 
 the mean steady-state unbound cmax for unconjugated calichemaicin, 0.000110 
 μm, indicated a low potential for n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh to inhibit cyp3a4/5 in a time-dependent manner at clinically 
 relevant concentrations (r values of 1.01-1.02). moreover, mechanistic static modeling of the effect of 
 n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh on the cyp3a4/5 substrate midazolam indicated a low potential for n-ac- γ 
 -calicheamicin dmh to inhibit cyp3a4/5 in a time-dependent manner at clinically relevant concentrations, 
 with an estimated midazolam aucr value of 1.02. 
 potential induction of cyp enzymes gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not induce cyp1a2, cyp2b6, and cyp3a4 in 3 lots of cryopreserved human hepatocytes at concentrations .50x the cmaxof total hp67.6 antibody in patients after multiple dose 
 administration of 3 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin (0.00426 μm). these results indicate that the 
 potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to induce cyp1a2, cyp2b6, or cyp3a4 is low at clinically relevant 
 concentrations. 
 n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh did not cause induction of cyp3a4 in the transfected hepg2 cells up to 0.090 
 µm (highest concentration evaluated). n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh had a low potential to inhibit the</p><p>

 the mean steady-state unbound cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin multiple dose administration of 9 
 mg/m
 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 0.000110 µm. potential inhibition of ugt enzymes in the presence or absence of 2% bovine serum albumin (bsa), n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh showed little or no reversible inhibition of ugt1a4, ugt1a6, ugt1a9, and ugt2b7 catalyzed activities (ic50 &gt;10 μm). 
 however, n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh inhibited ugt1a1 activity with ic50 values of 0.61 and 1.4 μm, in 
 the absence or presence of 2% bsa, respectively. the unbound ic50 value could not be determined due

 associated protein (mrp) 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (mate)1 and mate2k, organic anion 
 transporter (oat)1 and oat3, organic cation transporter (oct)1 and oct2, and organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide (oatp)1b1 and oatp1b3 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
 efflux transporters the potential interaction of n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh (over a concentration range of 0.002 to 0.3 μm) with efflux transporters p-gp and bcrp was investigated in vitro in mdckii-mdr1 cells and mdckii low 
 efflux cells expressing the bcrp transporter (mdckii-le-bcrp) using the prototypical substrates digoxin 
 (10 μm) and pitavastatin (0.5 μm) for the respective efflux transporters. 
 results indicate a low potential for an interaction between n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh and p-gp and bcrp 
 at clinically relevant concentrations (mean steady-state total and unbound cmax values of unconjugated 
 calicheamicin of 0.00393 μm and 0.000110 μm, respectively. the ratio of total cmax/ki was &lt;0.1, and 
 50x the unbound cmax did not exceed the estimated ki value of &gt;0.15 μm. 
 hepatic uptake transporters n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh, at a concentration range of 0.00005 to 0.1 μm, was evaluated for its potential to inhibit the human hepatic uptake transporters oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 expressed in human 
 embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells using pravastatin (10 μm) and rosuvastatin (5 μm), respectively, as the 
 prototypical probe substrates. 
 n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh inhibited the oatp1b1- and oatp1b3-mediated transport of pravastatin and 
 rosuvastatin, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. inhibition of oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 at 
 the highest concentration of n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh evaluated (0.1 μm) was 30% and 16%, 
 respectively, while rifamycin sv (100 μm, positive control inhibitor) inhibited the transport of pravastatin 
 and rosuvastatin by 98% and 57%, respectively. the ic50 of n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh-mediated 
 inhibition of oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 was estimated to be &gt;0.1 μm, and the ki was estimated to be &gt;0.05

 was &lt;0.1, and 50x the unbound cmax did not exceed the estimated ki value of &gt;0.05 μm. 
 renal uptake transporters the inhibitory potency of n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh for the human renal transporters, oat1, oat3, and oct2, was assessed using hek293 cells over-expressing each transporter with [3h]p-aminohippurate (2

 oat1 and at a concentration range of 0.0004 to 0.1 μm for oat3 and oct2. 
 n-ac- γ -calicheamicin dmh, over the concentrations evaluated, did not inhibit oat1, oat3, or oct2,

 the results of the population modelling showed that the pk behaviour of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
 (hp67.6 antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is similar between adult and paediatric aml patients 
 following the 9 mg/m
 2 dosing regimen (smpc section 5.2).</p><p>the safety and efficacy of mylotarg in patients less than 15 years of age has not been established. no 
 recommendation on a posology can be made (smpc section 4.2).</p><p>
 pharmacokinetic data using the proposed posology supporting the use in adult patients is solely based on 
 pk modelling. the population pk model for gemtuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated calicheamicin in 
 adult aml patients showed that allometric exponentials are appropriate and therefore a bsa-based 
 dosing approach is justified. in addition, a population pk model for paediatric aml subjects (down to 2 
 years old of age) showed that no factors other than body weight appeared to significantly impact the pk 
 of total antibody or unconjugated calicheamicin. allomeric scaling on cl and volume of distribution 
 accounted for the wide range of age and body size in the in the overall paediatric population (2-17 years). 
 similar to adults, bsa-based dosing would hence also be recommended in adolescents age 15-17 years of 
 age. overall, there is no scientific rational to assume that adolescents between 15-17 years of age 
 experience different exposure levels, nor is there any rationale to assume that, based on similar 
 exposure, this would result in a clinically meaningful response difference in patients with cd33-positive 
 de novo aml treated in line with the adult 3+7 induction chemotherapy backbone in combination with 
 mylotarg.</p><p>
 no formal pk studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with hepatic 
 impairment. based on a population pk analysis, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hp67.6 
 antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is not expected to be affected by mild hepatic impairment 
 status, as defined by national cancer institute organ dysfunction working group (nci odwg). the 
 analysis included 406 patients in the following nci odwg impairment status categories: mild (b1, n=58 
 and b2, n=19), moderate (c, n=6), and normal hepatic function (n=322) (smpc section 5.2). no 
 adjustment of the starting dose is required in patients with hepatic impairment defined by total bilirubin 
 ≤</p><p>2 × upper limit of normal (uln) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast)/alanine aminotransferase (alt) 
 ≤</p><p>2.5 × uln. mylotarg should be postponed until recovery of total bilirubin to ≤</p><p>2 × uln and ast and alt to 
 ≤</p><p>2.5 × uln prior to each dose (smpc section 4.2).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 no formal pk studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>based on a population pk analysis in 406 patients, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients 
 with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [clcr] 60-89 ml/min; n=149) or moderate renal 
 impairment (clcr 30 59 ml/min; n=47), was similar to patients with normal renal function (clcr 
 ≥ 90 ml/min; n=209). the pk of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
 impairment (smpc section 5.2). no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal 
 impairment. mylotarg has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. mylotarg does not 
 undergo renal clearance, the pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment is unknown 
 (smpc section 4.2). 
 no formal drug-interaction studies have been performed with go (smpc section 4.5). 
 in vitro, n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is primarily metabolised via nonenzymatic reduction. 
 therefore, coadministration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome 
 p450 (cyp) or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) drug metabolising enzymes are 
 unlikely to alter exposure to n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (smpc section 5.2).</p><p>
 based on population pk analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with hydroxyurea, dnr, 
 and arac is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the pk of hp67.6 or unconjugated 
 calicheamicin(smpc section 5.2).</p><p> 
 n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to 
 inhibit the activities of cyp1a2, cyp2a6 (tested only using gemtuzumab ozogamicin), cyp2b6, cyp2c8, 
 cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, and cyp3a4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. in vitro, 
 n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to 
 induce the activities of cyp1a2, cyp2b6, and cyp3a4 at clinically relevant concentrations (smpc section 
 5.2).</p><p> 
 in vitro, n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of ugt1a1, ugt1a4, ugt1a6, ugt1a9, and ugt2b7 at clinically relevant concentrations (smpc section 
 5.2).</p><p> 
 in vitro, n-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of p-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp), bile salt export pump (bsep), multidrug resistance 
 associated protein (mrp) 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (mate)1 and mate2k, organic anion 
 transporter (oat)1 and oat3, organic cation transporter (oct)1 and oct2, and organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide (oatp)1b1 and oatp1b3 at clinically relevant concentrations (smpc section 
 5.2).</p><p> 
 based on population pharmacokinetic (pk) analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with 
 dnr and arac is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the pk of these agents (smpc 
 section 5.2).</p><p> 
 saturation of a high percentage of cd33 antigenic sites is presumed to be required for maximum delivery 
 of calicheamicin to leukaemic blast cells. several single agent studies measured target (cd33) saturation 
 post-mylotarg dose in patients with relapsed and refractory aml. across all studies, near maximal 
 peripheral cd33 saturation was observed post-mylotarg dose at all dose levels of 2 mg/m² and above, 
 suggesting that a low dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is sufficient to bind all available cd33 sites</p><p>(smpc, section 5.1).</p><p>
 as with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. definitive conclusions cannot be 
 drawn between the presence of antibodies and potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited 
 number of patients with positive adas. the detection of adas is highly dependent on the sensitivity and 
 specificity of the assay. the incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 65/138</p><p> 
 factors, including assay methodology, circulating gemtuzumab ozogamicin concentrations, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant treatments and underlying disease. for these reasons, 
 comparison of incidence of antibodies to gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the incidence of antibodies to 
 other products may be misleading (smpc section 4.8). mylorarg will be administered to patients who are 
 going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the treatment, with little meaningful clinical impact 
 expected; taking into consideration that mylotarg seems not to be very immunogenic (&lt;1%).the chmp 
 recommended the applicant to evaluate immunogenicity of the batches intended for licensing as part of 
 post-marketing commitment. immunogenicityhas been classified as a potential risk in the risk 
 management plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
 while the pk of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been well-characterised over a wide range of doses, there 
 is no confirmation of the proposed dose and it’s pk in the target population. the pharmacokinetics of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated calicheamicin in patients with aml has been described using 
 a population pk model, with the pharmacokinetics following the proposed gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose 
 simulated in the target population. the chmp recommended the applicant to evaluate gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin metabolites as part of the planned additional pk study mentioned below. 
 the lack of secondary pd data, particularly on qt interval prolongation is reflected as missing information 
 in the rmp, however and the chmp recommended the applicant to evaluate the effect of go on qtc as 
 described in the planned clinical study with the fractionated regimen (see risk management plan). 
 the lack of comprehensive data related to aml genetics such as hierarchy of the leukaemic population, 
 drug efflux intensity in relation to pharmacodynamics and clinical response is unfortunate. the applicant 
 provided additional literature to substantiate this lack of information, based on which the applicant agreed 
 to add the requirement for cd33-positive aml to the indication (see discussion on clinical efficacy).</p><p>
 based on the above, the chmp recommended the applicant to conduct a study in patients with relapsed/ 
 refractory cd33-positive aml, using single agent mylotarg to allow for the collection of additional pk, 
 exposure-response, qtc and anti-drug antibody (ada) data using the current, batches of mylotarg.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.5">2.4.5.

 14 days treatment free interval. this dosing schedule had been chosen based on the results from the dose 
 escalation phase 1 study 101, during which the dose was not escalated beyond 9 mg/m

 combination with 3+7 induction chemotherapy to be 6 mg/m² plus arac 100 mg/m²/day and dnr 45 
 mg/m². both studies were conducted including patients with de novo aml.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 mylofrance 1 study further evaluated the fractionated mylotarg dosing regimen in combination. mylofrance 1 was a multicentre phase 2 uncontrolled trial to assess the safety of fractionated doses of 
 go, given at a dose of 3 mg/m
 2 on days 1, 4 and 7 (max of 5mg per dose) in adult patients age 18 and above with cd33-positive aml in first relapse.</p><p>there were no signs of prolonged myelosuppression. 
 during the treatment period, grade 3 teaes that occurred in &gt;1% patients included sepsis (31.5%), fever 
 (15.8%), rash (10.5%), pneumonia (7%), bleeding (7%), mucositis (3.5%), diarrhea (1.75%), 
 headaches (1.75%), tachycardia (1.75%) and oedema (1.75%). no grade 4 toxicity was observed. no 
 infectious deaths occurred. no grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity was observed. no episodes of vod occurred. the 
 efficacy results were comparable to phase 1 data using the 9 mg/m
 2 dose.</p><p>mylofrance 2 study (18) was a multicentre phase 1/2 dose escalation study aimed to determine the 
 optimal doses of daunorubicin and cytarabine in combination with fractionated doses of mylotarg (3 
 mg/m
 2 on day 1, 4, and 7) in patients age 50–70years with cd33-positive aml in first relapse and adequate ps (ecog 0-1) and organ function. the primary endpoint was to determine the mtd for dnr 
 and arac doses in combination with 3 mg/m2 go on days 1, 4, and 7 (max of 5mg per dose), among three 
 different dose schedules, namely (45, 100), (60, 100), and (60, 200) mg/m
 2. a total of 20 patients were included; no dlt was observed in neither of the three dose levels even after expanding the third dose 
 level to an additional four patients. one grade 4 liver toxicity was observed in the second dose cohort and 
 one grade 3 liver toxicity in the third, but all considered not related to the chemotherapy, but to events of 
 sepsis. the highest tested dose level of dnr 60 mg/m
 2 x 3 days and arac 200 mg/m2 for 7 days was considered tolerable in combination with the low dose fractioned mylotarg.</p><p>cr was obtained in 11/20 
 patients, crp in two patients and pr in one patient. a total of 4 patients experienced disease progression. 
 there were 2 early deaths, one from infection and one from disease progression. 
 furthermore, analyses of the different go dosing regimens (3 mg/m
 2 single dose, 3×3 mg/m2 fractionated and 6 mg/m2 single dose) during induction for the following safety endpoint (30-day and 60-day mortality, haemorrhage, infections, hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity) showed that the single 
 dose of 6 mg/m² resulted in a significant increase early mortality, however, the 3x3 mg/m² fractionated 
 go regimen showed similar 30-day and 60-day mortality rates than the single 3 mg/m² go regimen. the 
 risk of grade 3/4 haemorrhage, grade 3/4 infections and hepatotoxicity seems not increased with the 3x3 
 mg/m² fractionated mylotarg regimen compared to single 3 mg/m² or 6 mg/m². the risk of persistent 
 neutropenia was not increased by the addition of go to the intensive chemotherapy, but the risk of 
 persistent thrombocytopenia increased with the 3x3 mg/m² fractionated regimen. 
 regarding the single dose of mylotarg administered during the 2 courses of consolidation, this didn’t 
 result in cumulative toxicity; certainly not for those who tolerate go during induction. 
 overall this confirmed the 3x3 mg/m2 fractionated go dosing regimen in combination with dnr 60 
 mg/m
 2 x 3 days and arac 200 mg/m2 for 7 days to be tolerable with comparable efficacy results to phase 1 data using the 9 mg/m

 patients who experienced cr could be considered for allogeneic transplant. patients with favourable and intermediate i cytogenetic and molecular risk categories were not sent for transplant in first cr. an 
 interval of 2 months between the last dose of mylotarg and transplant was recommended. in that respect 
 is noted that publications recommend an even longer interval between last mylotarg dose and hsct, ie 3 
 month (18). nonetheless, the chosen interval was based on investigators’ recommendation. the type of

 evaluation schedule/ follow-up 
 clinical and haematological responses were assessed after induction, before each course of consolidation 
 and at one to two months after hematologic recovery from the last cycle of consolidation therapy. full 
 blood count (fbc) was assessed 1) at the pre-treatment evaluation, 2) three times per week during 
 induction and consolidation, and 3) at the end of treatment visit. the bma was done 1) on day 15 after

 the overall results of these 4 trials were that remission rates were not improved, although relapse was 
 reduced in 4 of 5 trials with a significant survival benefit observed in ncri trial aml16 comparing a single 
 dose of go (3 mg/m²) to induction chemotherapy, consisting of either da 3+10 in course 1 and 3+8 in 
 course 2 or dclo (dnr plus clofarabine) (data not shown).</p></section><section><header>paediatric data</header><p>in a randomised study (cog aaml0531) that evaluated standard chemotherapy alone or combined with mylotarg in 1,022 newly diagnosed children (94.3% of patients &lt; 18 years of age), and young adults 
 (5.7% of patients); median age was 9.7 years (range: 0.003 29.8 years), patients with de novo aml were 
 randomly assigned to either standard 5 course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with 2 
 doses of mylotarg (3 mg/m
 2/dose) administered once in induction course 1 and once in intensification course 2. the study demonstrated that addition of mylotarg to intensive chemotherapy improved efs (3 
 years: 53.1% versus 46.9%; hr 0.83; 95% ci: 0.70 0.99; p=0.04) in de novo aml owing to a reduced 
 relapse risk, with a trend towards longer os in the mylotarg arm which was not statistically significant (3 
 years: 69.4% versus 65.4%; hr 0.91; 95% ci: 0.74 1.13; p=0.39). however, it was also found that 
 increased toxicity (post remission toxic mortality) was observed in patients with low risk aml which was</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>alfa trial inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally acceptable. the fact that only patients age 50-70 were included is not considered an issue in view of the proposed target population, as it reflects a 
 representative majority of patients with de novo aml eligible to undergo intensive chemotherapy with 
 curative intent. the issue which consequently needed to be addressed in this context is what the 
 acceptable lower age cut-off is for which extrapolation of efficacy is considered acceptable, assuming 
 similar exposure levels and disease similarity (see discussion below). patients were not required to be 
 cd33-positive, but expression of cd33 will be a requirement for the intended indication considering the 
 mechanism of action of mylotarg. the chosen treatment schedule of induction/ consolidation therapy as</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 102/138</p><p> 
 add on to mylotarg is considered standard of care for patients with de novo aml. the issue around the response assessment</p><p>being performed by the unblinded investigators involved in the treatment of the 
 patients has been addressed by the introduction of a birc, though defined in retrospectively. 
 the sample size is acceptable. the methods of analyses are also acceptable. however, for the primary 
 endpoint the sensitivity analysis using the birc and most mature data set (ie april 2013) is the most 
 appropriate and will therefore be the main focus.</p><p>
 major protocol deviations were recorded for almost 50% of all patients (139/280). a total of 22 patients 
 (8%) had a major protocol deviation around lack of eligibility, slightly more in the control arm (7 patients 
 go arm; 15 control arm). overall, this posed the question to whether trial documentation was according 
 to protocol and raises concerns around the robustness of the primary data. however, the additional 
 sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results observed.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>demographics and baseline characteristics were as expected for a de novo aml population age 50-70. there were no major discrepancies between the two groups apart from slightly more male (54.8% vs 
 44.1%) and patients older than 60, respectively 65 years of age in the go arm (71.9% vs 61.8%; 37% 
 vs 29.4%). this can be considered to be in its favour, appreciating that elderly patients usually perform 
 worse. the majority had a ps of 0-1 (87.8%) and favourable/intermediate risk aml as per nccn/eln 
 criteria as well as according to cytogenetics. genotyping revealed more patients with unfavourable 
 genetics, but with almost 50% of data missing or unknown, which limits its usefulness. patient numbers 
 were equally balanced during induction. more patients in the control arm needed a second course of 
 induction (34 vs 19). this could be a sign of early efficacy or due to a higher number of patients with 
 resistant disease in the control arm (discontinuation due to resistant disease in the control arm 26 vs 17 
 patients in go). patients receiving one, respectively two courses of consolidation were also equally 
 balanced across arms. the different follow-up interventions used for patients (with at least 1 follow-up), 
 particularly consolidation regimens for those in cr/crp were equally distributed between the control and 
 investigational arm either (all go 27.3% vs control 28%; consolidation go 19.1% vs control 18%), with 
 no impact expected on efs. 
 the primary efficacy analysis, investigators review and data cut of august 2011 showed an efs difference 
 of 7.8 months (hr 0.562; 95% ci: 0.415-0.762; 2-sided p=0.0002), corresponding to a 44% reduction 
 in the risk of an event for patients in the go arm. these results were consistent when stratified by nccn 
 or eln classification. additional sensitivity analyses, derived by using birc data, different censoring and 
 more mature data cut off dates were consistent with the primary analysis, but less compelling. using the 
 most conservative analysis performed, (birc and most mature data set - april 2013), the hr was 0.705 
 (95% ci [0.536-0.928]; p= 0.0161), when stratified according to eln. additional sensitivity analyses 
 confirmed the robustness of the primary endpoint, including analysis using data from the birc, with 
 latest data cut off, salvage therapy classified as induction failure and the date of randomisation as date of 
 induction failure event (according to guideline ema/chmp/205/95 rev.5).</p><p>
 regarding the secondary endpoints, rfs confirmed a statistical significant difference in favour of the go 
 arm (hr 0.656, 95% ci [0.466, 0.922], p= 0.02480) stratified for eln risk category.</p><p>response rate, 
 including early response (cr/crp at day 15 as part of a post hoc analyses), and most importantly os did 
 not show any statistically significant difference. survival data are available up to april 20130 and can be 
 considered mature.</p><p>
 overall, the efficacy results from the pivotal trial supported by the meta-analysis showed that mylotarg 
 added to induction chemotherapy improved efs through prolongation of remission following initial</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 103/138</p><p> 
 chemotherapy, rather than increasing the number of patients who achieve complete remission, as confirmed by the absence of a statistically significant difference in the orr. subgroup analyses of efs 
 indicated a more encouraging treatment effect with the mylotarg combination in patients with 
 favourable/intermediate risk cytogenetics (hr 0.591; 95% ci (0.407, 0.857), p= 0.0047; vs 
 unfavourable hr 1.08). reflecting on the differences observed for the different risk groups, it can be 
 hypothesised that patients with adverse cytogenetics who receive fractioned low dose of mylotarg seem 
 to exhibit less deep responses, translating into shorter, not statistically significant periods of remission. it 
 can be argued that, based on distinct biological characteristics, with the pathophysiological route causes 
 yet to be fully elucidated, the hard-to-treat poor cytogenetic patient group is less susceptible to mylotarg 
 based induction chemotherapy.</p><p>adequate wording has been added in section 4.4 of the smpc to reflect 
 on the need to individually consider the benefit/risk profile in patients, particularly with adverse 
 cytogenetics, once results become available.</p><p>
 the results of the ipd meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in terms of the secondary 
 endpoint of efs, for the subgroup of adverse risk cytogenetics. this is in addition to rfs, not statistically 
 significant, but showing a supportive trend of benefit in patients with adverse cytogenetics. while it is 
 agreed that the total numbers of the meta-analysis which include all risk groups, are supportive of a 
 survival benefit, the differences in the sub-groups are evident in the meta-analysis and broadly consistent 
 with the pivotal trial, showing no benefit of mylotarg treatment in patients with adverse risk cytogenetics 
 (or of 1), as opposed to the favourable/ intermediate risk group.</p><p>
 additionally, it must be emphasized that apl is not included in the pivotal trial and this has been reflected 
 in the indication.</p><p>
 aml is a heterogeneous disease, stratified into different disease risk groups. there are also additional 
 established independent risk factors, such as age, which is a poor risk factor in adults, associated with 
 higher rates of poor risk cytogenetics. efficacy for the intended indication for patients less than 50 years 
 of age is based on full extrapolation, as the pivotal alfa trial only recruited patients age 50-70 years. it 
 is agreed that mylotarg is considered to have a positive benefit/risk in all patients with newly diagnosed 
 cd33-positive aml age 18 and above. this is based on disease similarity, acknowledging that any 
 associated (known or unknown) biological differences due to age do not alter the assumed clinically 
 meaningful benefits for this patient group.</p><p> 
 no clinical impact of the shift in the aas could be observed based on the comparability exercise. no clear 
 efficacy differences were observed in the data submitted (see also 2.2.4 discussion on chemical, 
 pharmaceutical and biological aspects).</p></section><section><header>assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy</header><p>during the initial evaluation, the chmp raised a concern about the indication needing to be further discussed, with reference to the lower age cut-off for which extrapolation of efficacy is considered 
 acceptable based on disease similarity. it is now difficult to acknowledge to why one would consider a 
 treatment benefit in a patient with aml treated with mylotarg in combination with 3+7 induction 
 chemotherapy at the age of 18 years established, but not at the age of 17 years. the chmp acknowledged 
 that there are differences in the frequency of aml subtypes and common molecular aberrations between 
 adults and children in general. in a large survey evaluating the age effect on aml biology and response to 
 therapy among paediatric patients, differences were seen in infants, but a distinct biology in tya patients 
 could not be identified (36). in addition, prospective studies that included both paediatric and adult 
 patients did not report any outcome differences for the group of tya patients ((37) (38)).</p><p>this is reflected 
 in clinical practice, as indeed tya patients with de novo aml may be treated using adult protocols, such</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 104/138</p><p> 
 as 3+7 induction chemotherapy (39). overall, based on disease similarity, it can be concluded that tya patients age 15-17 years with cd33-positive aml derive the same benefits than adults from the adult 3+7 
 induction chemotherapy in combination with mylotarg. furthermore, the pk modelling results confirmed 
 the pk similarity between adults and adolescents, supporting the assumption of similar exposure between 
 adults and adolescents using bsa based dosing (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). this is further 
 supported by the efficacy data from the meta-analyses, which is used as supportive evidence to bridge 
 efficacy assumptions to patients less than 50 years of age. the subgroup of tya patients (15-29 years of 
 age, n=132), showed efficacy trends similar to the overall population, if not slightly better. regarding 
 safety it is noted that the 30 and 60-day mortality for tya patient (15-29 years of age) in the mylotarg 
 arm was none. despite the limited number, all of this is reassuring, as it confirms what is already known, 
 younger tya patients tend to tolerate intensive chemotherapy better than older patients.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.2">2.6.2.

 neutropenia 
 during the induction phase, 121 (92.4%) patients in the go arm and 125 (91.2%) patients in the control arm had a documented neutrophil recovery to anc of 500/mm
 3, and 118 (90.1%) patients in the go arm and 120 (87.6%) patients in the control arm had a neutrophil recovery to anc of 1000/mm
 3. overall the majority of patients experienced severe myelosuppression with similar rates in both treatment arms and 
 by treatment period. this is supported by the similar median number of rbc transfusions required per 
 patient (14.0 in each arm). there was slightly increasing proportion of patients who recovered in the 
 subsequent treatment phases post induction (all patients, threshold 1000/mm
 3: consolidation 1 90.1%, consolidation 2 93.8%).</p><p>
 the ipd meta-analysis confirmed that the odds to experience severe neutropenia tends not to be different 
 between go and no go treatment.</p><p>
 thrombocytopenia</p><p>the median times to recovery of platelets at either threshold (50.00/mm3 or 100.000/mm3) were longer for patients in the go arm than in the control arm (days 34 vs 29, respectively 35 vs 30 days). this is 
 supported by the higher median number of platelet transfusions required in the go arm compared to the 
 control (median 23 vs 12). more patients tended to recover to the respective threshold following 
 subsequent cycles (100.000/mm
 3 go arm: consolidation 1 73.2%, 85.4% consolidation 2), which could be explained by the less intensive mylotarg schedule (ie only one dose per consolidation cycle). data from 
 the pooled monotherapy studies 201, 202, 203 showed that patients younger than 60 years had a higher 
 probability to recover to the above platelet thresholds. similar figures presented for the afla trial showed 
 no such correlation. 
 although the ipd meta-analysis could not show a statistically significant difference to experience an 
 increase odds for severe thrombocytopenia in the go arm, significant heterogeneity was observed 
 between the single and fractioned 3 mg/m2 dosing schedule (p=0.00007), with persistent 
 thrombocytopenia occurring in 16.3% of patients randomized to go 3 × 3 mg/m² fractionated, compared 
 to 1.5% of patients in the no go arm (or 6.23, 95% ci: 2.70-14.39, p=0.00002). this in general 
 emphasises a potential risk increase due to the fractioned dosing schedule.</p><p>
 haemorrhage teaes of haemorrhage of any grade occurred in the alfa trial in the majority of patients in both treatment arms, with a higher rate in the go arm: 118 (90.1%) patients in the go arm and 107 (78.1%) 
 patients in the control arm. this included grade 
 ≥ 3: 22.9% go arm vs 9.5% control; serious events 8.4% vs 1.5% in control; unresolved 13.7% vs 7.3% and death go 2.3% vs 0.7%. 
 treatment with go resulted in a delay in recovery of thrombocytopenia as well as higher percentages of 
 persistent thrombocytopenia and an increased incidence of bleeding. the ipd meta-analysis showed that 
 the odds to experience grade 3/4 haemorrhage was higher during induction (prelisted safety source: 
 induction or 2.16 [95% ci (1.46-3.20); p=0.0001] vs treatment period or 1.87 [95% ci (1.32-2.65); 
 p=0.0004].</p><p>

 2 (1.5%) patients. fatal severe infection was reported in 2 (1.53%) patients in the mylotarg arm and 4 (2.92%) patients in the control arm (smpc, section 4.8). the incidence of severe infections (grade 3/4) tended to be lower in the monotherapy studies in the 
 relapsed aml setting (studies 201, 202, 203) compared to the setting of add-on mylotarg to 
 chemotherapy in the de novo population (monotherapy: 40.5% of patients with grade 
 ≥ 3 vs 78% in alfa trial and 81.4% in ipd meta-analysis). there is also no difference in frequency of events between 
 go and no go in the alfa trial (go: 102 patients [77.9%] vs control 106 patients [77.4%]; serious 
 40.5% go vs 36.5% in control; not resolved 3.8% go vs 3.8% control; death 1.5% go vs 2.9% control) 
 and no difference in time with severe infections between the arms (median weeks 2.7 go vs 2.4 control), 
 though a broader time range can be seen in the go arm (0-70.4 weeks go vs 0-56.6 control).</p><p>
 the meta-analysis showed no statistically significant increase in odds to experience a grade 3/4 infection. 
 there was a trend for a slight increase in the or when comparing the odds during all treatment periods 
 and the induction phase (all treatment period or 0.85 (95%ci [0.6-1.21]) vs induction treatment period 
 or 1.08 (95%ci [0.8-1.46]). 
 mrc cytogenetic risk was found to suggest heterogeneity in or (p=0.07); patients in the go arm with 
 favourable risk disease had lower odds of infection than those in the no go arm (or 0.41, 95% ci: 
 0.19-0.90, p=0.03).</p><p>
 hepatotoxicity, including hepatic vod/sos in the combination therapy study, vod and hepatic laboratory abnormalities were collected. additional characterisation of hepatotoxicity adverse reactions is provided from the monotherapy studies. 
 in the combination therapy study (n=131), vod was reported in 6 (4.6%) patients during or following 
 treatment, 2 (1.5%) of these reactions were fatal. five (3.8%) of these vod reactions occurred within 28 
 days of any dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. one vod event occurred more than 28 days of last dose of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin; with 1 of these events occurring a few days after having started an hsct 
 conditioning regimen. the median time from the last gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose to onset of vod was 
 9 days (range: 2-298 days). vod was also reported in 2 patients who received mylotarg as a follow-up 
 therapy following relapse of aml after chemotherapy treatment in the control arm of the combination 
 therapy study. both of these patients experienced vod more than 28 days after the last dose of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin. one of these patients experienced vod 25 days after the subsequent hsct 
 (smpc, section 4.8).</p><p> the potential association of key variables with the risk of developing vod (both vod observed at any time 
 following exposure to go and vod within 28 days of any dose of go) was assessed by logistic regression. 
 the analysis included adult patients treated with go monotherapy from all relapsed/refractory aml 
 studies except dose-finding study 103, and had data for all key variables. the covariates evaluated in this 
 analysis were age, sex, starting dose of go (mg/m2), total dose of go (in mg), number of go doses, 
 baseline alt, baseline ast, baseline bilirubin, hepatic impairment baseline (categorised into 2 categories 
 moderate/severe and none/mild) and indicator of hsct (prior and follow-up). 
 based on this analysis of potential risk factors, adult patients who received mylotarg as monotherapy, 
 patients who had received an hsct prior to gemtuzumab ozogamicin exposure were 2.6 times more likely 
 (95% ci: 1.448-4.769) to develop vod compared to patients without hsct prior to treatment with 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin; patients who had received an hsct following treatment with gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin were 2.9 times more likely (95% ci: 1.502-5.636) to develop vod compared to patients 
 without hsct following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; and patients who had moderate/severe</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 hepatic impairment at baseline were 8.7 times more likely (95% ci: 1.879-39.862) to develop vod compared to patients without moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline (smpc, section 4.8). 
 myelosuppression in the combination therapy study in patients with previously untreated de novo aml treated with fractionated doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy, grade 3/4 decreases 
 in leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets were observed in 131 (100%), 124 (96.1%), and 131 (100%) 
 patients, respectively (smpc, section 4.8). 
 during the induction phase, 109 (83.2%) and 99 (75.6%) patients had platelet recovery to counts of 
 50,000/mm
 3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. the median times to platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm
 3 and 100,000/mm3 were 34 and 35 days, respectively. during the consolidation 1 phase, 92 (94.8%) and 71 (73.2%) patients had a platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm
 3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. the median times to platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm
 3 and 100,000/mm3 were 32 and 35 days, respectively. during the consolidation 2 phase, 80 (97.6%) and 70 (85.4%) patients had a

 (8 [7.4%] patients at the induction phase and 8 [8.5%] patients at the consolidation 1 phase and 
 10 [13.2%] patients at the consolidation 2 phase) (smpc, section 4.8).</p><p>during the induction phase, 121 (92.4%) and 118 (90.1%) patients had a documented neutrophil 
 recovery to anc of 500/mm
 3 and 1,000/mm3, respectively. the median time to neutrophil recovery to anc of 500/mm
 3 and 1,000/mm3 was 25 days. in the consolidation 1 phase of therapy, 94 (96.9%) patients had neutrophil recovery to counts of 500/mm
 3, and 91 (94%) patients recovered to counts of 1,000/mm
 3. the median times to neutrophil recovery to anc of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 were 21 and 25 days, respectively. in the consolidation 2 phase of therapy, 80 (97.6%) patients had neutrophil

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>safety data collected in a prospective open-ended manner, in line with regulatory requirements, describing all grades of severity (grade 1 and 2 missing) and accurately reflecting the respective 
 frequencies are not available from the alfa trial. but the extensive experience with mylotarg in clinical 
 trials and the fact that it is still licensed in japan allows a reassuring qualitative description of the safety 
 profile. a total of 2.747 patients received go either as monotherapy or in combination chemotherapy.</p><p>
 the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) in the combination therapy study were haemorrhage and 
 infection. in monotherapy studies the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) included pyrexia, 
 nausea, infection, chills, haemorrhage, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, headache, stomatitis, 
 diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and neutropenia (smpc section 4.8). 
 most aes associated with go use could be considered expected in the patient population, ie 
 meylosuppression, infections or gi events. but there are ae socs (predefined) observed with increased 
 incidence, such as grade 3/4 mucosal toxicity (16.0% vs 6.6%), pain (14.5% vs 3.6%), and the 
 composite of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea (16.8% vs 10.2%). others considered more directly 
 related to mylotarg and it’s on and off target effects, are prolonged thrombocytopenia and consequential 
 increased incidence of serious events of haemorrhage (go 8.4% vs 1.5%), or hepatotoxicity (8.6% vs 
 2.2%), including vod (go 4.6% vs 1.5%). the increased incidence of toxicity is supported by the 
 meta-analysis showing a significantly higher odd to experience a grade 3 or 4 toxicity with mylotarg 
 added to chemotherapy (odds 1.21 [95% ci 1.03, 1.42], p=0.02), which tends to be even slightly higher 
 for the induction period (odds 1.22 [95% ci 1.05, 1.41], p=0.009).</p><p>
 the same holds true for treatment related saes, with socs of infections and infestations (go 38.2% vs 
 33.6%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (go 34.4% vs 10.9%), and hepatobiliary (go 12.2% vs</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 125/138</p><p> 
 3.6%) observed most. the higher risk to experience a sae is also supported by the ipd meta-analysis (or 1.40, [95% ci: 1.19-1.66], p=0.00006).</p><p>
 in the combination therapy study alfa-0701, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions were 
 hepatotoxicity, including vod/sos (3.8%), haemorrhage (9.9%), severe infection (41.2%), and tumour 
 lysis syndrome (1.5%). in monotherapy studies, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions also 
 included infusion related reactions (2.5%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and neutropenia (34.3%)(smpc 
 section 4.8).</p><p>
 the most frequent (
 ≥</p><p>1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the combination therapy study were thrombocytopenia, vod, haemorrhage and infection. the most frequent (
 ≥</p><p>1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in monotherapy studies were infection, 
 haemorrhage, multi organ failure, and vod (smpc section 4.8). in addition, permanent drug 
 discontinuation due to teaes tends also to be high in the go arm (go discontinuation 49.2% [33/67]; 
 chemotherapy discontinuation 36.7% [18/49]). when comparing to the control arm this trend is 
 confirmed by less teaes reported leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy (13.7% go arm vs 2.2% 
 control arm). this means the likelihood of permanently discontinuing mylotarg due to aes was around 
 25%, and discontinuation of chemotherapy due to any study treatment related ae was almost 6 times 
 higher in the go arm. initially, this raised concerns around drug tolerability and would need to be 
 outweighed by a clinically meaningful improvement in efs. this also showed the importance to only 
 consider patients for treatment with mylotarg induction combination who are considered fit enough by 
 their treating physician. based on this, the chmp considered that mylotarg should be used only in patients 
 eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy (smpc section 4.2).</p><p>
 the rates of selected teaes (infections/ infestations; haemorrhage and vod) were similar between the 
 all treated and responder population. the clear difference between the go arm and the control arm in 
 terms of all grade haemorrhage (90.7% in the go arm versus 81.2% in the control arm and 90.1% in the 
 go arm versus 78.1% in the control arm in responder patients and the overall at population, 
 respectively) and all grade vod (4.6% in the go arm versus 2% in the control arm and 4.6% in the go 
 arm versus 1.5% in the control arm in responder patients and the overall at population, respectively) 
 remains. it is overall agreed that mylotarg leads to an increase of certain teaes, but that there was no 
 worsening of the imbalance between patients who responded and all patients (at). as mentioned, in the 
 overall at population and responder patients, the two most frequent reasons for permanent mylotarg 
 discontinuation were identified to be thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity. in addition to this,</p><p>mylotarg 
 treatment either before or after hsct and baseline moderate/ severe hepatic impairment have been 
 identified as risk factors for an increased risk for developing vod. both are now reflected in the proposed 
 smpc, including adequate monitoring recommended as follows:</p><p>due to the risk of vod/sos, signs and 
 symptoms of vod/sos should be closely monitored; these may include elevations in alt, ast, total 
 bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, which should be monitored prior to each dose of mylotarg, 
 hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. monitoring only total bilirubin may 
 not identify all patients at risk of vod/sos. for patients who develop abnormal liver tests, more frequent 
 monitoring of liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity is recommended. for patients 
 who proceed to hsct, close monitoring of liver tests is recommended during the post-hsct period, as 
 appropriate. no definitive relationship was found between vod and time of hsct relative to higher 
 mylotarg monotherapy doses, however, the alfa-0701 study recommended an interval of 2 months 
 between the last dose of mylotarg and hsct (smpc, section 4.4). 
 management of signs or symptoms of hepatic toxicity may require a dose interruption, or discontinuation 
 of mylotarg. in patients who experience vod/sos, mylotarg should be discontinued and patients treated 
 according to standard medical practice (smpc, sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 126/138</p><p> 
 in clinical studies, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, and pancytopenia, some of which were life-threatening or fatal, were reported. 
 complications associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may include infections and 
 bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions respectively. infections and bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were 
 reported, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. 
 complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of mylotarg. during treatment, patients 
 should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
 myelosuppression. routine clinical and laboratory surveillance testing during and after treatment is 
 indicated. management of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
 myelosuppression, including severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose 
 delay or permanent discontinuation of mylotarg (smpc sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). myelosuppression 
 (severe [grade 
 ≥ 3] and/or serious infection and haemorrhage) been classified as an identified risk in the risk management plan. 
 regarding the different toxicities in relation to the different risk subgroups, it is agreed that similar rates 
 of all grade pre-defined teaes in both arms when classified by eln risk groups has been shown. this is 
 certainly the case for infections and infestations (go arm all patients 77.9%; 80.9% favourable/ 
 intermediate risk; 74.3% adverse risk group), as well as haemorrhage (go arm all patients 90.1%; 94% 
 favourable/ intermediate risk; 85.7% adverse risk group). it is however evident that all grades vod 
 appeared with a higher incidence in patients with adverse risk aml (8.6%), compared to the favourable/ 
 intermediate group (3.6%) and to the all patient population (4.6%). this is in addition to the two fatal 
 cases of vod occurring in the adverse risk group. this is consistent with all-causality saes by the soc 
 ‘hepatobiliary disorders’, which was reported with increasing incidence of 7.7%, 13.8% and 17.1% in 
 patients in the go arm for the favourable, intermediate and poor/adverse risk subgroups, respectively, 
 compared to an overall incidence of 13.0% of all patients in the go arm. similar increase can be observed 
 for the all-causality saes experienced by &gt;5% of patients for septic shock, reported in 2 (7.7%), 5 
 (8.6%) and 4 (11.4%) patients in the go arm as well as thrombocytopenia reported in 3 (11.5%), 17 
 (29.3%) and 13 (37.1%) patients in the go arm for the favourable, intermediate and poor/adverse risk 
 subgroups. the remaining retrospectively collected data showed similar rates of all-grade predefined 
 saes in both treatment arms when patients were classified by eln criteria. consistent positive 
 benefit/risk across all cytogenetic risk groups can hence not be concluded (see discussion on clinical 
 efficacy). this has been adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the smpc. 
 the 30-day mortality rate was numerically higher in the mylotarg arm (3.8% vs 2.2%), but similar across 
 arm at 60-days (go 5.3% vs control 5.1%). more induction deaths at day 60 were observed in the 
 poor/adverse risk groups (go 8.6% [3/35] vs control 11.1% [4/36]) compared with the favourable/ 
 intermediate risk groups (3.5% [3/84] go arm vs 4.3% [4/92] control arm). this is consistent for the 
 cytogenetic subgroups, showing more induction deaths in the unfavourable group (d30 go 11.1% [3] vs 
 control 3.3% [1]; d60: 14.8% [4] in go arm vs 10% [3] in control arm) compared to the intermediate 
 group (2.2% [2] in go arm), none with favourable cytogenetics. the trend in mortality difference is 
 supported by the 30 and 60-day mortality results from the meta-analysis with heterogeneity in or 
 observed between cytogenetics risk groups. no overall increase in risk of early mortality between arms is 
 observed.</p><p>
 no clinical impact of the shift in the aas could be observed based on the comparability exercise. no clear 
 safety differences were observed in the comprehensive analysis submitted (see also 2.2.4 discussion on 
 chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects).</p><p>
 in clinical studies infusion related reactions, including anaphylaxis were reported (see section 4.8). there 
 have been reports of fatal infusion reactions in the post marketing setting. signs and symptoms of</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 127/138</p><p> 
 infusion related reactions may include fever and chills, and less frequently hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory symptoms that may occur during the first 24 hours after administration. infusion of 
 mylotarg should be performed under close clinical monitoring, including pulse, blood pressure, and 
 temperature. premedication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is 
 recommended 1 hour prior to mylotarg dosing (see section 4.2). infusion should be interrupted 
 immediately for patients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially dyspnoea, bronchospasm, 
 or clinically significant hypotension. patients should be monitored until signs and symptoms completely 
 resolve. discontinuation of treatment should be strongly considered for patients who develop signs or 
 symptoms of anaphylaxis, including severe respiratory symptoms or clinically significant hypotension 
 (smpc section 4.4). infusion-related reactions (including anaphylaxis) from start of infusion to within 24 
 hours of end of infusion have been classified as an identified risk in the risk management plan. 
 in clinical studies, tls was reported. fatal reports of tls complicated by acute renal failure have been 
 reported in the post marketing setting. in patients with hyperleukocytic aml, leukoreduction should be 
 considered with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis to reduce the peripheral wbc count to below 30,000/mm
 3 prior to administration of mylotarg to reduce the risk of inducing tls. patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of tls and treated according to standard medical practice. appropriate measures to 
 help prevent the development of tumour lysis-related hyperuricaemia, such as hydration, administration 
 of antihyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) or other agents for treatment of hyperuricaemia (e.g., 
 rasburicase) must be taken (smpc sections 4.2 and 4.4). tumour lysis syndrome has been classified as 
 an identified risk in the risk management plan. 
 no effect of the low levels of unconjugated calicheamicin observed after a 3 mg/m
 2 or 9 mg/m2 dose of go on ecg parameters have been identified in non-clinical studies (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
 no safety signal has been identified in clinical trials, but data are insufficient to make a firm conclusion. in 
 conclusion, as no cardiac safety signal has been identified from the clinical trial data of &gt;6000 patients, 
 the chmp recommended the applicant to evaluate the effect of go on qtc as described in the planned 
 clinical study with the fractionated regimen. furthermore cardiac function is considered missing 
 information and this is reflected in the risk management plan. 
 overall, the incidence rate of ada development after mylotarg treatment was &lt; 1% across the 4 clinical 
 studies with ada data. definitive conclusions cannot be drawn between the presence of antibodies and 
 potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited number of patients with positive adas. mylorarg 
 will be administered to patients who are going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the treatment, 
 with little meaningful clinical impact expected; taking into consideration that mylotarg seems not to be 
 very immunogenic (&lt;1%). the chmp recommended the applicant to evaluate immunogenicity of the 
 batches intended for licensing as part of post-marketing commitment.</p><p>immunogenicity has been 
 classified as a potential risk in the risk management plan. 
 management of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
 myelosuppression, including severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose 
 delay or permanent discontinuation of mylotarg (smpc sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
 there are no or limited amount of data from the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in pregnant women. 
 mylotarg must not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the 
 potential risks to the foetus. pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant whilst receiving 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or treated male patients as partners of pregnant women, must be apprised of 
 the potential hazard to the foetus (smpc, section 4.6).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 128/138</p><p> 
 there is no information on fertility in patients. based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. both men and women should seek 
 advice on fertility preservation before treatment (smpc, section 4.6). 
 women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving mylotarg. 
 women of childbearing potential, or partners of females of childbearing potential should be advised to use 
 2 methods of effective contraception during treatment with mylotarg for at least 7 months (females) or 
 4 months (males) after the last dose (smpc, section 4.6). 
 there is no information regarding the presence of gemtuzumab ozogamicin or its metabolites in human 
 milk, the effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. because of the potential for 
 adverse reactions in breast-fed children, women should not breast-feed during treatment with mylotarg 
 and for at least 1 month after the final dose (smpc, section 4.6). 
 mylotarg has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. patients should be advised they 
 may experience fatigue, dizziness and headache during treatment with mylotarg. therefore, caution 
 should be exercised when driving or operating machines (smpc section 4.7). 
 no cases of overdose with mylotarg were reported in clinical experience. single doses higher than 9 
 mg/m
 2 in adults were not tested. treatment of mylotarg overdose should consist of general supportive measures (smpc section 4.9).

 thrombocytopenia with platelet counts &lt; 50,000/mm3 persisting 45 days after the start of therapy for 
 responding patients (cr and incomplete platelet recovery [crp]) occurred in 22 (20.4%) of patients. the 
 number of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia remained similar across treatment courses (8 
 [7.4%] patients at the induction phase and 8 [8.5%] patients at the consolidation 1 phase and 10 
 [13.2%] patients at the consolidation 2 phase). 
 the 30-day mortality rate was numerically higher in the go arm (3.8% vs 2.2%), but similar across arms 
 at 60-days (go 5.3% vs control 5.1%). the increased risk for treatment related mortality in the go arm 
 was driven by increased deaths due to haemorrhage (3.1% vs 0%) and liver toxicity (vod) (1.5% vs 
 0%). 
 the most frequent (
 ≥</p><p>1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the combination therapy study were thrombocytopenia, vod, haemorrhage and infection.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.  
 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>no cardiac safety signal has been identified in clinical trials, but data are insufficient to make a firm conclusion. in conclusion, as no cardiac safety signal has been identified from the clinical trial data of

 the incidence rate of ada development after gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment was &lt; 1% across the 4 
 clinical studies with ada data. definitive conclusions cannot be drawn between the presence of antibodies 
 and potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited number of patients with positive adas. 
 mylotarg will be administered to patients who are going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the 
 treatment, with little meaningful clinical impact expected.the chmp recommended the applicant to 
 evaluate immunogenicity of the batches intended for licensing as part of post-marketing commitment. 
 immunogenicity has been classified as a potential risk in the risk management plan.</p></section><section><header n="3.6">3.6.

 expectance remains poor, highlighting the unmet medical need. any treatment benefit in the de novo setting would be reflected in an increase of patients achieving sustainable first remission rates, allowing 
 more patients proceeding to transplant in case eligible as per individual risk profile, ultimately translating 
 into improvement in os. however, any prolongation of remission could be considered of clinical benefit. 
 particularly when looking at first line treatment and the benefit patients might gain by having a prolonged 
 time off further therapy in a disease in which relapse usually occurs early. the primary endpoint of efs, 
 evaluated in the alfa trial is relevant in this clinical context and it is agreed that efs is a clinically 
 meaningful endpoint. an improvement in efs of around 6 months and a risk reduction to experience an 
 event of around 30% is of clear clinical relevance. the effect on overall survival was less clear although, 
 also based on supportive evidence from a meta-analysis a small favourable effect seems likely. in any 
 case, a detrimental effect in terms of os in the whole population can be ruled out. 
 the efficacy results from the pivotal trial supported by the meta-analysis showed that mylotarg added to 
 induction chemotherapy improved efs through prolongation of remission following initial chemotherapy, 
 rather than increasing the number of patients who achieve complete remission, as confirmed by the 
 absence of a statistically significant difference in the overall response rate. the toxicity associated with 
 go, although expected based on the mechanism of action, was also important, including treatment 
 discontinuation due to aes</p><p>that occurred more frequently in the go arm (13.7%) vs. control arm (2.2 %) 
 and were mainly due to thrombocytopenia and vod.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>in view of the effect in terms of efs and the observed toxicity, and that any remaining uncertainties have been addressed, the benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.  
 additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance</header><p>efficacy for the intended indication for patients less than 50 years of age is based on full extrapolation, as the pivotal alfa trial only recruited patients age 50-70 years. it is agreed that mylotarg is considered to 
 have a positive benefit/risk in all patients with newly diagnosed cd33-positive aml age 18 and above. 
 this is based on disease similarity, acknowledging that any associated (known or unknown) biological 
 differences due to age do not alter the assumed clinically meaningful benefits for this patient group.</p><p>
 however it is difficult to acknowledge to why one would consider a treatment benefit in a patient with aml 
 treated with mylotarg in combination with 3+7 induction chemotherapy at the age of 18 years 
 established, but not at the age of 17 years. the chmp acknowledged that there are differences in the 
 frequency of aml subtypes and common molecular aberrations between adults and children in general. 
 however literature data and efficacy data from the meta-analyses were considered as supportive 
 evidence to bridge efficacy assumptions to patients less than 50 years of age. the subgroup of tya 
 patients (15-29 years of age, n=132), showed efficacy trends similar to the overall population, if not 
 slightly better. regarding safety it is noted that the 30 and 60-day mortality for tya patient (15-29 years 
 of age) in the mylotarg arm was none. despite the limited number, all of this is reassuring, as it confirms 
 what is already known, younger tya patients tend to tolerate intensive chemotherapy better than older 
 patients. 
 the term &quot;de novo&quot; is used in the indication to exclude secondary leukemia, i.e., aml evolving from 
 previous myelodysplasia and forms of acute leukaemia developing after exposure to environmental or 
 therapeutic toxins or radiation (therapy related), as reflected in the pivotal trial (see smpc sections 4.1 
 and 5.1).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/155284/2018</p><p>
 page 135/138</p><p> 
 additionally, it must be emphasized that apl is not included in the pivotal trial and this has been reflected in the indication.</p><p>
 subgroup analyses of efs indicated a more encouraging treatment effect with the mylotarg combination 
 in patients with favourable/intermediate risk cytogenetics. reflecting on the differences observed for the 
 different risk groups, it can be hypothesised that patients with adverse cytogenetics who receive 
 fractioned low dose of mylotarg seem to exhibit less deep responses, translating into shorter, not 
 statistically significant periods of remission. it can be argued that, based on distinct biological 
 characteristics, with the pathophysiological route causes yet to be fully elucidated, the hard-to-treat poor 
 cytogenetic patient group is less susceptible to mylotarg based induction chemotherapy.</p><p>adequate 
 wording has been added in section 4.4 of the smpc to reflect on the need to individually consider the 
 benefit/risk profile in patients, particularly with adverse cytogenetics, once results become available.</p></section><section><header n="3.8">3.8.

 mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (dnr) and cytarabine (arac) for the 
 treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo cd33-positive acute 
 myeloid leukaemia (aml), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl).</p><p>
