 apidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals.</p><p>apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p><p>
 the dose of apidra should be individually adjusted.</p><p>
 administration 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, 
 and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and 
 other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than 
 other injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>
 3 mixing with insulins in the absence of compatibility studies, insulin glulisine must not be mixed with other medicinal products except nph human insulin.</p><p>
 continuous subcutaneous infusion pump</p><p>
 when used with an insulin infusion pump, apidra must not be mixed with diluents or any other 
 insulin.</p><p>
 for further details on handling, see section 6.6.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p> 
 paediatric population there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 6 years.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, nph, lente, etc.), species 
 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dose. concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
 their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia. 
 4</p><p>when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid acting analogues, it may occur earlier. 
 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or 
 death.</p><p> 
 insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation 
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>5</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>the patient&apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. this may constitute a risk in 
 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. the advisability of driving should be 
 considered in these circumstances.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 
 undesirable effects</header><p>hypoglycaemia, the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.</p><p>

 metabolism and nutrition disorders symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. they may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
 concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>
 6 general disorders and administration site conditions systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be 
 life-threatening.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.</p><p>
 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice.</p><p>
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 dose proportionality</p><p>
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 u/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 u/kg or higher, like 
 human insulin.</p><p>
 7 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</p><p>
 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
 insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 8 obesity</p><p>a phase i study carried out with insulin glulisine, lispro and regular human insulin in an obese population has demonstrated that insulin glulisine maintains its rapid-acting properties. in this study, 
 the time to 20% of total auc and the auc (0-2h) representing the early glucose lowering activity 
 were respectively of 114 minutes and 427 mg.kg
 -1 for insulin glulisine, 121 minutes and 354 mg.kg-1 for lispro, 150 minutes and 197 mg.kg-1 for regular human insulin (see figure 2).</p><p>
 figure 2: glucose infusion rates after subcutaneous injection of 0.3 u/kg of insulin glulisine 
 (glulisine) or insulin lispro (lispro) or regular human insulin (regular) in an obese 
 population.</p><p>
 another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid action 
 is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices, while total glucose lowering effect 
 decreases with increasing obesity.</p><p>
 the average total gir auc between 0–1 hour was 102±75 mg/kg and 158±100 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
 0.4 u/kg</p><p>insulin glulisine,</p><p>respectively, and was 83.1±72.8 mg/kg and 112.3±70.8 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
 0.4 u/kg</p><p>insulin</p><p>lispro respectively.</p><p>
 a phase i study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (bmi between 35 and 40 kg/m
 2) with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% ci:0.81, 0.95 (p=&lt;0.01)]has shown that insulin glulisine 
 effectively controls diurnal post-prandial blood glucose excursions.</p><p>
 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-adults in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint. comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>

 type 1 diabetes mellitus-paediatric a 26-week phase iii clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 and 
 8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin 
 glargine or nph as basal insulin. insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
 control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (ghb expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus-adults a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displays dose-proportionality for early, maximum and total exposure in the dose range 0.075 
 to 0.4 u/kg
 .</p><p>
 10 absorption and bioavailability pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure3).</p><p>
 figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes 
 mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 u/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
 intra-subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 obesity another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices.</p><p>
 the time to 10% of total ins exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5–6 min with insulin 
 glulisine.</p><p>
 11 distribution and elimination the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p> 
 special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>

 children and adolescents the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. insulin glulisine was 
 rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar t
 max and cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control 
 than regular human insulin, as in adults (see section 5.1). the glucose excursion (auc</p><p>0-6h) was 641 mg.h.dl

 apidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals.</p><p>apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p><p>
 the dose of apidra should be individually adjusted.</p><p>
 administration 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, 
 and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and 
 other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than 
 other injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>15 mixing with insulins in the absence of compatibility studies, insulin glulisine must not be mixed with other medicinal products except nph human insulin.</p><p>

 special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p>

 hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, nph, lente, etc.), species 
 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dose. concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
 their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia. 
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier. 
 16</p><p>uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death.</p><p> 
 insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation 
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breastfeeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>17</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>the patient&apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. this may constitute a risk in 
 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines). 
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. the advisability of driving should be 
 considered in these circumstances.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>hypoglycaemia, the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.</p><p>

 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>

 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages.</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice.</p><p>
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a</p><p>healthcare professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 dose proportionality 
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 u/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 u/kg or higher, like 
 human insulin.</p><p>
 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
 lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</p><p>
 19 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 were respectively of 114 minutes and 427 mg.kg

 another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid action 
 is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices, while total glucose lowering effect 
 decreases with increasing obesity.</p><p>
 the average total gir auc between 0–1 hour was 102±75 mg/kg and 158±100 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
 0.4 u/kg insulin glulisine,</p><p>respectively, and was 83.1±72.8 mg/kg and 112.3±70.8 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
 0.4 u/kg</p><p>insulin</p><p>lispro respectively.</p><p>
 a phase i study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (bmi between 35 and 40 kg/m
 2) with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% ci:0.81, 0.95 (p=&lt;0.01)]has shown that insulin glulisine 
 effectively controls diurnal post-prandial blood glucose excursions.</p><p>
 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-adults in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 21 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-paediatric a 26-week phase iii clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 and 
 8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin 
 glargine or nph as basal insulin. insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
 control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (ghb expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus-adults a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displays dose-proportionality for early, maximum and total exposure in the dose range 0.075 to 
 0.4 u/kg
 .</p><p>
 22 absorption and bioavailability pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure 3).</p><p>
 figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes 
 mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 u/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
 intra-subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 obesity another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices.</p><p>
 the time to 10% of total ins exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5–6 min with insulin 
 glulisine.</p><p>
 23 distribution and elimination the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p> special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal

 apidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals.</p><p>apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p><p>
 the dose of apidra should be individually adjusted.</p><p>
 administration 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, 
 and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and 
 other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than 
 other injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>

 special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p>

 hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, nph, lente, etc.), species 
 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dose . concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
 their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia. 
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier.</p><p>
 28 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death.</p><p> 
 insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation 
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>

 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines). 
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>the advisability of driving should be

 metabolism and nutrition disorders symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. they may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
 concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>
 30 general disorders and administration site conditions systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life 
 threatening.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.</p><p>
 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice.</p><p>
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a</p><p>healthcare professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes.</p><p>
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin. 
 31 dose proportionality in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 u/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 u/kg or higher, like 
 human insulin.</p><p>
 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
 lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</p><p>
 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
 insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 
 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid action is 
 generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices, while total glucose lowering effect 
 decreases with increasing obesity.</p><p>
 the average total gir auc between 0–1 hour was 102±75 mg/kg and 158±100 mg/kg with 0.2 and

 a phase i study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (bmi between 35 and 40 kg/m
 2) with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% ci:0.81, 0.95 (p=&lt;0.01)]has shown that insulin glulisine 
 effectively controls diurnal post-prandial blood glucose excursions.</p><p>
 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-adults in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 33 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-paediatric a 26-week phase iii clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 and 
 8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin 
 glargine or nph as basal insulin. insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
 control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (ghb expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus-adults a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1, aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displays dose-proportionality for early, maximum and total exposure in the dose range 0.075 to 
 0.4 u/kg
 .</p><p>
 34 absorption and bioavailability pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure3).</p><p>
 figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes

 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
 intra-subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 obesity another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices.</p><p>
 the time to 10% of total ins exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5–6 min with insulin 
 glulisine.</p><p>
 distribution and elimination 
 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 35 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal

 apidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals.</p><p>
 apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p><p>
 the dose</p><p>of apidra should be individually adjusted.</p><p>
 administration 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall,thigh or deltoid or by continuous 
 infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, 
 thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, and 
 consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and other 
 variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than other 
 injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>
 39 mixing with insulins in the absence of compatibility studies, insulin glulisine must not be mixed with other medicinal products except nph human insulin.</p><p>
 before using optiset, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully 
 (see section 6.6).</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p>

 hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, nph, lente, etc.), species 
 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dose. concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed.</p><p>
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dose</p><p>may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
 their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier.</p><p>
 40 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death.</p><p>insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p><p>
 handling of the pen before using optiset, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully. optiset has to be used as recommended in these instructions for use (see section 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation 
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>
 41</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>the patient&apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. this may constitute a risk in 
 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>the advisability of driving should be 
 considered in these circumstances.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>hypoglycaemia, the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.</p><p>

 metabolism and nutrition disorders symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. they may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
 concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>
 general disorders and administration site conditions 42 systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be 
 life-threatening.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.</p><p>
 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice.</p><p>
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a</p><p>healthcare professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 dose proportionality 
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 u/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 u/kg or higher, like 
 human insulin.</p><p>
 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
 lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</p><p>
 43 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p>figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid action 
 is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices, while total glucose lowering effect 
 decreases with increasing obesity.</p><p>
 the average total gir auc between 0–1 hour was 102±75 mg/kg and 158±100 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
 0.4 u/kg</p><p>insulin glulisine,</p><p>respectively, and was 83.1±72.8 mg/kg and 112.3±70.8 mg/kg with 0.2 and

 a phase i study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (bmi between 35 and 40 kg/m
 2) with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% ci: 0.81, 0.95 (p=&lt;0.01)] has shown that insulin 
 glulisine effectively controls diurnal post-prandial blood glucose excursions.</p><p>
 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-adults in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 45 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus-paediatric a 26-week phase iii clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 and 
 8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin 
 glargine or nph as basal insulin. insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
 control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (ghb expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus-adults a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1, aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displays dose-proportionality for early, maximum and total exposure in the dose range 0.075 to 
 0.4 u/kg
 .</p><p>
 46 absorption and bioavailability pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure3).</p><p>
 figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes 
 mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 u/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
 intra-subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 obesity another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices.</p><p>
 the time to 10% of total ins exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5–6 min with insulin 
 glulisine.</p><p>
 47 distribution and elimination the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively. 
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p> 
 special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were

 if optiset is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm up. 
 cold insulin is more painful to inject.</p><p>
 the used optiset must be discarded as required by your local authorities.</p></section><section><header>maintenance</header><p>optiset has to be protected from dust and dirt.</p><p>
 the outside of the optiset can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth.</p><p>
 the pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it.</p><p>
 optiset is designed to work accurately and safely. it should be handled with care. the patient should 
 avoid situations where optiset may be damaged. if the patient is concerned that the optiset may be 
 damaged, he must use a new one.</p><p>50</p></section><section><header>step 1 check the insulin</header><p>after removing the pen cap, the label on the pen and the insulin reservoir should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin.</p><p>
 the appearance of insulin should also be checked: the insulin solution must be clear, colourless, with 
 no solid particles visible, and must have a water-like consistency. do not use this optiset if the insulin 
 is cloudy, coloured or has particles.</p></section><section><header>step 2 attach the needle</header><p>the needle should be carefully attached straight onto the pen.</p></section><section><header>step 3 perform a
  safety test</header><p>prior to each injection a safety test has to be performed.</p></section><section><header>for a new and unused optiset,</header><p>a dose of 8 units is already preset by the manufacturer for the first safety test.</p></section><section><header>in-use optiset,</header><p> a dose of 2 units has to be selected by turning the dosage selector forward till the dose arrow points to 2. the dosage selector will only turn in one direction.</p><p>
 the injection button should be pulled out completely in order to load the dose. the dosage selector 
 must never be turned after the injection button has been pulled out.</p><p>
 the outer and inner needle caps should be removed. the outer cap should be kept to remove the used 
 needle.</p><p>
 while holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped</p><p>with 
 the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.</p><p>
 then the injection button should be pressed all the way in.</p><p>
 if insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. 
 if no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated two more times until insulin appears at 
 the needle tip. if still no insulin comes out, change the needle, as it might be blocked and try again. if 
 no insulin comes out after changing the needle, the optiset may be damaged. this optiset must not be 
 used.</p></section><section><header>step 4  select the dose</header><p>the dose can be set in steps of 2 units, from a minimum of 2 units to a maximum of 40 units. if a dose greater than 40 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections.</p><p>
 the patient must always check if he has enough insulin for the dose.</p><p>
 the residual insulin scale on the transparent insulin reservoir shows approximately how much insulin 
 remains in the optiset. this scale must not be used to set the insulin dose. 
 if the black plunger is at the beginning of the coloured bar, then there are approximately 40 units of 
 insulin available. 
 if the black plunger is at the end of the coloured bar, then there are approximately 20 units of insulin 
 available.</p><p>
 the dosage selector should be turned forward until the dose arrow points to the required dose.</p><p>
 51</p></section><section><header>step 5 load the dose</header><p>the injection button should be pulled out as far as it will go in order to load the pen.</p><p>
 the patient must always check if the selected dose is fully loaded. the injection button only goes out 
 as far as the amount of insulin that is left in the reservoir.</p><p>
 the injection button allows checking the actual loaded dose. the injection button must be held out 
 under tension during this check. the last thick line visible on the injection button shows the amount of 
 insulin loaded. when the injection button is held out only the top part of this thick line can be seen.</p></section><section><header>step 6.  inject the dose</header><p>the patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. the needle should be inserted into the skin</p><p>
 the injection button should be pressed all the way in. a clicking sound can be heard, which will stop 
 when the injection button has been pressed in completely.</p><p> then the injection button should be held 
 down 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle from the skin. this ensures that the full dose of 
 insulin has been delivered..</p></section><section><header>step 7 remove and discard the needle</header><p>the needle should be removed after each injection and discarded. this helps prevent contamination and/or infection as well as entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage, of the insulin, which can 
 cause inaccurate dosing. needles must not be reused.</p><p>
 the pen cap should be replaced on the pen.</p></section><section><header n="7">7. marketing authorisation holder</header><p>sanofi-aventis deutschland gmbh brueningstrasse 50

(see section 5.1).</p><p>
 apidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals.</p><p>
 apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p><p>
 the dose</p><p>of apidra should be individually adjusted.</p><p>
 administration 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, 
 and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and 
 other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than 
 other injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>
 53 mixing with insulins in the absence of compatibility studies, insulin glulisine must not be mixed with other medicinal products except nph human insulin.</p><p>
 before using solostar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully</p><p>
 (see section 6.6).</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p>

 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dose. concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed.</p><p>
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
 their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier.</p><p>
 54 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death.</p><p>insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p><p>
 handling of the pen before using solostar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully. solostar has to be used as recommended in these instructions for use (see section 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation 
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>

 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of

 metabolism and nutrition disorders symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. they may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
 concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>
 general disorders and administration site conditions 56 systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be 
 life-threatening.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.</p><p>
 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice.</p><p>
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a</p><p>healthcare professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 dose proportionality 
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 u/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 u/kg or higher, like 
 human insulin.</p><p>
 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
 lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</p><p>
 57 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> 
 insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p> 
 special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.</p><p>elderly very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p> 
 children and adolescents the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. insulin glulisine was 
 rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar t
 max and cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control 
 than regular human insulin, as in adults (see section 5.1). the glucose excursion (auc</p><p>0-6h) was 641 mg.h.dl
 -1 for insulin glulisine and 801 mg.h.dl-1 for regular human insulin.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data did not reveal toxicity findings others than those linked to the blood glucose lowering pharmacodynamic activity (hypoglycemia), different from regular human insulin or of

 inspect the cartridge before use. it must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid 
 particles visible, and if it is of water-like consistency. since apidra is a solution, it does not require 
 resuspension before use.</p><p>
 empty pens must never be used and must be properly discarded. 
 to prevent any kind of contamination, the use of the pre-filled pen should remain strictly for a single 
 patient use.</p><p>
 mixing with insulins 
 when mixed with nph human insulin, apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. injection should 
 be given immediately after mixing, as no data are available regarding the mixtures made up a 
 significant time before injection.</p><p>
 63</p></section><section><header>handling of the pen the patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet 
 carefully before using solostar</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>schematic diagram of the pen  
 important information for use of solostar:</header><p>• before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be performed. only use needles that are compatible for use with solostar. 
 • special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. • solostar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly.</p><p>
 • the patient must always have a spare solostar available in case the solostar is lost or damaged.</p></section><section><header>storage instructions</header><p>please check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store solostar.</p><p> 
 if solostar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm 
 up. cold insulin is more painful to inject.</p><p>
 the used solostar must be discarded as required by your local authorities.</p></section><section><header>maintenance</header><p>solostar has to be protected from dust and dirt.</p><p> 
 the outside of the solostar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth.</p><p>
 the pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it.</p><p>
 solostar is designed to work accurately and safely. it should be handled with care. the patient should 
 avoid situations where solostar may be damaged. if the patient is concerned that the solostar may be 
 damaged, he must use a new one.</p></section><section><header>step 1 check the insulin</header><p>the label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. the apidra solostar is blue. it has a dark blue injection button with a raised ring on the top. after removing the 
 pen cap, the appearance of insulin should also be checked: the insulin solution must be clear, 
 colourless, with no solid particles visible, and must have a water-like consistency.</p><p>
 64</p></section><section><header>step 2 attach the needle</header><p>only needles that are compatible for use with solostar should be used. a new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. after removing the cap, the needle should 
 be carefully attached straight onto the pen.</p></section><section><header>step 3 perform a
  safety test</header><p>prior to each injection a safety test has to be performed.</p><p>a dose of 2 units has to be selected. 
 the outer and inner needle caps should be removed.</p><p>
 while holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently 
 with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.</p><p>
 then the injection button should be pressed in completely.</p><p>
 if insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. 
 if no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip.</p></section><section><header>step 4  select the dose</header><p>the dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. if a dose greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections.</p><p>
 the dose window must show “0” following the safety test. the dose can then be selected.</p></section><section><header>step 5 inject the dose</header><p>the patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.</p><p>
 the needle should be inserted into the skin. 
 the injection button should be pressed in completely. then the injection button should be held down 
 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. this ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected.</p></section><section><header>step 6 remove and discard the needle</header><p>the needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. this helps prevent contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. needles 
 must not be reused.</p><p>
 special caution must be taken when removing and disposing the needle. recommended safety 
 measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) 
 in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.</p><p>
 the pen cap should be replaced on the pen.</p></section><section><header n="7">7. marketing authorisation holder</header><p>sanofi-aventis deutschland gmbh brueningstrasse 50

 6. further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what apidra is and what it is used for</header><p>apidra contains insulin glulisine. insulin glulisine is produced by biotechnology. insulin glulisine has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 hours.</p><p>
 apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus; it 
 may be given to adults, adolescents and children, 6 years of age and older. diabetes mellitus is a 
 disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use apidra
   do not use apidra</header><p>• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of apidra. • if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia(see box at the end of this leaflet).</p></section><section><header>take special care with apidra</header><p>follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.</p></section><section><header>special patient groups</header><p>if you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 91</p></section><section><header>travel</header><p>before travelling consult your doctor. you may need to talk about - 
 the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
 - 
 supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc, 
 - 
 correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
 - 
 timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
 - 
 the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
 - 
 possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
 - 
 what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.</p></section><section><header>illnesses and injuries</header><p>in the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: -</p><p>if you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).</p><p>
 in most cases you will need a doctor.</p></section><section><header>make sure that you contact a doctor early.</header><p>if you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
 require insulin.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels 
 that are either too low or too high. be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.</p><p>
 tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
 medicines obtained without a prescription. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect 
 your blood sugar level and what action, if any, you need to take.</p></section><section><header>medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:</header><p>- all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
 -</p><p>angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
 blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
 -</p><p>fluoxetine (used to treat depression),

 -</p><p>monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
 -</p><p>pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
 -</p><p>sulfonamide antibiotics.</p></section><section><header>medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:</header><p>- corticosteroids (such as &quot;cortisone&quot;, used to treat inflammation), 
 -</p><p>danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
 -</p><p>diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),

 -</p><p>isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
 -</p><p>oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
 -</p><p>phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
 -</p><p>somatropin (growth hormone),</p><p>
 -</p><p>sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
 treat asthma),</p><p>
 -</p><p>thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
 92 - protease inhibitors (used to treat hiv), 
 -</p><p>atypical antipsychotic</p><p>medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).</p></section><section><header>your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:</header><p>- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),</p><p>
 -</p><p>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).</p><p>
 pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) may 
 weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header>using apidra with food and drink</header><p>your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. your 
 insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. careful control of 
 your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.</p><p>there are no adequate data on the use of apidra in pregnant women.</p><p>if you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
 your diet.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -</p><p>you have hypoglycaemia(low blood sugar levels) 
 -</p><p>you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels). 
 keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
 (such as driving a car or operatingmachines). you should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
 - 
 you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
 - 
 the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of apidra</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use apidra 
  dosage</header><p>based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 93 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate, long-acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
 or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p> 
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. the 
 effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection 
 sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
 one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle the vials</header><p>apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an insulin pump system.</p><p>
 look at the vial before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
 particles in it. do not shake or mix it before use 
 always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. this 
 is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. if you think you may have a problem 
 with apidra, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header>if you have to mix two types of insulin</header><p>apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than nph human insulin.</p><p> 
 if apidra is mixed with nph human insulin, apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. injection 
 should be given immediately after mixing.</p></section><section><header>how to handle an infusion pump system</header><p>apidra must never be mixed with diluents or any other insulin when used in a pump.</p><p> 
 before use of apidra in the pump system you should have received comprehensive instructions of this 
 use. in addition, information about any action to be taken in case of illness, too high or too low blood 
 sugar or failure of the pump system.</p><p>
 use the type of pump system recommended by your doctor. read and follow the instructions that 
 accompany your insulin infusion pump. follow your doctor’s instructions about the basal infusion rate 
 and the mealtime insulin boluses to be taken. to get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect 
 possible malfunction of the insulin pump, you should measure your blood sugar level regularly.</p><p>
 the infusion set and reservoir should be changed every 48 hours using aseptic technique. 
 94</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of pump system failure?</header><p>you should always have alternative insulin available for injection under the skin in case of pump system failure.</p></section><section><header>mistakes in dosage  if you use more apidra than you should</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
 eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
 box at the end of this leaflet.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to use apidra</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have missed a dose of apidra</header><p>or if you</p></section><section><header>have not injected enough insulin,</header><p>your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. for information on 
 the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.</p><p>
 - do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p></section><section><header>if you stop using apidra</header><p>this could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). do not stop apidra without 
 speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.</p><p>
 if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, apidra can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious</header><p>. if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be

 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
 example through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
 you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia</header><p>thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and</p><p>glucose and ketone bodies</p><p>in urine. stomach pain, fast and deep 
 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
 resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
 occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 99</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast : 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain 
 examples of</p><p>symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be weaker 
 or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you</p><p>suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and evenfaint) before you are aware of the 
 problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
 can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you are not 
 confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
 you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
 (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>
 tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.

  dosage</header><p>based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 103 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
 or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p> 
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. the 
 effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection 
 sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
 one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle the cartridges</header><p>the cartridges are to be used in conjunction with an insulin pen such as optipen and other pens suitable for apidra cartridges, and as recommended in the information provided by the device 
 manufacturer.</p><p> the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
 attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
 before insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen, the cartridge must be stored at room 
 temperature for 1 to 2 hours.</p><p>
 look at the cartridge before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
 particles in it.</p><p>
 do not shake or mix it before use.</p></section><section><header>special care before injection</header><p>air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). empty cartridges must not be refilled.</p><p>
 to prevent any kind of contamination, the reusable pen should be used only by you.</p></section><section><header>problems with the insulin pen?  
 refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
 if the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
 discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used.</header><p>if the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. however, use only injection syringes which are 
 designed for an insulin concentration of 100 units per millilitre.</p><p>104</p></section><section><header>mistakes in dosage  if you use more apidra than you should</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must

 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
 resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
 occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 109 - you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain 
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in</p><p>
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be weaker 
 or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and evenfaint) before you are aware of the 
 problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
 can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you are not 
 confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
 you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage.</p><p>caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
 (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:</p><p>
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.

  dosage</header><p>based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 113 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat</p><p>high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
 or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p> 
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. the 
 effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection 
 sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
 one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle the cartridges for opticlik</header><p>apidra in cartridge for opticlik has been developed for use in opticlik only</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p> the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
 needle, and administering the insulin injection.</p><p>
 before insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen opticlik the cartridge must be stored at room 
 temperature for 1 to 2 hours. air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see 
 instruction for using pen). empty cartridges must not be refilled.</p><p>
 look at the cartridge before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
 particles in it.</p><p>
 do not shake or mix it before use.</p></section><section><header>problems with opticlik?  refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
 if opticlik is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
 discarded, and a new opticlik has to be used.</header><p>to prevent any kind of contamination, the reusable pen should be used only by you.</p><p>
 if opticlik does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into a syringe for 
 injection. therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. however, use only injection syringes 
 which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 units per millilitre.</p><p>

 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more</p><p>exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 119</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast : 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain 
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be weaker 
 or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you, suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot; using other medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and evenfaint) before you are aware of the 
 problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
 can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you are not 
 confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
 you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
 (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:</p><p>
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.

  dosage</header><p>based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 123 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
 or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p> 
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. the 
 effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection 
 sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
 one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle optiset</header><p>optiset is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glulisine.</p></section><section><header>read carefully the &quot;optiset instructions for use&quot; included in this package leaflet. you must use the pen as described in these instructions for use.</header><p>to prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.</p><p>

 occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 129</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast : 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain 
 examples of</p><p>symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be weaker 
 or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and evenfaint) before you are aware of the 
 problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
 can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you are not 
 confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
 you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage.</p><p>caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
 (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>
 tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.

  dosage</header><p>based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 141 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
 or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p> 
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. the 
 effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection 
 sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
 one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle solostar</header><p>solostar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glulisine.</p></section><section><header>read carefully the &quot;solostar instructions for use&quot; included in this package leaflet. you must use the pen as described in these instructions for use.</header><p>to prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.</p><p>

 for use with solostar (see “solostar instructions for use”).</p><p>
 look at the cartridge sealed in the disposable pen injector before you use it. only use it if the solution 
 is clear, colourless and has no visible particles in it. do not shake or mix it before use.</p><p>

 always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
 carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes.  
  
  
 hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) 
  
 if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
  
 why does hyperglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective,for 
 example through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or</p><p>
 you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot; using other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia</header><p>thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beatand glucose and ketone bodies in</p><p>urine. stomach pain, fast and deep 
 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
 resulting from lack of insulin.</p><p>146</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
 occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occurs?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast : 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain 
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be weaker 
 or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot; using other medicines.) 
 147</p><p>in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and evenfaint) before you are aware of the problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
 can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you are not 
 confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
 you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
 (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>
 tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:</p><p>
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>apidra solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. solostar. instructions for use</header><p>solostar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin.</p><p>your healthcare professional has decided that solostar is right for you. talk with your healthcare professional about proper injection technique 
 before using solostar.</p><p>
 read these instructions carefully before using your solostar. if you are not able to follow all the 
 instructions completely on your own, use solostar only if you have help from a person who is able to 
 follow the instructions. hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. to ensure that you read the dose 
 correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as 
 shown in the illustrations below.</p><p>
 you can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit.</p><p>each pen contains multiple doses.</p><p>
