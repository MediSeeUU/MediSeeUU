 apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
 analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents. 
 the dose of apidra should be individually adjusted. 
 3</p><p> special populations renal impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be 
 diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>elderly limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p> paediatric population there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 6 years.</p><p>
 method of administration</p><p> apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial intravenous use apidra can be administered intravenously. this should be carried out by healthcare professionals. 
 apidra must not be mixed with glucose or ringer’s solution or with any other insulin.</p><p>
 continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
 apidra may be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) in pump systems suitable 
 for insulin infusion with the appropriate catheters and reservoirs. patients using csii should be 
 comprehensively instructed on the use of the pump system. 
 the infusion set and reservoir used with apidra must be changed at least every 48 hours using 
 aseptic technique. these instructions may differ from general pump manual instructions. it is 
 important that patients follow the apidra specific instructions when using apidra. failure to follow 
 apidra specific instructions may lead to serious adverse events. 
 when used with a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, apidra must not be mixed with diluents or 
 any other insulin. 
 patients administering apidra by csii must have an alternative insulin delivery system available in 
 case of pump system failure (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</p><p>apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial for further details on handling, see section 6.6.</p><p>apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge apidra 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. if administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used 
 (see section 4.4). for further details on handling, see section 6.6.</p><p>apidra solostar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 4 apidra solostar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. if administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used 
 (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 subcutaneous use 
 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals or 
 by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion. 
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the 
 risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</p><p>
 the rate of absorption, and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the 
 injection site, exercise and other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a 
 slightly faster absorption than other injection sites (see section 5.2). 
 care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. after injection, the site of 
 injection should not be massaged. patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.</p><p>
 mixing with insulins</p><p>when administered as a subcutaneous injection, apidra must not be mixed with other medicinal 
 products except nph human insulin. 
 for further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
 before using solostar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read 
 carefully (see section 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>traceability in order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number

 transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
 supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, neutral protamine hagedorn 
 [nph], lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of 
 manufacture may result in the need for a change in dose. concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment 
 may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
 developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. there is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
 absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. 
 a sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in 
 hypoglycaemia. blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and 
 dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered.</p><p>
 hyperglycaemia 
 the use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
 may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. 
 5</p><p>hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and 
 may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human 
 insulin. 
 adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or 
 change their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia. 
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier. 
 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, 
 or death.</p><p>insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p><p>apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge pens to be used with apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge apidra 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. if 
 administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be 
 used. the apidra cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
 − juniorstar which delivers apidra in 0.5 unit dose increments − clikstar, tactipen, autopen 24, allstar and allstar pro which all deliver apidra in 1 unit dose increments. 
 these cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only 
 been established with the listed pens (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
 not all of these pens may be marketed in your country.</p><p>
 medication errors 
 medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly long-acting insulins, have 
 been accidentally administered instead of insulin glulisine. insulin label must always be checked 
 before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin glulisine and other insulins.</p><p>apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or handling errors can rapidly lead to 
 hyperglycaemia, ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>prompt identification and correction of the cause 
 of hyperglycaemia or ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis is necessary. 
 cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported when apidra has been given in continuous 
 subcutaneous insulin infusion in pump systems. most of the cases were related to handling errors 
 or pump system failure. 
 interim subcutaneous injections with apidra may be required.</p><p>patients using continuous 
 subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and 
 have alternative insulin delivery system available in case of pump system failure (see section 4.2 and 
 4.8).</p><p>
 excipients 
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
 ‘sodium-free’. 
 apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions.</p><p>
 combination of apidra with pioglitazone 
 6 cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. this should be kept 
 in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and apidra is considered. if the 
 combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight 
 gain and oedema. 
 pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.</p><p>
 apidra solostar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen handling of the solostar pre-filled pen apidra solostar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. if 
 administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump</p><p>is necessary, a vial should be 
 used. before using solostar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read 
 carefully. solostar has to be used as recommended in these instructions for use (see section 6.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to 
 occur. 
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring. 
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) 
 inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, 
 oestrogens, progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
 medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
 blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
 sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, 
 clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or 
 absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of insulin 
 glulisine in pregnant women. 
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development 
 (see section 5.3). 
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential. 
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic 
 control throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and 
 generally increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin 
 requirements decline rapidly. 
 7</p><p>breast-feeding it is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not 
 pass into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration. 
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.</p><p>

 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines). 
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. the advisability of driving should be 
 considered in these circumstances.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profile hypoglycaemia, the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose

 skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, 
 difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and 
 palpitation. hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions 
 and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial cases of hyperglycaemia have been reported with apidra when used with csii (see section 4.4) that has led to diabetic ketoacidosis (dka); most of the cases were related to handling errors or 
 pump system failure. the patient should always follow the apidra specific instructions and always 
 have access to alternative insulin delivery system in case of pump system failure.</p><p>
  skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur 
 during treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear 
 during continued treatment. 
 lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
 absorption. continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
 reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4).</p><p>
  general disorders and administration site conditions systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnoea, allergic 
 dermatitis and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be 
 life-threatening.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v
 .</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>symptoms hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and 
 energy expenditure. 
 there are no specific data available concerning overdoses with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages.</p><p>
 management 
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it 
 is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, 
 biscuits or sugary fruit juice. 
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. glucose 
 must also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 
 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient 
 in order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the 
 reason for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p><p>

 mechanism of action 
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular 
 human insulin.</p><p>the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insulin glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10-20 minutes. after intravenous administration, a faster onset and shorter duration of 
 action, as well as a greater peak response were observed as compared with subcutaneous 
 administration. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin are 
 equipotent when administered by intravenous route. 
 one unit of insulin glulisine has the same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human 
 insulin.</p><p>
 dose proportionality 
 in a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
 displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
 0.15 units/kg,</p><p>
 and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 units/kg or 
 higher, like human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
 lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin. 
 10 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg, 
 at different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycaemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycaemic 
 control as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 obesity 
 a phase i study carried out with insulin glulisine, lispro and regular human insulin in an obese 
 population has demonstrated that insulin glulisine maintains its rapid-acting properties. in this study, 
 the time to 20% of total auc and the auc (0-2h) representing the early glucose lowering activity 
 were respectively of 114 minutes and 427 mg/kg</p><p>for insulin glulisine, 121 minutes and 354 mg/kg 
 for lispro, 150 minutes and 197 mg/kg for regular human insulin (see figure 2).</p><p>

 another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 action is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices (bmi), while total glucose 
 lowering effect decreases with increasing obesity. 
 the average total gir auc between 0-1 hour was 102 ± 75 mg/kg and 158 ± 100 mg/kg with 
 0.2 and 0.4 units/kg insulin glulisine, respectively, and was 83.1 ± 72.8 mg/kg and 112.3 ± 
 70.8 mg/kg with 0.2 and 0.4 units/kg</p><p>insulin</p><p>lispro, respectively.</p><p>
 a phase i study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (bmi between 35 and 40 kg/m
 2) with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% ci: 0.81, 0.95 (p=&lt;0.01)] has shown that insulin 
 glulisine effectively controls diurnal postprandial blood glucose excursions.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>type 1 diabetes mellitus–adults in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
 control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint. comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase 
 in the basal insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro. 
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate post-meal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate pre-meal insulin glulisine 
 (0-15 minutes) or regular insulin (30-45 minutes). 
 12 in the per-protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the pre-meal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>type 1 diabetes mellitus–paediatric a 26-week phase iii clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 
 and 8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine or nph as basal insulin. insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for 
 glycaemic control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (ghb expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values. there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>type 2 diabetes mellitus–adults a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba

 endpoint (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not 
 significant). in this study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph 
 insulin immediately prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycaemic agents at

 pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately 
 twice as high as compared to regular human insulin. 
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 
 0.15 units/kg, for insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µunits/ml compared to a t
 max of 82 minutes and a cmax of 46 ± 1.3 µunits/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin 
 (161 min) (see figure 3). 
 13</p><p>figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 units/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 units/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the c
 max was 91 µunits/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µunits/ml. when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). 
 the absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
 intra-subject variability (11% cv). intravenous bolus administration of insulin glulisine resulted in a 
 higher systemic exposure when compared to subcutaneous injection, with a c
 max approximately 40-fold higher.</p><p>obesity another phase i study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
 absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices. 
 the time to 10% of total ins exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5-6 min with insulin 
 glulisine.</p><p>
 distribution and elimination 
 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
 18 minutes, respectively. 
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis 
 of insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p>insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin.</p><p>14</p><p>special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt;80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt;30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.</p><p>
 elderly very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>children and adolescents the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. insulin glulisine 
 was rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar t
 max and cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control 
 than regular human insulin, as in adults (see section 5.1). the glucose excursion (auc</p><p>0-6h) was 641 mg.h.dl

 refer to section 4.2 and 4.4 for advice.</p><p>
 intravenous use 
 apidra should be used at a concentration of 1 unit/ml insulin glulisine in infusion systems with 
 sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion with or without 40 mmol/l potassium chloride 
 using coextruded polyolefin/polyamide plastic infusion bags with a dedicated infusion line. insulin 
 glulisine for intravenous use at a concentration of 1 unit/ml is stable at room temperature for 
 48 hours. 
 after dilution for intravenous use, the solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
 prior to administration. it must only be used if the solution is clear and colourless, not when cloudy 
 or with visible particles. 
 apidra was found to be incompatible with glucose 5% solution and ringer’s solution and, 
 therefore, must not be used with these solution fluids. the use of other solutions has not been 
 studied.</p><p>
 apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge apidra 100 units/ml in a cartridge is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. if administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump</p><p>is necessary, a vial should be 
 used. the apidra cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: clikstar, autopen 
 24, tactipen, allstar, allstar pro or juniorstar (see section 4.2 and 4.4). not all of these pens 
 may be marketed in your country. 
 the pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.</p><p>
 the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the 
 cartridge, attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. inspect the cartridge before 
 use. it must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible. before 
 insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen, the cartridge must be stored at room temperature for 
 1 to 2 hours. air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instruction for 
 using pen). empty cartridges must not be refilled.</p><p>if the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
 discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
 to prevent any kind of contamination, the re-usable pen should be used by a single patient only. 
 insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between 
 insulin glulisine and other insulins (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 apidra solostar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen apidra solostar 100 units/ml in a pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. if administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump</p><p>is necessary, a vial should be 
 used. before first use, the pen</p><p>must be stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. 
 inspect the cartridge before use. it must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no

 without a needle attached. only use needles that are compatible for use with solostar. 
  special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
  solostar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. 
  the patient must always have a spare solostar available in case the solostar is lost or damaged.</p></section><section><header>storage instructions</header><p>please check section 6.4 of this spc for instructions on how to store solostar.</p><p>
 if solostar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to 
 warm up. cold insulin is more painful to inject.</p><p>
 the used solostar must be discarded as required by your local authorities.</p></section><section><header>maintenance</header><p>solostar has to be protected from dust and dirt.</p><p>
 the outside of the solostar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth.</p><p>
 the pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it.</p><p>
 solostar is designed to work accurately and safely. it should be handled with care. the patient 
 should avoid situations where solostar may be damaged. if the patient is concerned that the 
 solostar may be damaged, he must use a new one.</p><p>

 pen cap, the appearance of insulin should also be checked: the insulin solution must be clear, 
 colourless, with no solid particles visible, and must have a water-like consistency.</p></section><section><header>step 2 attach the needle</header><p>only needles that are compatible for use with solostar should be used. a new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. after removing the cap, the needle 
 should be carefully attached straight onto the pen.</p></section><section><header>step 3 perform a
  safety test</header><p>prior to each injection a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly and to remove air bubbles.</p><p>
 a dose of 2 units has to be selected. 
 the outer and inner needle caps should be removed.</p><p>
 while holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped 
 gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.</p><p>
 then the injection button should be pressed in completely.</p><p>
 if insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. 
 if no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle 
 tip.</p></section><section><header>step 4  select the dose</header><p>the dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. if a dose greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections.</p><p>
 the dose window must show “0” following the safety test. the dose can then be selected.</p></section><section><header>step 5 inject the dose</header><p>the patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.</p><p>
 the needle should be inserted into the skin. 
 the injection button should be pressed in completely. then the injection button should be held down 
 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. this ensures that the full dose of insulin has been 
 injected.</p></section><section><header>step 6 remove and discard the needle</header><p>the needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. this helps prevent contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. needles 
 must not be reused.</p><p>
 20 special caution must be taken when removing and disposing the needle. recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping 
 technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious 
 diseases.</p><p>
 the pen cap should be replaced on the pen.</p></section><section><header n="7">7. marketing authorisation holder</header><p>sanofi-aventis deutschland gmbh d-65926 frankfurt am main

 6. contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what apidra is and what it is used for</header><p>apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus; it may be given to adults, adolescents and children, 6 years of age and older. diabetes mellitus is a 
 disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.</p><p>
 it is made by biotechnology. it has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
 hours.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you use apidra 
  do not use apidra</header><p>- if you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
 section 6). 
 - 
 if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
 box at the end of this leaflet).</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using apidra. follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity 
 (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 40 special patient groups if you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 skin changes at the injection site 
 the injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. the 
 insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see how to use apidra). contact 
 your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different 
 area. your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin 
 or your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p><p>
 travel 
 before travelling consult your doctor. you may need to talk about 
 - 
 the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
 - 
 supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc, 
 - 
 correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
 - 
 timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
 - 
 the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
 - 
 possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
 - 
 what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.</p><p>
 illnesses and injuries 
 in the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
 -</p><p>if you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase 
 (hyperglycaemia). 
 -</p><p>if you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
 in most cases you will need a doctor.</p></section><section><header>make sure that you contact a doctor early.</header><p>if you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. always tell people who are caring for you or treating you 
 that you require insulin.</p><p>
 some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
 were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your 
 doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of 
 breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).</p></section><section><header>other medicines and apidra</header><p>some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar 
 levels that are either too low or too high. be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.</p><p>
 tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
 medicines. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
 -</p><p>all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
 -</p><p>angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
 blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
 41 - fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
 -</p><p>fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
 -</p><p>monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
 -</p><p>pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower 
 fever), 
 -</p><p>sulphonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
 -</p><p>corticosteroids (such as &quot;cortisone&quot; used to treat inflammation), 
 -</p><p>danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
 -</p><p>diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
 -</p><p>glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),</p><p>
 -</p><p>isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
 -</p><p>oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
 -</p><p>phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
 -</p><p>somatropin (growth hormone), 
 -</p><p>sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
 treat asthma), 
 -</p><p>thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
 -</p><p>protease inhibitors (used to treat hiv), 
 -</p><p>atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
 -</p><p>beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
 -</p><p>lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).</p><p>
 pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which 
 may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) 
 may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header>apidra with alcohol</header><p>your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.</p><p>
 inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. your 
 insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. careful control of 
 your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.</p><p>there are no or limited data on the use of apidra in pregnant women.</p><p>42 if you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -</p><p>you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
 -</p><p>you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels).</p><p>
 keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
 (such as driving a car or using machines).</p><p>
 you should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
 - 
 you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
 - 
 the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or 
 absent.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of apidra</header><p>this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p></section><section><header>apidra contains metacresol</header><p>apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use apidra 
  dose</header><p>always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p>
 based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous 
 insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
 intermediate, long-acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too 
 high or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). it may also be given intravenously by healthcare professionals under close supervision by a doctor.</p><p>
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be 
 injected in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal 
 43 wall. the effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) 
 must be rotated from one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>instructions for proper use</header><p>how to handle the vials</p><p>apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an insulin pump system.</p><p>
 look at the vial before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
 particles in it. 
 do not shake or mix it before use.</p><p>
 always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
 this is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. if you think you may have a 
 problem with apidra, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p>
 if you have to mix two types of insulin</p><p>
 apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than nph human insulin.</p><p>
 if apidra is mixed with nph human insulin, apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. injection 
 should be given immediately after mixing.</p><p>
 how to handle an infusion pump system</p><p>
 before using apidra in the pump system you should have been given detailed instructions on how to 
 use the pump system. in addition, you should have been provided with information about what to 
 do if you become ill or if your blood sugar levels get too high or too low, or if the pump system 
 fails.</p><p>
 use the pump system recommended by your doctor. read and follow the instructions that come 
 with your insulin infusion pump. follow your doctor’s instructions about the basal infusion rate and 
 the mealtime insulin boluses to be taken. measure your blood sugar level regularly to make sure you 
 get the benefit of the insulin infusion and to make sure that the pump is working properly.</p><p>
 change the infusion set and reservoir at least every 48 hours using aseptic technique. these 
 instructions may differ from the instructions that come with your insulin infusion pump. when you 
 use apidra in the pump system, it is important that you always follow these specific instructions. 
 failure to follow these specific instructions may lead to serious adverse events.</p><p>
 apidra must never be mixed with diluents or any other insulin when used in a pump.</p><p>
 what to do if the pump system fails or when the pump is used incorrectly</p><p>
 44 pump or infusion set problems or using the pump incorrectly can result in you not getting enough insulin. this can quickly cause you to have high blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of 
 acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).</p><p>
 if your blood sugar level starts to rise, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as 
 possible. they will tell you what needs to be done. 
 you may need to use apidra with syringes or pens. you should always have an alternative insulin 
 delivery system available for injection under the skin in case the pump system fails.</p></section><section><header>if you use more apidra than you should</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
 must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of 
 hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to use apidra</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have missed a dose of apidra</header><p>or if you</p></section><section><header>have not injected enough insulin,</header><p>your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. for 
 information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
 - do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p></section><section><header>if you stop using apidra</header><p>this could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). do not stop apidra without 
 speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.</p><p>
 if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
 nurse.</p></section><section><header>insulin mix-ups</header><p>you must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between apidra and other insulins.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>
 45</p></section><section><header>serious side effects  hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious</header><p>. hypoglycaemia is a very commonly reported side effect (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means that there is not enough sugar in the blood.</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be 
 life-threatening. if you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood 
 sugar level</p></section><section><header>immediately.</header><p>see the box at the end of this leaflet for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its treatment.</p></section><section><header>if you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: systemic allergic reactions</header><p>are side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)</p></section><section><header>generalised allergy to insulin</header><p>: associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), 
 shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. these could be 
 symptoms of severe cases of</p></section><section><header>generalised allergy to insulin, including anaphylactic reaction, which may be life-threatening.
   hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) means that there is too much sugar in the blood.</header><p>the frequency of hyperglycaemia cannot be estimated. if your blood sugar level is too high, this tells 
 you that you may need more insulin than you have injected.</p></section><section><header>hyperglycaemia can cause diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the 
 body is breaking down fat instead of sugar)</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>these are serious side effects. these conditions can happen when there are problems with the infusion pump or when the 
 pump system is used incorrectly. 
 this means you may not always get enough insulin to treat your diabetes</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>if this happens you must seek urgent medical help. always have available an alternative insulin delivery system for injection under the skin</header><p>(see section 3 under “how to handle an infusion pump system” and “what to do if the pump system fails or when the pump is used incorrectly”)</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>for more information on signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia refer to the box at the end of this leaflet.</p></section><section><header>other side effects</header><p> skin changes at the injection site:</p><p>if you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or 
 thicken (lipohypertrophy) (
 may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not 
 known). the insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. change the injection 
 site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.</p></section><section><header>common reported side effects</header><p> (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  skin and allergic reactions at the injection site reactions at the injection site may occur (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection,

 always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
 carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
  
  
 hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) 
  
 if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.</header><p>49</p></section><section><header>why does hyperglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, 
 for example through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), 
 or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra&quot;).</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia</header><p>thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. stomach pain, fast and deep 
 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition 
 (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above 
 symptoms occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p>
 substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p>
 carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other 
 medicines and apidra&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as 
 hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>50 - in your body</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, 
 nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, 
 lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes 
 total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), 
 numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to 
 look after yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be 
 weaker or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly, 
 - 
 you have had diabetes for a long time, 
 - 
 you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 - 
 you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops 
 slowly, 
 - 
 you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra).</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of 
 the problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar 
 testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you 
 are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a 
 car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes 
 or a sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial 
 sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p><p>
 tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
 if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really 
 have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>51</p></section><section><header>the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</header><p>apidra can be administered intravenously, which should be carried out by healthcare professionals.</p></section><section><header>instruction for intravenous administration</header><p>apidra should be used at a concentration of 1 unit/ml insulin glulisine in infusion systems with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion with or without 40 mmol/l potassium chloride 
 using coextruded polyolefin/polyamide plastic infusion bags with a dedicated infusion line. insulin 
 glulisine for intravenous use at a concentration of 1 unit/ml is stable at room temperature for 48 
 hours.</p><p>
 after dilution for intravenous use, the solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
 prior to administration. never use the solution if it has become cloudy or contains particles; use it 
 only if it is clear and colourless.</p><p>
 apidra was found to be incompatible with glucose 5% solution and ringer’s solution and, 
 therefore, must not be used with these solution fluids. the use of other solutions has not been 
 studied.</p><p>52</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user

 disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.</p><p>
 it is made by biotechnology. it has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
 hours.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you use apidra 
  do not use apidra</header><p>- if you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
 section 6). 
 - 
 if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
 box at the end of this leaflet).</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>apidra in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see also section 3). speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using apidra. 
 follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity 
 (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 53 special patient groups if you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>skin changes at the injection site 
 the injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. the 
 insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see how to use apidra). contact 
 your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different 
 area. your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin 
 or your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p><p>
 travel 
 before travelling consult your doctor. you may need to talk about 
 - 
 the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
 - 
 supplies of insulin, needles, etc, 
 - 
 correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
 - 
 timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
 - 
 the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
 - 
 possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
 - 
 what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.</p><p>
 illnesses and injuries 
 in the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
 - 
 if you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase 
 (hyperglycaemia). 
 - 
 if you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
 in most cases you will need a doctor.</p></section><section><header>make sure that you contact a doctor early.</header><p>if you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. always tell people who are caring for you or treating you 
 that you require insulin.</p><p>
 some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
 were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your 
 doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of 
 breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).</p></section><section><header>other medicines and apidra</header><p>some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar 
 levels that are either too low or too high. be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.</p><p>
 tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
 medicines. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
 -</p><p>all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
 -</p><p>angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
 blood pressure),

  dose</header><p>always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p>
 based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous 
 insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
 intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too 
 high or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p>
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be 
 injected in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal 
 wall. the effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all 
 insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) 
 must be rotated from one injection to the next. 
 56</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>instructions for proper use</header><p>how to handle the cartridges</p><p>apidra in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
 to ensure you get the accurate dose, the apidra cartridges are to be used only with the following 
 pens: 
 - juniorstar which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units</p><p>
 - clikstar, tactipen, autopen 24, allstar or allstar pro which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
 not all of these pens may be marketed in your country.</p><p>
 the pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.</p><p> the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the 
 cartridge, attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection.</p><p>
 before insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen, the cartridge must be stored at room 
 temperature for 1 to 2 hours.</p><p>
 look at the cartridge before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no 
 visible particles in it.</p><p>
 do not shake or mix it before use.</p></section><section><header>special care before injection</header><p>air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). empty cartridges must not be refilled.</p><p>
 to prevent any kind of contamination, the reusable pen should be used only by you.</p></section><section><header>problems with the insulin pen?  
 refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
 if the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to 
 be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
  if you use more apidra than you should</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
 must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of 
 hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to use apidra</header><p>57 - if you</p></section><section><header>have missed a dose of apidra</header><p>or if you</p></section><section><header>have not injected enough insulin,</header><p>your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. for

 always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
 carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
  
  
 hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) 
  
 if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
  
 why does hyperglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, 
 for example through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), 
 or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra&quot;).</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia</header><p>thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. stomach pain, fast and deep 
 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition 
 (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above 
 symptoms occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p>
 substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p>
 carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other 
 medicines and apidra&quot;). 
 63</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as 
 hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, 
 nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, 
 lapses in</p><p>
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss 
 of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be 
 weaker or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 - 
 you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 - 
 you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 - 
 you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops 
 slowly, 
 - 
 you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra”).</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of 
 the problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar 
 testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you 
 are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a 
 car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes 
 or a sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial 
 sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
 64</p><p>tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:</p><p>if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really 
 have hypoglycaemia.

 disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.</p><p>
 it is made by biotechnology. it has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
 hours.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you use apidra 
  do not use apidra</header><p>- if you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
 section 6). 
 - 
 if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
 box at the end of this leaflet).</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>apidra in a pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using apidra. 
 follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity 
 (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 special patient groups 
 66 if you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.</p><p>
 there is insufficient clinical information on the use of apidra in children younger than the age of 
 6 years.</p><p>
 skin changes at the injection site 
 the injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. the 
 insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see how to use apidra). contact 
 your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different 
 area. your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin 
 or your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p><p>
 travel 
 before travelling consult your doctor. you may need to talk about 
 - 
 the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
 - 
 supplies of insulin, needles, etc, 
 - 
 correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
 - 
 timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
 - 
 the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
 - 
 possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
 - 
 what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.</p><p>
 illnesses and injuries 
 in the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
 - 
 if you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase 
 (hyperglycaemia).</p><p>
 - 
 if you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
 in most cases you will need a doctor.</p></section><section><header>make sure that you contact a doctor early.</header><p>if you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. always tell people who are caring for you or treating you 
 that you require insulin.</p><p>
 some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
 were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your 
 doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of 
 breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).</p></section><section><header>other medicines and apidra</header><p>some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar 
 levels that are either too low or too high. be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.</p><p>
 tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
 medicines. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
 -</p><p>all other medicines to treat diabetes,

  dose</header><p>always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p>
 based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous 
 insulin usage, your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
 intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are 
 able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too 
 high or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.</p></section><section><header>method of administration</header><p>apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p>
 your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be 
 injected in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal 
 wall. the effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all 
 insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) 
 must be rotated from one injection to the next. 
 69</p></section><section><header>frequency of administration</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p></section><section><header>instructions for proper use</header><p>how to handle solostar</p><p>solostar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glulisine. apidra in a pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
 another method.</p></section><section><header>read carefully the &quot;solostar instructions for use&quot; included in this package leaflet. you must use the pen as described in these instructions for use.</header><p>to prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.</p><p>
 before use always attach a new needle, and perform a safety test. only use needles that are 
 compatible for use with solostar (see “solostar instructions for use”).</p><p>
 look at the cartridge sealed in the disposable pen injector before you use it. only use it if the 
 solution is clear, colourless and has no visible particles in it. do not shake or mix it before use.</p><p>
 always use a new pen</p><p>if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. if 
 you think you may have a problem with solostar, please consult your health care professional.</p></section><section><header>if you use more apidra than you should</header><p>- if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you

 always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
 carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
  
  
 hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) 
  
 if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
  
 why does hyperglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, 
 for example through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), 
 or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra&quot;).</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia</header><p>thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. stomach pain, fast and deep 
 breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition 
 (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above 
 symptoms occur</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. you normally should be able to 
 recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.</p></section><section><header>why does hypoglycaemia occur?</header><p>examples include: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p>
 substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are 
 not</p><p>
 carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other 
 medicines and apidra&quot;). 
 75</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,</p><p>
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
 arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as 
 hypothyroidism.</p></section><section><header>warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia</header><p>- in your body</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 - in your brain</p><p>
 examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, 
 nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, 
 lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes 
 total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), 
 numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to 
 look after yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be 
 weaker or may be missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 - 
 you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 - 
 you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
 - 
 you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops 
 slowly, 
 - 
 you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;other medicines and 
 apidra”).</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of 
 the problem. be familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more frequent blood sugar 
 testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. if you 
 are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a 
 car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes 
 or a sugar-sweetened beverage. caution: artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial 
 sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
 pasta). your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
 76</p><p>tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:</p><p>if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
 glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not 
 certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really 
 have hypoglycaemia. 
 77</p></section><section><header>apidra solostar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. instructions for use</header><p>solostar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. your doctor has decided that solostar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle solostar. talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
 nurse about proper injection technique before using solostar.</p><p>
 read these instructions carefully before using your solostar. if you are not able to use solostar or 
 follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use solostar only if you have help 
 from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. hold the pen as shown in this 
 leaflet. to ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the 
 left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.</p><p>
 you can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. each pen contains multiple doses.</p><p>
 keep this leaflet for future reference. 
 if you have any questions about solostar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse 
 or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet.</p><p> schematic diagram of the pen</p></section><section><header>important information for use of solostar:</header><p> always attach a new needle before each use. only use needles that are compatible for use with solostar. 
  do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.  always perform the safety test before each injection (see step 3).  this pen is only for your use. do not share it with anyone else.  if your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
  never use solostar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.  always have a spare solostar in case your solostar is lost or damaged.</p></section><section><header>step 1. check the insulin

 you may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.</p><p>
  if no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. 
  if still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. change the needle and try again.</p><p>  if no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your solostar may be damaged. do not use this solostar.</p></section><section><header>step 4.  select the dose</header><p>you can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. if you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.</p></section><section><header>a</header><p>. check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test.</p></section><section><header>b</header><p>. select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). if you turn 
 past your dose, you can turn back down.</p><p>
  do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.</p><p>
  you cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. do not force the dosage selector to turn. in this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
 complete your dose with a new solostar or use a new solostar for your full dose.</p></section><section><header>step 5.  inject the dose

 needle from the skin. this ensures that the full dose will be delivered.</p><p>
 the pen plunger moves with each dose. the plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when 
 the total of 300 units of insulin has been used.</p></section><section><header>step 6.  remove and discard the needle</header><p>always remove the needle after each injection and store solostar without a needle attached. this helps prevent: 
  contamination and/or infection,  entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.</p></section><section><header>a</header><p>. put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. 
 to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.</p><p>
  if your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the 
 needle. follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (contact 
 your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and 
 transmission of infectious diseases.</p></section><section><header>b.</header><p>dispose of the needle safely, as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p></section><section><header>c</header><p>. always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.</p></section><section><header>storage instructions</header><p>please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store solostar.</p><p>
 10 secs 81 if your solostar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to room temperature. cold insulin is more painful to inject.</p><p>
 discard your used solostar as required by your local authorities.</p></section><section><header>maintenance</header><p>protect your solostar from dust and dirt.</p><p>
 you can clean the outside of your solostar by wiping it with a damp cloth.</p><p>
 do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.</p><p>
 your solostar is designed to work accurately and safely. it should be handled with care. avoid 
 situations where solostar might be damaged. if you are concerned that your solostar may be 
 damaged, use a new one.</p></section></body></xml>
