 apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous pump infusion.</p><p>
 apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall,</p><p>thigh or</p><p>deltoid or by 
 continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area 
 (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. the rate of absorption, 
 and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and 
 other variables. subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than 
 other injection sites (see section 5.2).</p><p>

 renal impairment 
 the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal 
 impairment. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
 section 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 the pharmacokinetic</p><p>properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with 
 decreased liver function. in patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
 due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</p><p>
 elderly 
 limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. deterioration of 
 renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.</p><p> 
 children and adolescents 
 there is no adequate clinical information on the use of apidra in children and adolescents.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to insulin glulisine or to any of the excipients.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, nph, lente, etc.), species 
 (animal) and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dosage. concomitant oral 
 antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</p><p>
 the use of inadequate dosages or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent 
 diabetic, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially 
 lethal.</p><p>
 hypoglycaemia the time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
 conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
 pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
 medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin.</p><p>
 adjustment of dosage may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or 
 change their usual meal plan. exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 when compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
 acting analogues, it may occur earlier. 
 4 uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death.</p><p> 
 insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>studies on pharmacokinetic</p><p>interactions have not been performed. based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur.</p><p>
 a number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
 glulisine and particularly close monitoring.</p><p>
 substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
 hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, 
 disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase</p><p>inhibitors (maois), pentoxifylline, 
 propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
 diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
 agents (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins 
 (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. 
 olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-
 lowering activity of insulin. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be 
 followed by hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 in addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
 guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy</p><p>there are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine 
 in pregnant women.</p><p>
 animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
 insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
 section 5.3).</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. careful monitoring of glucose 
 control is essential.</p><p>
 it is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
 throughout pregnancy. insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
 increase during the second and third trimesters. immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
 decline rapidly.</p><p>
 lactation</p><p>
 it is unknown whether insulin glulisineis excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
 into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>
 breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
 5</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>the patient&apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. this may constitute a risk in 
 situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery).</p><p>
 patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is 
 particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>the advisability of driving should be 
 considered in these circumstances.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>hypoglycaemia, the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.</p><p>
 the following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations were listed below by system organ 
 class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: &gt;1/10; common: &gt;1/100, &lt;1/10; 
 uncommon: &gt; 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100; rare: &gt;1/10,000, &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt; 1/10,000).</p><p>
 metabolism and nutrition disorders very common: hypoglycaemia symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. they may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, 
 fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
 concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
 hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
 result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders common: injection site reactions and local hypersensitivity reactions. local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during 
 treatment with insulin. these reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
 continued treatment.</p><p>
 rare: lipodystrophy</p><p>
 lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites 
 within an area.</p><p>
 general disorders uncommon: systemic hypersensitivity reactions systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis 
 and pruritus. severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life-
 threatening.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.</p><p>
 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:</p><p>
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice. 
 6 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulin and analogues, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
 insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).

 obesity</p><p>a phase i study carried out with insulin glulisine, lispro and regular human insulin in an obese population has demonstrated that insulin glulisine maintains its rapid-acting properties. in this study, 
 the time to 20% of total auc and the auc (0-2h) representing the early glucose lowering activity 
 were respectively of 114 minutes and 427mg.kg

 8 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the 
 premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m

 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to</p><p>the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58 % of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>

 pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for

 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into</p><p>abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the

 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 18 
 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of

 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages: 
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice. 
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes.</p><p>
 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
 order to prevent relapse. 
 16 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulin and analogues, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
 insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control 
 as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</p><p> figure 1 a</p><p>figure 1b</p><p>figure 1c</p><p>

 type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the 
 premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m

 18 (expressed as hba1c equivalent) changes from baseline to</p><p>the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58 % of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>

 pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with</p><p>type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure 3).

 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into</p><p>abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similarbetween injection sites and of low intra-
 subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 distribution and elimination</p><p>
 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 18 
 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the

 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.</p><p>elderly very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>

 there are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. however, 
 hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages: 
 mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. it is 
 therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
 or sugary fruit juice. 
 severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
 glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
 appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. glucose must 
 also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
 26 upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse. 
 after an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
 for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: insulin and analogues, fast-acting. atc code: a10ab06</p><p>
 insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
 insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
 insulin.</p><p> the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
 glucose metabolism. insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
 especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. insulin inhibits 
 lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p><p>
 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
 rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
 subcutaneously. when insuline glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
 begin within 10 – 20 minutes. the glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human 
 insulin are equipotent when administered by intravenous route. one unit of insulin glulisine has the 
 same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><p>
 a phase i study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
 insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg, at 
 different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. data indicated that insulin glulisine 
 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial</p><p>glycemic control compared to 
 regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. when given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
 glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
 meal. insulin glulisine administered 
 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).

 type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the 
 premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to</p><p>the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58 % of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>
 absorption and bioavailability</p><p>
 pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, for 
 insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure3). 
 29</p><p> figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 u/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low intra-
 subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 distribution and elimination</p><p>
 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 18 
 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.</p><p>elderly very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p> 
 children and adolescents the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. insulin glulisine was 
 rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar t
 max and cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control 
 than regular human insulin, as in adults (see section 5.1). the glucose excursion (auc</p><p>0-6h) was 641 mg.h.dl

 38 clinical studies</p><p>
 type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 26-week phase iii clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
 insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control 
 as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint.</p><p>comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. no increase in the basal 
 insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.</p><p>
 a 12-week phase iii clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
 insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin 
 glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
 or regular insulin (30-45 minutes).</p><p>
 in the per protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in ghb in the 
 premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.</p><p>
 type 2 diabetes mellitus a 26-week phase iii clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
 before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using nph 
 insulin as basal insulin. the average body mass index (bmi) of patients was 34.55 kg/m
 2. insulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
 (expressed as hba
 1c equivalent) changes from baseline to</p><p>the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
 (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). in this 
 study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with nph insulin immediately 
 prior to injection and 58 % of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were 
 instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.</p><p>
 race and gender in controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position b3 by lysine and the lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.</p><p>
 absorption and bioavailability</p><p>
 pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
 absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
 as high as compared to regular human insulin.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with</p><p> type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg, 
 for insulin glulisine the t
 max was 55 minutes and cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µu/ml compared to a tmax of 82 minutes and a c
 max of 46 ± 1.3 
 µu/ml for regular human insulin. the mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure3). 
 39</p><p> figure 3: pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 u/kg.</p><p>
 in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 u/kg 
 insulin glulisine, the cmax was 91 µu/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µu/ml.</p><p>
 when insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into</p><p>abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
 concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
 abdomen compared to the thigh. absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). the 
 absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low intra-
 subject variability (11%cv).</p><p>
 distribution and elimination</p><p>
 the distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
 administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 18 
 minutes, respectively.</p><p>
 after subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
 insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. in an across study analysis of 
 insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
 apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range).</p><p> special populations</p><p>renal impairment in a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (crcl &gt; 80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, &lt; 30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
 generally maintained. however, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
 impairment.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.</p><p>elderly very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p> 
 children and adolescents the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. insulin glulisine was 
 rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar t
 max and cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control</p></section><section><header>time - hour</header><p>01

 • if optiset is damaged, or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded and a new optiset has to be used</p></section><section><header>general notes</header><p>- the injection button allows checking the actual loaded dose: the button should be pulled out. 
 while holding it out, the last thick bar visible (only the top part can be seen) shows the amount 
 of insulin loaded. if it is difficult to see, the pen may be held at an angle. 
 - 
 the insulin pen must not be dropped or subjected to impact, otherwise, the insulin cartridge in 
 the transparent insulin reservoir may break and the pen will not work. if this happens, a new pen 
 must be used.</p></section><section><header>step 1 check the insulin</header><p>after removing the pen cap, the label on the pen and insulin reservoir should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. the appearance of insulin should also be checked: the insulin solution 
 must be clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and must have a water-like consistency.</p><p>

 the outer and inner needle caps should be removed.</p><p>
 while holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently 
 with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.</p><p>
 then the injection button should be pressed in completely.</p><p>
 if insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. 
 if no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip.</p></section><section><header>step 4  setting and loading the insulin dose</header><p>the dose can be set in steps of 2 units, from a minimum of 2 units to a maximum of 40 units. if a dose greater than 40 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections.</p><p>
 the dosage selector should be turned forward until the dose arrow points to the required dose.</p><p>
 the injection button should be pulled out as far as it will go in order to load the pen.</p></section><section><header>step 5 injecting the insulin dose</header><p>the patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. the needle should be inserted into the skin</p><p>
 the injection button should be pressed in completely. then the injection button should be held down 
 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. this ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected.</p></section><section><header>step 6 removing the needle</header><p>the needle should be removed after each injection and discarded. this will prevent contamination as well as leakage, re-entry of air and potential needle blocks. needles must not be reused.</p><p>
 the pen cap should be replaced on the pen.</p></section><section><header>checking the reservoir for remaining insulin</header><p>the residual insulin scale on the transparent insulin reservoir shows approximately how much insulin remains in the optiset. this scale must not be used to set the insulin dose.</p><p>
 the actual loaded dose should be checked as per “general notes”.in case, the patient is not sure 
 whether enough insulin remains in the reservoir, the optiset should be discarded. 
 example:if the dose has been set to 30 units and injection button can only be pulled out to as far as 12 units, then only 12 units insulin can be injected with this pen. in this example, either the other 18 units 
 43 will have to be injected using a new pen, or the entire 30 units dose will have to be injected using a new pen.</p><p>
 mixing with insulins</p><p>when mixed with nph human insulin, apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. injection should be given immediately after mixing as no data are available regarding the mixtures made up a 
 significant time before injection.</p></section><section><header n="7">7. marketing authorisation holder</header><p>sanofi-aventis deutschland gmbh, brueningstrasse 50, d-65926 frankfurt am main, germany.</p></section><section><header n="8">8. marketing authorisation number(s)</header><p>eu/1/04/285/013-020</p></section><section><header n="9">9. date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation</header><p>27 september 2004</p></section><section><header n="10">10. date of revision of the text</header><p>44</p></section><section><header>annex ii  a. manufacturer of the biological active

 germany</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what apidra is and what it is used for</header><p>apidra is a clear, colourless, aqueous solution for injection containing insulin glulisine. insulin glulisine is produced by recombinant dna technology in 
 escherichia coli microorganism. insulin glulisine has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of action.</p><p>
 each vial contains 10 ml solution (1000 u). packs of 1, 2, 4 and 5 vials of 10 ml are available.</p><p>
 apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus. 
 diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of 
 blood sugar.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use apidra
   do not use apidra if:</header><p>• your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia). follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia. • you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients contained in</p><p>apidra. 
 64</p></section><section><header>take special care with apidra:</header><p>please follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.</p></section><section><header>special patient groups</header><p>impairment of your liver or kidney may reduce your insulin requirements.</p><p>
 there is no adequate clinical information on the use of apidra in children and adolescents.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. your 
 insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. careful control of 
 your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.</p><p>there are no adequate data on the use of apidra in pregnant women.</p></section><section><header>breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p>
 if you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
 your diet.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines:</header><p>your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if you have too low (hypoglycaemia) or too high (hyperglycaemia) blood sugar. please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you 
 might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). you should contact 
 your doctor for advice on driving if you have: 
 - 
 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
 - 
 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>taking/using other medicines:</header><p>some medicines cause the blood sugar level to fall, some cause it to rise, others may have both effects, depending on the situation. in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid too 
 low or too high blood sugar levels. be careful not only when you start another medicine, but also when 
 you stop it.</p><p>
 tell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking, including those you have bought without a 
 prescription. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar to fall include all other medicines for the treatment of 
 diabetes, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used for the treatment of certain heart 
 conditions, high blood pressure or elevated protein/albumin in the urine), disopyramide (used for 
 treatment of certain heart conditions), fluoxetine (used for the treatment of depression), fibrates (used 
 to lower abnormally high blood levels of blood lipids), monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used 
 for the treatment of depression), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (e.g. asprin, used to relieve 
 pain and lower fever) and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p>
 65 medicines that may cause your blood sugar to rise include corticosteroids (&quot;cortisone&quot;), danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in the contraceptive pill 
 used for birth control), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicines (e.g. 
 epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used for the treatment of asthma), thyroid 
 hormones (used for the treatment of malfunction of the thyroid gland), protease inhibitors and atypical 
 antipsychotic medications (e.g; olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take beta-blockers, clonidine or lithium salts or 
 drink alcohol. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by 
 hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (e.g. clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
 weaken the warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemic reaction or suppress them entirely.</p><p>
 if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use apidra</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p><p>
 your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need based on your life-style and the results of 
 blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate 
 or long -acting insulin or a basal insulin or with tablets against high blood sugar.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors to be able to react 
 correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. 
 see the box at the end of section 4 for further information.</p><p>
 apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p>
 your doctor will advise you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. you 
 will feel the effect slightly more quickly if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all 
 insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must 
 be rotated from one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle the vials</header><p>look at the vial before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible particles in it. apidra is a solution and does not require shaking or mixing before use.</p><p>
 apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an 
 insulin pump system.</p></section><section><header>if you have to mix two types of insulin</header><p>apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than nph human insulin.</p><p> 
 if apidra is mixed with nph human insulin, apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. injection 
 should be given immediately after mixing.</p><p>
 66</p></section><section><header>how to handle an infusion pump system</header><p>apidra must never be mixed with diluents or any other insulin when used in a pump.</p><p> 
 before use of apidra in the pump system you should have received comprehensive instructions of this 
 use. in addition, information about any action to be taken in case of illness, too</p><p>high or too low blood 
 sugar or failure of the pump system.</p><p>
 use the type of pump system recommended by your doctor. read and follow the instructions that 
 accompany your insulin infusion pump. follow your doctor’s instructions about the basal infusion rate 
 and the mealtime insulin boluses to be taken. to get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect 
 possible malfunction of the insulin pump, you should measure your blood sugar level regularly.</p><p>
 the infusion set and reservoir should be changed every 48 hours using aseptic technique.</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of pump system failure ?</header><p>you should always have alternative insulin available for injection under the skin in case of pump system failure.</p></section><section><header>if you take more apidra than you should:</header><p>if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>,your blood sugar may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and 
 monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see reference box at the 
 end of section 4.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take apidra:</header><p>if you</p></section><section><header>have missed a dose of apidra</header><p>or if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too low a dose,</header><p>your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. see carefully reference 
 box at the end of section 4 for further recommendationson hyperglycaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, apidra can have side effects.</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) this means that there is not enough sugar in the blood</header><p>if your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. you should be able to recognise when your blood 
 sugar is falling too much, so that you can take the correct actions. please see the box at the end of this 
 section for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its treatment.</p></section><section><header>hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) this means that there is too much sugar in the blood</header><p>if your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you that you could have needed more insulin than you injected. please see the box at the end of this section for further information.</p></section><section><header>eye reactions</header><p>a marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can cause a temporary worsening of your vision. if you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) 
 severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause transient loss of vision.</p><p>67</p></section><section><header>skin side-effects and allergic reactions</header><p>if you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink or thicken (called lipodystrophy). insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. 
 changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.</p><p>
 reactions at the injection site may occur (e.g. reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, itching, 
 hives, swelling or inflammation). they can also spread around the injection site. most minor reactions 
 to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.</p><p>
 systemic allergy, less common but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin which 
 may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction of 
 blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. severe cases of generalised reactions, including anaphylactic 
 reaction, may be life-threatening.</p></section><section><header>tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side-effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects. to prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a 
 side-effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets rapidly worse. 
  if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar level may be too high if, for example: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, e.g. 
 through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less physical exercise, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or if 
 you have an injury, operation, feverish illness or certain other diseases, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 symptoms that may tell you that your blood sugar levels are too high: 
 thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
 pressure, fast heart beat, elevated blood glucose levels and ketone bodies and/or glucose in the urine. 
 stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a 
 serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any such symptoms of hyperglycaemia occur as described above</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar levels may fall too much if, for example: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you take more physical exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from a feverish illness or from another illness, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using 
 other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) are also more likely to occur if :</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 68 - you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (e.g. from the thigh to the upper arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p><p>
 symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast may be, for example: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 the following symptoms indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be less 
 obvious or may be more possibly missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you, due to diabetes, suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (e.g. the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even lose consciousness) before you are 
 aware of the problem. try always to keep familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more 
 frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that might otherwise be 
 overlooked. while you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations 
 (e.g. driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, e.g.</p><p>glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. (measure once as spoonfuls or lumps of sugar or glucose tablets to 
 see how much this means.) caution: please remember that artificial sweeteners and foods with 
 artificial sweeteners (e.g. diet drinks) are of no help in hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (e.g.bread). your 
 doctor or nurse will have discussed this with you.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p></section><section><header>always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.</header><p>tell people in your environment the following: if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood 
 sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
 if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p>

 you stop it.</p><p>
 tell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking, including those you have bought without a 
 prescription. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar to fall include all other medicines for the treatment of 
 diabetes, angiotensine converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used for the treatment of certain heart 
 conditions, high blood pressure or elevated protein/albumin in the urine), disopyramide (used for the 
 treatment of certain heart conditions), fluoxetine (used for the treatment of depression), fibrates (used 
 to lower abnormally high blood levels of blood lipids), monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used 
 for the treatment of depression), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (e.g. aspirin, used to relieve

 if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use apidra</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p><p>
 your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need based on your life-style and the results of 
 blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate 
 or long acting insulin or a basal insulin or with tablets against high blood sugar.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors to be able to react 
 correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. 
 see the box at the end of section 4 for further information.</p><p>
 apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p>
 your doctor will advise you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. you 
 will feel the effect slightly more quickly if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all 
 insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must 
 be rotated from one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle the cartridge</header><p>look at the cartridge before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible particles in it. apidra is a solution and does not require shaking or mixing before use.</p><p>
 the cartridges are to be used in conjunction with an insulin pen such as optipen as recommended in 
 the information provided by the device manufacturer.</p><p> the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
 attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection</p><p>
 before insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen optipen, the cartridge must be stored at room 
 temperature for 1 to 2 hours. air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see 
 instruction for using pen).. empty cartridges must not be refilled.</p><p>
 75 never use optipen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.</p><p>
 to prevent any kind of contamination, the reusable pen should be used only by you.</p><p>
 if the pen malfunctions, the solution may be drawn from the cartridge into a syringe (suitable for an 
 insulin with 100 iu/ml) and injected.</p></section><section><header>if you take more apidra than you should:</header><p>if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too much apidra</header><p>,your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and 
 monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see reference box at the 
 end of section 4.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take apidra:</header><p>if you</p></section><section><header>have missed a dose of apidra</header><p>or if you</p></section><section><header>have injected too low a dose,</header><p>your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. see carefully reference

 sugar is falling too much, so that you can take the correct actions. please see the box at the end of this 
 section for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its treatment.</p></section><section><header>hyperglycaemia (high blood sugars) this means that there is too much sugar in the blood</header><p>if your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you that you could have needed more insulin than you injected. please see the box at the end of this section for further information.</p></section><section><header>eye reactions</header><p>a marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can cause a temporary worsening of your vision. if you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) 
 severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause transient loss of vision.</p></section><section><header>skin side-effects and allergic reactions</header><p>if you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink or thicken (called lipodystrophy). insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. 
 changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.</p><p>
 reactions at the injection site may occur (e.g. reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, itching, 
 hives, swelling or inflammation). they can also spread around the injection site. most minor reactions 
 to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.</p><p>
 systemic allergy, less common but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin which 
 may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction of 
 blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. severe cases of generalised reactions, including anaphylactic 
 reaction, may be life-threatening. 
 76</p></section><section><header>tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side-effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects. to prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a 
 side-effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets rapidly worse. 
  if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar level may be too high if, for example: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, e.g. 
 through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less physical exercise, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or if 
 you have an injury, operation, feverish illness or certain other diseases, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 symptoms that may tell you that your blood sugar levels are too high 
 thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
 pressure, fast heart beat, elevated blood glucose levels and ketone bodies and/or glucose in the urine. 
 stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a 
 serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any such symptoms of hyperglycaemia occur as described above</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar levels may fall too much if, for example: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you take more physical exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from a feverish illness or from another illness, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using 
 other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)are also more likely to occur if :</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (e.g. from the thigh to the upper arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p><p>
 symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast may be, for example: 
 sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 the following symptoms indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in</p><p>
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 77 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be less obvious or may be more possibly missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you, due to diabetes, suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (e.g. the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even lose consciousness) before you are 
 aware of the problem. try always to keep familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more 
 frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that might otherwise be 
 overlooked. while you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations 
 (e.g. driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, e.g.</p><p>glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. (measure once as spoonfuls or lumps of sugar or glucose tablets to 
 see how much this means.) caution: please remember that artificial sweeteners and foods with 
 artificial sweeteners (e.g. diet drinks) are of no help in hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (e.g.bread). your 
 doctor or nurse will have discussed this with you.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p></section><section><header>always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.</header><p>tell people in your environment the following: if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood 
 sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
 if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. storing apidra</header><p>unopened store in a refrigerator (2°c – 8°c).

 85 reactions at the injection site may occur (e.g. reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation). they can also spread around the injection site. most minor reactions 
 to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.</p><p>
 systemic allergy, less common but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin which 
 may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction of 
 blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. severe cases of generalised reactions, including anaphylactic 
 reaction, may be life-threatening.</p></section><section><header>tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side-effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects. to prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a 
 side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets rapidly worse. 
  if your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar level may be too high if, for example: - 
 you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, e.g. 
 through incorrect storage, 
 - 
 you are doing less physical exercise, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or if 
 you have an injury, operation, feverish illness or certain other diseases, 
 - 
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines&quot;).</p><p>
 symptoms that may tell you that your blood sugar levels are too high 
 thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
 pressure, fast heart beat, elevated blood glucose levels and ketone bodies and/or glucose in the urine. 
 stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a 
 serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.</p></section><section><header>test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any such symptoms of hyperglycaemia occur as described above</header><p>. severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.</p></section><section><header>if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia)</header><p>your blood sugar levels may fall too much if, for example: - 
 you inject too much insulin, 
 - 
 you miss meals or delay them, 
 - 
 you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and</p><p> substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are not</p><p> carbohydrates), 
 - 
 you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
 - 
 you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
 - 
 you take more physical exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
 - 
 you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
 - 
 you are recovering from a feverish illness or from another illness, 
 - 
 you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using 
 other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)are also more likely to occur if :</header><p>- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
 - 
 your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
 - 
 you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (e.g. from the thigh to the upper arm), 
 - 
 you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.</p><p>
 86 symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast may be, for example: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
 heartbeat. these symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.</p><p>
 the following symptoms indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be less 
 obvious or may be more possibly missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you, due to diabetes, suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (e.g. the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even lose consciousness) before you are 
 aware of the problem. try always to keep familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more 
 frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that might otherwise be 
 overlooked. while you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations 
 (e.g. driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, e.g.</p><p>glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. (measure once as spoonfuls or lumps of sugar or glucose tablets to 
 see how much this means.) caution: please remember that artificial sweeteners and foods with 
 artificial sweeteners (e.g. diet drinks) are of no help in hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (e.g.bread). your 
 doctor or nurse will have discussed this with you.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p></section><section><header>always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.</header><p>tell people in your environment the following: if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood 
 sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
 if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.

 might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). you should contact 
 your doctor for advice on driving if you have: 
 - 
 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
 - 
 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>taking/using other medicines:</header><p>some medicines cause the blood sugar level to fall, some cause it to rise, others may have both effects, depending on the situation. in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid too 
 low or too high blood sugar levels. be careful not only when you start another medicine, but also when 
 you stop it.</p><p>
 tell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking, including those you have bought without a 
 prescription. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
 action, if any, you need to take.</p><p>
 medicines that may cause your blood sugar to fall include all other medicines for the treatment of 
 diabetes, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used for the treatment of certain heart 
 conditions, high blood pressure or elevated protein/albumin in the urine), disopyramide (used for the 
 treatment of certain heart conditions), fluoxetine (used for the treatment of depression), fibrates (used 
 to lower abnormally high blood levels of blood lipids), monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used 
 for the treatment of depression), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (e.g.aspirin, used to relieve 
 pain and lower fever) and sulfonamide antibiotics. 
 92 medicines that may cause your blood sugar to rise include corticosteroids (&quot;cortisone&quot;), danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in the contraceptive pill 
 used for birth control), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicines (e.g. 
 epinephrine [adrenaline]or salbutamol, terbutaline used for the treatment of asthma), thyroid hormones 
 (used for the treatment of malfunction of the thyroid gland), protease inhibitors and atypical 
 antipsychotic medications (e.g; olanzapine and clozapine).</p><p>
 your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take beta-blockers, clonidine or lithium salts or 
 drink alcohol. pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by 
 hyperglycaemia.</p><p>
 beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (e.g. clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
 weaken the warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemic reaction or suppress them entirely.</p><p>
 if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use apidra</header><p>apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals.</p><p>
 your doctor will determine how much apidra you will need based on your life-style and the results of 
 blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage.</p><p>
 apidra is a short-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an intermediate 
 or</p><p>long acting insulin or a basal insulin or with tablets against high blood sugar.</p><p>
 if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
 doctor.</p><p>
 many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors to be able to react 
 correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. 
 see the box at the end of section 4 for further information.</p><p>
 apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously).</p><p>
 your doctor will advise you in which area of the skin you should inject apidra. apidra can be injected 
 in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. you 
 will feel the effect slightly more quickly if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. as for all 
 insulins, injection sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must 
 be rotated from one injection to the next.</p></section><section><header>how to handle optiset</header><p>optiset is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glulisine.</p></section><section><header>read carefully the &quot; optiset instructions for use&quot; included in this package leaflet. you must use the pen as described in these instructions for use.</header><p>to prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.</p><p>

 vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
 concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
 speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
 tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
 yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness.</p><p>
 95 the first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (&quot;warning symptoms&quot;) may change, be less obvious or may be more possibly missing altogether if: 
 - 
 you are elderly,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you have had diabetes for a long time,</p><p>
 -</p><p> you, due to diabetes, suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy), 
 -</p><p> you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (e.g. the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
 -</p><p> you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
 -</p><p>
 you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, &quot;taking/using other 
 medicines.)</p><p>
 in such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even lose consciousness) before you are 
 aware of the problem. try always to keep familiar with your warning symptoms. if necessary, more 
 frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that might otherwise be 
 overlooked. while you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations 
 (e.g. driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</p></section><section><header>what to do in case of hypoglycaemia?</header><p>1. do not inject insulin. immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, e.g.</p><p>glucose, sugar cubes or a 
 sugar-sweetened beverage. (measure once as spoonfuls or lumps of sugar or glucose tablets to 
 see how much this means.) caution: please remember that artificial sweeteners and foods with 
 artificial sweeteners (e.g. diet drinks) are of no help in hypoglycaemia. 
 2. then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (e.g.bread). your 
 doctor or nurse will have discussed this with you.</p><p>
 3. if the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
 4. speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.</p></section><section><header>always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.</header><p>tell people in your environment the following: if you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood 
 sugar). these injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 it is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
 hypoglycaemia.</p><p>
 carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
 if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. storing apidra</header><p>unopened store in a refrigerator (2°c</p><p>- 8°c).

 press in the injection button completely. a clicking sound can be heard, which will stop when the 
 injection button has been pressed completely. then slowly count to 10 while holding down the 
 104 injection button before withdrawing the needle. this ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected.</p></section><section><header>step 6 removing the needle</header><p>to avoid injuries replace only the outer needle cap onto the needle. unscrew the needle by turning the needle cap dispose of the used needle 
 safely.</p><p>
 remove the needle after each injection and discard it. this will prevent 
 contamination as well as leakage, air and potential needle blocks. needles 
 must not be reused.</p><p>
 now replace the pen cap on the pen.</p></section><section><header>checking the reservoir for remaining insulin</header><p>the residual insulin scale on the transparent insulin reservoir shows approximately how much insulin remains in the optiset. this scale must not be used to set the insulin dose.</p></section><section><header>a</header><p>if the black plunger is at the beginning of the coloured bar, then there are approximately 40 units of insulin available. if the black 
 plunger is at the end of the coloured bar, then there are 
 approximately 20 units of insulin available.</p><p>
 when the level of insulin in the reservoir is low, the injection button allows you to check the dose: 
 - black lines show the number of units. these lines change from thin to thick. 
 - pull out the button completely and hold it out. 
 - the last thick bar visible (only the top part can be seen) shows the amount of insulin loaded. you 
 may need to turn the pen to see the last thick bar</p><p>
 - if it is difficult to see, you can hold the pen at an angle.</p><p>
 - if you are unsure whether you have enough insulin remaining for your next dose, discard this optiset 
 and start a new one.</p><p>
 105 example:</p><p>
 if you have set the dose to 30 units</p></section><section><header>(b)</header><p>and the injection button can only be pulled out to as far as 12 units</p></section><section><header>(c)</header><p>, then only 12 units of insulin can be injected with this pen.</p><p> 
 in this example, either the other 18 units will have to be injected using a 
 new pen, or the entire 30 units dose will have to be injected using a new 
 pen.</p></section><section><header>troubleshooting</header><p>wrong dose selected • if you have pulled out the injection button: never correct the dosage selector while the injection button is pulled out. this
