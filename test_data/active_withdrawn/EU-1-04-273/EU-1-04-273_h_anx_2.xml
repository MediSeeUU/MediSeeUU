 dose adjustment is aimed to reach a therapeutic window (mitotane plasma levels between 14 and 20 
 mg/l) which ensures optimal use of lysodren with acceptable safety. indeed neurologic toxicity has 
 been associated with levels above 20 mg/l and therefore this threshold should not be reached. weaker 
 evidence has suggested that mitotane plasma levels above 14 mg/l may result in enhanced efficacy. 
 thus,mitotane plasma levels should therefore be monitored in order to adjust the lysodren dose and 
 avoiding reaching toxic levels.</p><p>it is advised to perform mitotane plasma assays after each dose change and at frequent (e.g. biweekly) 
 intervals until optimal maintenance dose is reached. in dose readjustments it should be taken into 
 account that adjustments do not produce immediate changes in plasma levels of mitotane (section 4.4). 
 in addition, because of tissue accumulation, monitoring of mitotane plasma level must be pursued 
 regularly (e.g. monthly) once maintenance dose has been reached. 
 regular monitoring (e.g.: bimonthly) of mitotane plasma levels is also necessary after interruption. 
 treatment can be resumed when mitotane plasma levels will be ranged between 14 and 20 mg/l. due 
 to the prolonged half-life, significant serum concentrations may persist for weeks after cessation of 
 therapy.</p><p>adult patients treatment should be started with 2-3 g of lysodren per day and increased stepwise until mitotane plasma level reaches the therapeutic window with acceptable safety, which usually corresponds to a 
 cumulative dose of 75 g .</p><p>the total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to 
 patient’s convenience, and the treatment should be preferably taken during meals (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 in some patients in whom it is urgent to control cushing’s symptoms, the starting dose of lysodren 
 could be as high as 4-6 g daily in divided doses until a cumulative dose of 75 g is reached (in 
 approximately 15 days). in this case, mitotane plasma levels should be closely monitored (e.g. once a 
 week). it is generally not recommended to exceed 6g/day.</p><p> 3if serious adverse reactions occur, such as neurotoxicity, treatment with mitotane may need to be transiently interrupted. in case of mild toxicity, dosage should be reduced until the maximum tolerated 
 dosage is attained.</p><p>
 treatment with lysodren should be continued as long as clinical benefits are observed. if no clinical 
 benefits are observed after 3 months at optimal dose, treatment should be discontinued.</p><p>
 paediatric patients the safety and efficacy of mitotane in patients under the age of 18 years have not been established and, at present only very limited data are available in this age group.</p><p>
 the paediatric dosage of mitotane has not been well characterised but appears equivalent to that of 
 adults: treatment should be initiated at 1.5 to 3.5 g/m
 2/day in children and adolescents and may be reduced after 2 or 3 months according to the mitotane plasma levels. doses should be reduced in case 
 of serious toxicity as in adults (see above).</p><p>
 the total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient’s convenience, and it 
 should be preferably taken during meals.</p><p>liver impairment</p><p>since mitotane is mainly metabolised through the liver, mitotane plasma levels are expected to increase if liver function is impaired. there is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with 
 hepatic impairment, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further 
 data are available, the use of mitotane in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended 
 and, in cases of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised. monitoring of 
 mitotane plasma levels is specially recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 renal impairment there is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with renal impairment, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further data are available, the use of mitotane in 
 patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended and, in cases of mild to moderate renal 
 impairment, caution should be exercised. monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is specially 
 recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 elderly patients there is no experience on the use of mitotane in elderly patients, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further data are available caution should be exercised and 
 frequent monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is highly recommended.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3  contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>
 breast-feeding is contra-indicated while taking mitotane. the prolonged elimination of mitotane from 
 the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be considered (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 lysodren and spironolactone must not be used concomitantly (see section 4.5).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4  special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>before the initiation of the treatment: all possible tumour tissues should be surgically removed from large metastatic masses before mitotane administration is instituted. this is necessary to minimise the 
 possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane.</p><p>shock, severe trauma or infection: mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. exogenous 
 steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not</p><p> 4immediately start to secrete steroids. because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, 
 or other illness occurs. patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet 
 indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate 
 precautionary measures should be taken.</p><p>
 monitoring of plasma levels: mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the lysodren dose. it may be especially recommended in cases where administration of higher starting 
 doses is considered necessary (e.g. in highly symptomatic patients) to reach the desired therapeutic 
 levels more rapidly.. the therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. a dose 
 adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level (see section 4.2) and avoid 
 specific adverse reactions. mitotane plasma levels higher than 20 mg/l may be associated with severe 
 undesirable effects and offer no further benefit in terms of efficacy.</p><p>
 in patients with severe liver disease or severe renal impairment, there are insufficient data to support the use of mitotane (see section 4.2). in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment caution 
 should be exercised and monitoring of liver biochemistry should be performed. in patients with mild 
 or moderate renal impairment caution should be exercised. monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is 
 particularly recommended in patients with liver impairment and/or renal insufficiency (see section 4.2) 
 for whom treatment with lysodren is considered necessary.</p><p>
 mitotane tissue accumulation: mitotane is stored in fat tissues which serve as reservoirs of the active substance which results in a prolonged half-life. consequently, despite a constant dose, mitotane levels 
 may increase. therefore, monitoring of mitotane plasma levels (e.g.: bimonthly) is also necessary after 
 interruption of treatment. in addition, caution should be taken when treating overweight patients as 
 prolonged release of mitotane can occur and close monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is therefore 
 highly recommended.</p><p>
 central nervous system disorders: long-term continuous administration of high doses of mitotane may lead to reversible brain damage and impairment of function. behavioural and neurological 
 assessments should be made at regular intervals especially when mitotane plasma levels exceed 20 
 mg/l (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 risk of adrenal insufficiency: a substantial percentage of patients treated show signs of adrenal insufficiency. therefore steroid replacement may be necessary in these patients. since mitotane 
 increases plasma levels of steroid binding proteins, free cortisol and corticotropin (acth) 
 determinations are necessary for optimal dosing of steroid substitution (see section 4.8).</p><p>women of childbearing potential: women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with mitotane (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 bleeding time: prolonged bleeding time has been reported in patients treated with mitotane and this should be taken into account when surgery is considered (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-like 
 anticoagulants (see section 4.5).</p><p>mitotane is a hepatic enzyme inducer and it should be used with caution in case of concomitant use of 
 medicinal products influenced by hepatic enzyme induction (see section 4.5).</p><p>paediatric population: in children, neuro-psychological retardation can be observed during mitotane treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid 
 impairment linked to mitotane treatment.</p><p>5</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5  interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>spironolactone: mitotane should not be given in combination with spironolactone since this medicinal product may block the action of mitotane (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: mitotane has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of warfarin by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in 
 dosage requirements for warfarin. therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change 
 in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-like 
 anticoagulants.</p><p>
 substances metabolised through cytochrome p450: mitotane has been shown to have an inductive effect on cytochrome p450 enzymes. therefore the plasma concentrations of the products metabolised 
 via cytochrome p450</p><p>may be modified. in the absence of information on the specific p450 isoenzymes 
 involved, caution should be taken when coprescribing active substances metabolised by this route such 
 as, among others, anticonvulsants, rifabutin, rifampicin, griseofulvin and st. john’s wort (
 hypericum perforatum
 ).</p><p>
 medicinal products active on central nervous system: mitotane can give rise to central nervous system undesirable effects at high concentrations (see section 4.8). although no specific information on 
 pharmacodynamic interactions in the central nervous system is available, this should be borne in mind 
 when co-prescribing medicinal products with central nervous system depressant action.</p><p>
 food and oil: data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with food and/or oil enhance absorption (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 hormone binding protein: mitotane has been shown to increase plasma hormone binding protein: this should be taken into account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6  pregnancy and lactation 
  
 pregnancy</header><p>data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate adverse reactions of mitotane on the health of the foetus. animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane. animal studies 
 with similar substances have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). lysodren should be given 
 to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed and if the clinical benefit clearly outweighs any potential 
 risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. the prolonged 
 elimination of mitotane from the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be considered.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>due to the lipophilic nature of mitotane, it is likely to be excreted in breast milk. breastfeeding is contra-indicated while taking mitotane (see section 4.3). a decision should be made whether to 
 discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue lysodren taking into account, on an individual basis, the 
 importance of the treatment to the mother. 
 the prolonged elimination of mitotane from the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be 
 considered.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7  effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>lysodren has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. since sedation, lethargy, vertigo, and other central nervous system undesirable effects can occur, ambulatory patients should be 
 cautioned about driving, operating machines, and other hazardous pursuits requiring mental and 
 physical alertness.</p><p> 6</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8  undesirable effects</header><p>more than 80 % of patients treated with mitotane have shown at least one type of undesirable effect. the main types of adverse reactions, presented in order of decreasing seriousness, consist of the

 • gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequently reported (10 to 100 % of patients) and are reversible when the dose is reduced. some of these effects (anorexia) may constitute the hallmark of 
 initial central nervous system impairment.</p><p>
 • nervous system undesirable effects occur in approximately 40 % of the patients. other undesirable central nervous effects have been reported in literature such as memory defects, aggressiveness, 
 central vestibular syndrome, dysarthria, or parkinson syndrome. serious undesirable effects appear 
 linked to the cumulative exposure to mitotane and are most likely to occur when mitotane plasma 
 levels are at 20 mg/l or above. at high doses and after prolonged utilization, brain function impairment 
 can occur. nervous system undesirable effects appear reversible after cessation of mitotane treatment 
 and decrease in plasma levels (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 • metabolic disorders such as increases in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides are very common.</p><p> 
 • skin rashes which have been reported in 5 to 25 % of the cases do not seem to be dose related.</p><p>
 • leucopenia has been reported in 8 to 12 % of patients. prolonged bleeding time appears a frequent finding (90 percent of the cases): although the exact mechanism of such an effect is unknown and its 
 relation with mitotane or with the underlying disease is uncertain, it should be taken into account when 
 surgery is considered.</p><p>
 • the activity of liver enzymes (gamma-gt, aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) is commonly increased. autoimmune hepatitis has been reported in 7 % of patients with no other information on 
 mechanism. liver enzymes normalize when the mitotane dose is decreased. a case of cholestatic 
 hepatitis has been reported. therefore, the possibility of mitotane-induced liver damage cannot be 
 excluded.</p><p>
 • other isolated undesirable effects have been reported involving: the eye (visual impairment, maculopathy, vision blurred, diplopia, lens opacity, retinal toxicity); the renal and urinary system 
 (haematuria, haemorrhagic cystitis, proteinuria); cardiovascular system (hypertension, or orthostatic 
 hypotension, and flushing); and some miscellaneous effects including generalized aching; 
 hyperpyrexia; decreased plasma uric acid.</p><p>
 • because of its adrenolytic activity and its action on cortisol metabolism, mitotane treatment induces a state of functional adrenal insufficiency, which necessitates hormone supplementation. since 
 mitotane increases plasma level of steroid binding proteins, free cortisol and acth determinations are 
 necessary for optimal dosing of steroid substitution (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in paediatric patients: nervous system disorders: neuro-psychological retardation may be observed during mitotane 
 treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid 
 impairment linked to mitotane treatment.</p><p>
 hypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed during mitotane treatment.</p><p> 8</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9  overdose</header><p>mitotane overdose may lead to central nervous system impairment especially if mitotane plasma levels are above 20 mg/l. no proven antidotes have been established for mitotane overdose. the patient 
 should be followed closely, taking into account that impairment is reversible but given the long half-
 life and the lipophilic nature of mitotane it may take weeks to return to normal. other effects should be 
 treated symptomatically. because of its lipophilic nature, mitotane is not likely to be dialysable.</p><p>it is recommended to increase frequency of mitotane plasma level monitoring (e.g. biweekly) in 
 patients at risk of overdose (e.g. in case of renal or hepatic impairment, obese patients or patients with 
 a recent weight loss).</p></section><section><header n="5">5.  pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents. atc code: l01xx23</p><p>
 mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic active substance, although it can cause adrenal inhibition, apparently 
 without cellular destruction. its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown. data are available to 
 suggest that mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing 
 the adrenal cortex. the administration of mitotane alters the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol in 
 man, leading to a reduction in measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroids, even though plasma levels of 
 corticosteroids do not fall. mitotane apparently causes increased formation of 6-beta-hydroxyl 
 cholesterol.</p><p>
 mitotane has not been studied in a clinical therapeutic program. available clinical information comes 
 mainly from published data in patients with inoperable or metastatic adrenal carcinoma. in terms of 
 overall survival, four studies conclude that mitotane treatment does not increase the survival rate 
 whereas five find an increase in the survival rate. among the latter, three studies find such an increase 
 only in patients in whom mitotane plasma is above 14 mg/l. in terms of total or partial tumour and/or 
 metastasis regression, eleven studies have shown some degree of improvement and sometimes 
 occasional prolonged remissions. however, in several studies, the objective criteria for evaluating 
 tumour response are missing or not reported. there are nevertheless some studies which provide 
 accurate information on tumour regression or disappearance and demonstrate that the threshold of 14 
 mg/l appears necessary to induce an objective tumour regression. in addition, mitotane induces a state 
 of adrenal insufficiency which leads to the disappearance of cushing syndrome in patients with 
 secreting adrenal carcinoma and necessitates substitution hormonotherapy.</p><p>paediatric population: clinical information comes mainly from a large retrospective trial in children (median age, 4 years) who had an unresectable primary tumour or who presented a tumour recurrence 
 or a metastasic disease; most of the children (75%) presented with endocrine symptoms. 
 mitotane was given alone or combined with chemotherapy with various agents. overall, the disease-
 free interval was 7 months (2 to 16 months). there were recurrences in 40% of children; the survival 
 rate at 5 years was 49%.</p><p>
 the observed undesirable effects were almost comparable to those in adults; however, neuro-
 psychological retardation, hypothyroidism and growth retardation can also be observed.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2  pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in a study performed in patients with adrenal carcinoma treated with 2 to 3 g daily of mitotane, a highly significant correlation was found between plasma mitotane concentration and the total mitotane 
 dose. the target plasma mitotane concentration (14 mg/l) was reached in all patients within 3 to 5 
 months and the total lysodren dose ranged between 283 and 387 g x days of treatment (median value: 
 363 g x days of treatment). the threshold of 20 mg/l was reached for cumulative amounts of mitotane</p><p> 9of approximately 500 g. in another study, 3 patients with adrenal carcinoma received lysodren according to a precise protocol allowing fast introduction of a high dose if the product was well 
 tolerated: 3 g (as 3 intakes) on day 1, 4.5 g on day 2, 6 g on day 3, 7.5 g on day 4 and 9 g on day 5. 
 this dose of lysodren was continued or decreased in function of side effects and plasma mitotane 
 levels. there was a positive linear correlation between the cumulative dose of lysodren and the 
 plasma levels of mitotane. in two of the 3 patients, plasma levels of more than 14 mg/l were achieved 
 within 15 days and in one of them levels above 20 mg/l were achieved within approximately 30 days. 
 in addition, in both studies, in some patients, the plasma mitotane levels continued to rise despite 
 maintenance or a decrease of the daily dose of mitotane.</p><p>
 administration of lysodren tablets with food increased absorption (see section 4.2), although no 
 quantitative measure of relative bioavailability was made.</p><p>
 autopsy data from patients show that mitotane is found in most tissues of the body, with fat as the 
 primary site of storage.</p><p>
 metabolism studies in man have identified the corresponding acid, 
 o,p’-dda, as the major circulating metabolite, together with smaller quantities of the 
 o,p’-dde analogue of mitotane. no unchanged mitotane has been found in bile or in urine, where 
 o,p’-dda predominates, together with several of its hydroxylated derivatives.</p><p>
 after intravenous administration, 25% of the dose was excreted as metabolite within 24 hours. 
 following discontinuation of mitotane treatment, it is slowly released from storage sites in fat, leading 
 to reported terminal plasma half-lives ranging from 18 to 159 days.</p><p>
 for induction with cytochrome p450, see section 4.5.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3  preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data on the general toxicity of mitotane is limited. reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with mitotane. however, ddt and other polychlorinated biphenyl analogues are 
 recognised to have deleterious effects on fertility, pregnancy and development, and mitotane could be 
 expected to share these properties. the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of mitotane have not been 
 investigated.</p></section><section><header n="6">6.  pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1  list of excipients</header><p>maize starch</p><p>microcrystalline cellulose (e 460)

 recurrent malignant tumour of adrenal glands.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you take lysodren

 -</p><p>if you are breast-feeding (see “breast-feeding”) 
 -</p><p>if you are currently treated with spironolactone (a medicine often used in the treatment of cardiac, 
 hepatic or renal diseases). you should check with your doctor whether or not you are taking 
 spironolactone (see &quot;taking other medicines&quot;).</p></section><section><header>take special care with lysodren</header><p>due to the effects of lysodren, your doctor may prescribe you some hormonal treatment (steroids) while you are taking lysodren.</p><p>

 lysodren should not be given in combination with spironolactone (a medicine often used in the 
 treatment of cardiac, hepatic or renal diseases (see “do not take lysodren”).</p><p>
 lysodren weakens the effects of a medicine named warfarin (this medicine is a blood thinner, a 
 medicine used to prevent blood clots). therefore, you should always tell your doctor if you take a 
 blood thinner.</p><p>
 lysodren could interfere with several other medicines such as:</p><p>
 -</p><p>medicines used in the treatment of epilepsy (e.g. anticonvulsants). 
 -</p><p>medicines used in the treatment of tuberculosis (e.g. rifabutin or rifampicin). 
 -</p><p>medicines used in the treatment of fungal infections (e.g. griseofulvin)</p><p>
 lysodren may also interfere with an herbal remedy named st. john’s wort (
 hypericum perforatum).</p></section><section><header>taking lysodren with food and drink</header><p>lysodren should be preferably taken during meals.</p><p>
 taking lysodren with food and/or oil could enhance absorption.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding:</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy</header><p>in case of pregnancy, your doctor may decide to modify your treatment, as lysodren may harm the foetus. therefore, always tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</p><p>
 if you are a woman who may become pregnant, you should use effective contraception during 
 treatment with lysodren. this is also the case once the treatment is stopped. lysodren is eliminated 
 very slowly; it may take several months before it disappears from your body. therefore, after 
 lysodren is stopped, you should ask your doctor about the use of an effective contraception.</p></section><section><header>breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</p><p> 
 do not take lysodren while breast-feeding your child. lysodren is likely to be found in breast milk.</p><p>
 therefore, always tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your 
 child (see “do not take lysodren”). your doctor will decide to either stop lysodren or stop breast-
 feeding.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>lysodren has a major influence on your ability to drive and use machines. therefore, you should ask your doctor about driving, if you have to use machines, or if you are doing some potentially dangerous 
 activities which require mental and physical alertness.</p><p> 21</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to take lysodren

 lysodren you have in your blood.</p><p>

 effects (especially in the central nervous system).</p><p>

 the size of the child. you may administer lysodren to the child into two or three divided doses at your 
 convenience.</p></section><section><header>if you take more lysodren than you should</header><p>please tell your doctor immediately if you have taken accidentally more lysodren than you should or if a child swallows some and if you or the child experience undesirable effects (central nervous system
