 emea 2005</header></section><section><header>scientific discussion</header><p>this module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of lysodren. for information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.</p></section><section><header n="1">1. introduction</header><p>malignant neoplasms of the adrenal cortex are rare; they account for 0.05 to 0.2 per cent of all cancers, and show a bimodal age distribution, with the first peak occurring before the age of 5 years and the 
 second in the fourth to fifth decade. there is a female predominance, accounting for 55 to 85 per cent 
 of the cases, particularly among functional tumours. men with adrenal cortical carcinoma tend to be 
 older than women (third national cancer survey, national cancer institute, 1975).</p><p>
 approximately 60 percent of patients have a functional adrenal cortical carcinoma, defined by the 
 existence of signs of excess adrenal hormone production. among functional tumours, cushing’s 
 syndrome is evidenced in half of the patients and virilization in one third of them, whereas 
 hyperaldosteronism, feminisation or the combination of cushing’s syndrome and virilization account 
 for a minority of patients. nearly half of adult carcinomas are non-functional, and these patients 
 present clinically with abdominal or flank pain or as an adrenal mass incidentally discovered. 
 metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, or bone may cause symptoms before the primary diagnosis is 
 made.</p><p>
 the staging criteria of adrenal cortical carcinoma allow identifying 4 stages (grossman 2002, flack et 
 al.</p><p>1997, (liou and kay 2000), which actually correspond to 3 stages of the disease (ng and libertino 2003): local disease (stages i and ii), regional disease (stage iii), and advanced disease (stage iv). 
 about 40% of patients have stage iv disease at diagnosis, and the incidences of stage i, ii and iii is 
 20% each.</p><p>
 surgical resection is the only therapy that has consistently shown to prolong survival and be curative 
 in some cases, particularly if disease is detected at early stages and local or distant metastases are 
 absent (&lt; 50% of patients). radical excision with en bloc resection is the procedure of choice 
 (ipsilateral adrenalectomy with/without nephrectomy and/or splenectomy). the recurrence rate after 
 complete resection is 35-85%, and no adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy immunotherapy 
 or hormonal treatment) has demonstrated to be beneficial.</p><p>
 resectable recurrences are usually operated on, and a number of patients remain disease-free 
 thereafter. the role of surgery when the tumours cannot be completely excised is more controversial. 
 a drug therapy is often administered to patients whose tumour is unresectable at presentation or at 
 relapse and radiotherapy is only indicated as palliative treatment for patients with bone metastases. 
 mitotane is the most commonly prescribed medicinal product. other chemotherapeutic agents 
 frequently used are cisplatin, etoposide or doxorubicin (the list is not exhaustive). these are usually 
 used in combination regimens (cisplatin-etoposide, cisplatin-doxorubicin-5-fu, ...) and are able to 
 induce short lived objective responses in about 20-30% of patients. their toxicity is however 
 remarkable in this palliative setting and their impact in disease progression, survival or quality on life 
 remain unproven.</p><p>
 the prognosis of adrenal cortical carcinoma tumours is generally poor in adults and somehow better in 
 children. in a recent review of seven large series, the mean survival was 18 months. most series 
 showed no statistically significant differences based on patients’ age, gender or tumour functional 
 status. however, stage was an important prognostic predictor. for stages i to iv tumours, approximate 
 5-year survival was 30-45%, 12.5-57%, 5-18% and 0%, respectively. surgical resection was the only 
 therapy that significantly prolonged survival, particularly when disease was detected at stages i and ii. 
 median survival in patients with unresectable tumours was 3 to 9 months, whereas after complete 
 resection median survival was 13 to 28 months.</p><p>2/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 mitotane or o,p’-ddd (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane), is an isomer of ddd, an insecticide analogue of ddt, which was shown to produce adrenal atrophy in dogs. by 
 causing alterations in the mitochondrial function and blocking adrenal steroid 11-
 β-hydroxylation and altering the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol and androgens, mitotane acts as an adrenolytic agent. 
 these observations led to the discovery of the potential value of mitotane in the treatment of adrenal 
 cortical carcinoma.</p><p>
 surgery seems to be the preferred option of treatment of adrenal carcinoma (whenever possible). 
 nevertheless, medical treatment may be necessary if case of failure of surgical intervention, when it is 
 impossible or in case of relapse. in these circumstances, mitotane appears to be the most commonly 
 used treatment. nowadays, there is no authorised drug therapy for the treatment of adrenocortical 
 carcinoma.</p><p>
 on 12 june 2002, mitotane was granted an orphan designation by the european commission, based on 
 the low prevalence of the disease (0.1 in 10,000 persons, corresponding to less than 4000 cases in the 
 european union), where the indication is pursued (adrenal carcinoma).</p></section><section><header>well-established medicinal use</header><p>this marketing authorisation application for lysodren was a full marketing authorisation application. all non-clinical and clinical documentation presented in modules 4 and 5 for this 
 application, consisted of publications. the applicant did not provide data from own tests. the 
 submission of bibliographical non-clinical and clinical data is justified with reference to article 
 10(1)(a)(ii) of directive 2001/83/ec, as amended and to part ii.1 of annex i to directive 2001/83/ec, 
 as amended by directive 2003/63/ec. these require that the applicant demonstrates that the 
 constituent of the medicinal product has a well-established medicinal use, with recognised efficacy 
 and an acceptable level of safety.</p><p>
 the claim of ‘well-established medicinal use’ of mitotane has been based on the time over which the 
 substance has been used, on quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, the degree of scientific 
 interest in the use of the substance, and the coherence of scientific assessments. the applicant has 
 submitted bibliographical data covering all aspects of the safety and efficacy assessment and which 
 reflect information available at that time. at the time when the marketing authorisation application 
 for lysodren was submitted no epidemiological study assessing the efficacy or safety profile of this 
 product had been published. the applicant addressed, whenever possible, the relevance of data 
 submitted concerning products or formulations different from the product (lysodren) intended to be 
 authorised in the community. the applicant submitted a five years periodic safety update report 
 (for the third countries where the product is authorised covering the period from 8 july 1997 to 7 july 
 2002).</p></section><section><header>overview of the development of mitotane</header><p>mitotane was shown to produce adrenal atrophy in dogs in 1948. mitotane has been used an an adrenolytic agent for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma since 1960 (bergenstal, hertz et al. 
 1960). lysodren is currently approved in seven countries and marketed in six non-eu countries (these 
 countries are brazil, canada, hong kong, malaysia, south korea and united states of america). 
 mitotane is available in australia and new zealand to individual patients under a sas (special access 
 scheme).</p><p>
 mitotane was granted by the european commission on 12 june 2002 an orphan designation in the eu, 
 based on the low prevalence of the adrenal carcinoma (0.1 in 10,000 persons, corresponding to less 
 than 4000 cases in the european union), where the indication is pursued.</p></section><section><header>time over which mitotane has been used in the community</header><p>the extent and the period over which mitotane was used in the community is documented by the publication of clinical reports (on uncontrolled and open series of patients) treated with the product for

 responses, the efficacy of mitotane in bringing about objective tumor regression has been explored in 
 large retrospective studies conducted for some of them in eu countries. since the beginning of the 
 nineties, the studies published in the scientific literature included large series of patients treated by 
 mitotane. in france, luton et al. studied the benefit of mitotane administration in 105 patients (75 
 female and 30 male; mean age, 46 years) with adrenocortical carcinoma who were referred to this</p><p>6/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 hospital between 1963 and 1987 (luton, cerdas et al. 1990). in italy, the survival rate of forty-five patients treated or not with adjuvant with mitotane was studied between 1978 and 1995. in the 
 netherlands, the use is documented in a large series of patients for a period of time exceeding forty 
 years (haak, hermans et al. 1994). mitotane has been used in sweden for more than 20 years (khan, 
 imam et al. 2000) and in the united kingdom for approximately 30 years.</p><p>
 most of these articles do not mention the exact trade name of the product used in the studies. however, 
 lysodren is explicitly quoted in four of the studies (haak, hermans et al. 1994; barzon, fallo et al. 
 1997; khan, imam et al. 2000; terzolo, pia et al. 2000). none of these articles explain the method of 
 access by which the product was made available to the patients.</p><p>
 bristol myers squibb sent a letter to the applicant indicating that no change has been made to the 
 lysodren formulation since july 1970.</p><p>
 the applicant has been able to get more information on the formulation used in the clinical trials after 
 contacting the authors of the articles:</p><p>
 - 
 all investigators from the usa have used lysodren, which is the only commercially available 
 formulation in this country, and references reviewed in the present review encompass 
 approximately 500 patients. 
 - 
 in the eu, papers corresponding to the following references of the present application have used 
 lysodren with certainty (personal confirmation by the authors to the applicant, or indication in 
 the publication): 
 oilias et al. in greece. oterzolo et al. and beruti et al. in italy;</p><p>obarzon et al. in italy oahlman et al . in sweden; okhan et al. in sweden; ohaak et al. in the netherlands;</p><p>
 finally, five years periodic safety update report (psur) submitted to the third countries were 
 lysodren is authorised and covering the period from 8 july 1997 until 7 july 2002 was included in the 
 marketing authorisation application for lysodren. this psur contained spontaneous adverse drug 
 reaction reports observed in the eu confirming that mitotane is currently used in the eu for the 
 treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma.</p><p>
 in conclusion, the applicant mentioned that the product was currently used and prescribed in 
 compassionate use programmes in several eu member states. the applicant did not provide other 
 evidence than the articles published in the scientific literature (i.e. it is mentioned in the articles 
 published in france that mitotane was provided by the pharmacie centrale des hôpitaux de paris 
 which belonged to the assistance publique not to a pharmaceutical company) and the periodic safety 
 update report to support this claim but these elements of information confirm the existence of a 
 compassionate use in the eu. some cpmp members confirmed the existence of compassionate use 
 programmes supervised by their national competent authority during the discussions at the cpmp.</p></section><section><header>quantitative aspects of the use of mitotane</header><p>adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor, its true incidence was estimated to be approximately between 0.5 and 2 cases per million per year according to the third national cancer survey conducted 
 in 1975 (national cancer institute 1975, finnish cancer registry and national board of health and 
 welfare, the cancer registry: cancer incidence in sweden 1984 (the last two references are quoted in 
 barzon, fallo et al. 1997). therefore, assuming an annual incidence of a maximum of 2 cases/million 
 persons per year, in the european union (350 million inhabitants) an estimated 700 new patients per 
 year may potentially benefit from a treatment with mitotane.</p><p>
 based on this incidence and taking into account all stages of the disease, considering that the 5 years 
 and 10 years survival of the patients are respectively 35 and 20% (pommier and brennan 1992), the</p><p>7/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 calculated prevalence of adrenal cortical carcinoma can be estimated to a maximum of 0.1 cases per 10,000 inhabitants. extrapolating to the european union population (377 million in 2001), the 
 estimated number of patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma is approximately equal to 3,770 patients.</p><p>
 the calculation of the estimate of the number of patients treated with mitotane in the eu was based on 
 two sources of information: the articles published in the scientific literature and the worldwide sales 
 figures. this estimate has to be put into perspective with the incidence and prevalence of the disease. 
 none of these sources can provide an exact estimate of the number of patients who benefited from a 
 treatment with mitotane. the number of patients reported in the articles probably suffers from an 
 underestimation of the real number of patients treated with the product; in addition these worldwide 
 sales figure only concern lysodren (and no other mitotane containing medicinal products). the 
 estimate based on the sales figures is made under some assumptions concerning the dose administered 
 to the patients and the duration of treatment, both dose and duration and treatment are not known with 
 certainty.</p><p>
 the applicant estimated that approximately 665 patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma were reported 
 in the literature and were treated with mitotane since 1959 (i.e. more than 10 years) in the european 
 union. the five years periodic safety update report covering the period from 8 july 1997 until 
 7 july 2002 contained an estimate of the exposure to mitotane in the eu based on the bulk of 
 worldwide sales. assuming that all patients are adults with normal hepatic function receiving mitotane 
 for inoperable adrenal cortical carcinoma, and that each patient received 10 grams daily for 365 days, 
 the applicant estimated that slightly more than 1,700 patients benefited from a treatment with mitotane 
 a year in the united states of america and canada (lysodren is authorised in these two countries) over 
 the period covered by the psur. from the previous five years periodic safety update report covering 
 the period from 1992 until 1997, the applicant estimated that 991 patients were treated with mitotane a 
 year in the usa and in canada. using the same bulk worldwide sales and based on the estimates of the 
 number of patients treated in the usa and in canada, the applicant estimated that more than 2,500 
 patients might have benefited from a one-year treatment by mitotane in the last 10 years in the eu.</p><p>
 in conclusion, the data published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature demonstrates that an 
 estimated 665 patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated with mitotane since 1959 (i.e. 
 more than ten years) in the european union. the sales figures included in the psur showed that 
 approximately 250 patients-year may benefit from a treatment with lysodren in the community. the 
 incidence and prevalence of the disease in the eu suggest that the estimated number of patients who 
 may potentially benefit from a treatment with mitotane in the eu is approximately 700 new patients 
 per year.</p></section><section><header>scientific interest</header><p>a bibliographical research made in medline on the criteria “mitotane”, “o,p’-ddd” combined with “adrenocortical carcinoma” showed that 529 and 549 articles referencing mitotane or o,p’ ddd had 
 been listed in this database. the combination of two criteria “mitotane” or “o,p’-ddd” with 
 “adrenocortical carcinoma” showed that 98 and 118 articles containing these key words were listed in 
 the database. these articles illustrate that over the past forty years, several teams of worldwide medical 
 researchers tried to define the place of mitotane (alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic 
 agents) in the treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma, to assess its efficacy on the control of hormonal 
 secretion and its possible effect on overall survival. finally, during the past 10 years some teams tried 
 to establish a possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relation for mitotane. the clinical relevance 
 of the results of the data published in the literature and its implications on the use of mitotane in the 
 treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma are further discussed in the clinical efficacy and safety parts of 
 this report.</p></section><section><header>coherence of scientific assessments</header><p>the coherence of scientific assessment is further discussed in the clinical efficacy/clinical safety sections of this report. as stated above, the exact indication of mitotane in the treatment of adrenal 
 cortical carcinoma has to be defined. however, since its first use in the treatment of patients with</p><p>8/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 adrenal cortical carcinoma in 1960 the published literature consistently insisted on the potential therapeutic interest of this product in the treatment of patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma in adults 
 (see for example (luton, cerdas et al. 1990; pommier and brennan 1992; haak, hermans et al. 1994; 
 barzon, fallo et al. 1997; khorram-manesh, ahlman et al. 1998; kasperlik-zaluska 2000; terzolo, pia 
 et al. 2000; baudin, pellegriti et al. 2001; favia, lumachi et al. 2001), or in children (teinturier, 
 pauchard et al. 1999; ciftci, senocak et al. 2001).</p></section><section><header>discussion on ‘well-established medicinal use’</header><p>the applicant submitted an application in which all the contents of the dossier relating to safety and efficacy of the product were bibliographical. in addition, the applicant demonstrated that the use of 
 mitotane is well established in the medical practice in a known indication (i.e. adrenocortical 
 carcinoma) with a strength and a pharmaceutical form in which mitotane has always been used, in view 
 of the period of time over which it has been used and the information publicly available about its safety 
 and efficacy (i.e. since 1960). 
 the applicant has submitted the relevant literature covering all aspects of the safety and efficacy 
 assessment, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature on 
 the experience with mitotane. the use of bibliographic reference to the experience with mitotane to 
 support the efficacy and safety profile has been justified satisfactorily. the relevance of the data 
 submitted which concern a product different from lysodren has been addressed satisfactorily.</p><p>
 systematic use of mitotane in the community has been documented for more than ten years, starting 
 in 1960. ever since, patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated on compassionate use 
 programmes and in clinical trials trying to establish the clinical benefit that may be obtained with 
 mitotane and the existence of a possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relation with this product.</p><p>
 the exact indication of mitotane in the treatment of this disease has to be defined. although the 
 studies published with mitotane were most of the time open, non-randomised, uncontrolled studies 
 including at best a limited number of patients (50-100), the articles published since the sixties, and 
 more recent works published in the nineties, established that mitotane is clinically beneficial for the 
 patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma.</p><p>
 in conclusion, mitotane (the active substance contained in lysodren) has a well established medicinal 
 use, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety (see the scientific discussion included 
 in the non-clinical and clinical parts of this report), as demonstrated by the time over which the 
 substance has been used, quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, the degree of scientific 
 interest in the use of the substance, and the coherence of scientific assessments.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
  composition</header><p>this product is presented in the form of tablets containing 500mg of the active substance mitotane, in a matrix of microcrystalline cellulose and corn starch, with polyethylene glycol 3350 and colloidal 
 silicon dioxide as lubricant and glidant respectively. the tablets are packed in a primary container of 
 hdpe with a metal closure.</p></section><section><header>active substance</header><p>the chemical name of mitotane is 1-chloro-2-[2,2-dicloro-1-(4-chlorophenil)ethyl]benzene. it is a white to off-white crystalline powder, having a slight, aromatic odour. it is practically insoluble in 
 water, soluble in alcohol, ether, hexane and in fixed oils and fats.</p><p>these properties underline the effect 
 of the particle size and physical form on the dissolution and hence the bioavailability of the active 
 substance and therefore need to be tightly controlled to ensure the clinical safety and efficacy of the 
 medicinal product. mitotane is an‘established’ substance which is the subject of a monograph in the 
 usp, and full information has been provided in the form of an edmf from the manufacturer.</p><p>9/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 manufacture synthesis is a simple process starting from 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, chloroform and mono-chlorobenzene. the manufacturing process is carried out in 5 steps (three of them include chemical 
 reactions and the other two correspond to recrystallizations). 
 the chemical structure has been briefly characterised by spectroscopic means especially gc-ms, 
 considered sufficient in this case, as it is monographed in the usp.</p><p>
 minimal toxicology data permit the qualification of the impurities and residual solvents specified at 
 the limits proposed. however, the applicant has justified the impurity levels from a safety point of 
 view and taking into account the therapeutic indication of the product and its use in europe for more 
 than 30 years, it may be considered in general that there are no additional safety concerns arising from 
 impurities in the use of mitotane for the therapeutic indication proposed.</p><p>
 specification the active substance specification includes relevant tests for identity (ir, uv), assay (gc), dimeric related substance (hplc), residual solvents etc. the routine tests are performed in accordance with 
 the usp monograph. the additional in house analytical methods have been adequately validated. 
 however, the omission of relevant tests for relevant physical properties particularly particle sizewas 
 noted and recommended to be resolved after the opinion as a followup measure.</p></section><section><header>other ingredients</header><p>all materials used are of non-animal origin and comply with eur. ph requirements. magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
 the tablets are packaged in white high-density polyethylene (hpde) bottle closed with a screw metal 
 closure system.</p></section><section><header>stability</header><p>long term and accelerated stability studies have been carried out according to the cpmp/qwp/556/96 guideline. four batches have been studied. taking into account the results submitted, it could be 
 concluded that no significant changes have occurred in the active substance content.</p><p>
 however, there is some doubt as to whether the analytical methods can be regarded as stability 
 indicating. the proposed re-test period of 3 years is not acceptable since degradation products have 
 not been controlled, and hence the active substance should be tested immediately before use in the 
 manufacturing of the finished product, until such time as a validated retest period can be agreed.</p></section><section><header>medicinal product</header><p>product development and finished product limited data have been provided for the development pharmaceutics. however this could be accepted based on the fact that the medicinal product is well known and has been marketed in the eu for many 
 years. 
 the manufacturing process for the finished product is a conventional process consisting of the 
 following steps: milling of the drug susbstance and blending it with microcrystalline cellulose. milling 
 and blending of the mixture with the remaining ingredients, slugging, screening, blending of the slugs 
 and finally compressing. the process is monitored by appropriate in process controls.</p><p>the process validation of lysodren tablets was performed on three production batches. the validation 
 data concern critical parameters like the blending time and the tabletting operation. the results 
 obtained confirm the suitability of the process to produce a product of consistent quality that meets the

 however, according to ich guidelines since the active substance is practically insoluble in water the</p><p>10/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 relationship between disintegration and dissolution needs to be further investigated to guarantee the release of the active substance. this issue will be addressed as a follow up commitment. 
 batch analysis data from six stability and one commercial scale batches of the finished product have 
 been provided. all batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification.</p><p>
 stability of the product three batches of the finished product in the proposed for marketing packaging have been placed under stability studies in long term (25ºc, 60%rh) and accelerated conditions (40ºc, 75%rh) according to 
 ich guidelines for up to two years. results from supportive stability studies on three batches 
 packaged in glass bottles and stored in long term conditions have also been presented.</p><p>
 the tests used to evaluate the product at the end of shelf life were the routine ones (except uniformity 
 of content and identification) and two new tests: loss on drying and impurities determination. all 
 methods employed were stability indicating. 
 all the results from the stability and supportive batches were within specifications. based on the 
 results of the above-mentioned studies it has been concluded that the proposed shelf life for the 
 commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the spc is acceptable.</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>despite the fact that this is an established substance described in the usp, some deficiencies in the quality dossier have been identified at the time of the cpmp opinion. the most important is perhaps 
 the absence of physical characterisation and routine control of such a poorly soluble active substance. 
 it may be unethical to perform bioavailability studies in humans with such a toxic substance in order 
 to confirm 
 in vitro – in vivo correlations. on the other hand, this makes it all the more necessary to fully control as many 
 in vitro characteristics as possible, especially the physical ones, by means of relevant and validated methods. 
 a number of other minor quality issues were also not resolved at the time of the opinion.</p><p>
 on balance, the cpmp has reached their opinion on the basis of an ‘overall’ benefit/risk balance, 
 taking into account the clinical usefulness of this product in the proposed indication, and accepting 
 that some quality deficiencies have not been fully resolved at the time of the opinion. consequently 
 the applicant has been required to give a commitment to resolve these outstanding quality concerns 
 within a defined timeframe, as post-opinion followup measures.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. toxico-pharmacologocial aspects 
  introduction</header><p>lysodren contains the active substance mitotane or o,p’-ddd (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane). mitotane is an isomer of an insecticide, ddt or 1,1,1,-trichloro-
 2,2-bis(4chorophenyl)ethane (p,p’-ddd). the potential of mitotane to affect the adrenals was first 
 noted by nelson and woodard (1948); these authors, working with technical grade ddd, observed 
 adrenocortical atrophy in dogs. subsequent studies showed that the active component was o,p’-ddd, 
 an impurity in technical grade product.</p></section><section><header>pharmacology</header><p>since these initial observations, several publications confirm the adrenalytic activity of mitotane, particularly in dogs. histological examination showed a disruption of normal cellular structure and 
 arrangement in the innermost zones of the adrenal cortex (zonas fasciculata and reticularis). the 
 earliest observable ultrastructural change in the dog adrenal cortex was the swelling, dissolution and 
 rupture of mitochondria in the zona fasciculata-reticularis area. these changes were correlated with a 
 reduction of the adrenal output of 17-hydroxy steroid and an inhibition of acth-induced steroid 
 production.</p><p>11/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 studies on the mechanism underlying this action on the adrenals have suggested metabolism within the adrenals to generate reactive intermediates, which are capable of covalent binding to mitochondrial 
 macromolecules. thus, 
 in vitro studies with bovine adrenal cortex homogenates, as well as those of dog, rat and human, identified 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (o,p’-dda) as a metabolite of 
 mitotane. it was demonstrated that the mitochondrial fraction of dog adrenal cortex homogenates were 
 responsible for the metabolism of mitotane and generation of o,p’-dda. moreover, metabolism of 
 mitotane in adrenal mitochondria was seen to correlate with the generation of covalent binding 
 species. by correlating the generation of o,p’-dda and covalent binding by adrenal homogenates 
 across different species with the recognized sensitivity of these species to the adrenolytic effect of 
 mitotane and comparing the generation of the corresponding dda isomers from mitotane and its m,p’ 
 and p,p’ isomers, data emerged consistent with and acyl chloride being the reactive intermediate, 
 leading to both the dda metabolite and binding to adrenal cortical bionucleophiles.</p><p>
 in addition to these effects within the adrenal gland, mitotane also induces enzymes involved in the 
 metabolism of drugs that could affect the levels of circulating steroids. enhanced cortisol metabolism 
 has also been reported in rats and guinea - pigs.</p><p>
 studies with well-characterised cell lines as regards genotype and biochemistry are limited. this lack 
 of data can be justified taking into account the clinical experience.</p><p>
 in vivo studies to assess the activity of mitotane in different tumour cell lines as requested in the guideline cpmp/swp/997/96 (note for guidance on the pre-clinical evaluation of anticancer 
 medicinal products) have not been conducted. the lack of such data can be justified taking into 
 account the clinical experience gathered with this product over the past 30/40 years.</p></section><section><header>primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo)</header><p>hart et al (1973) studied the effects in dogs of single intravenous doses of 60 mg/kg of mitotane (o,p’-ddd) and its 
 m,p’- and p,p’-isomers on acth-induced steroid production and histology of the adrenal cortex. all 3 compounds eventually inhibited acth-induced steroid production but the order 
 of onset of inhibition was 
 m,p’-ddd&gt;mitotane&gt;p,p’-ddd with inhibition reaching 50% of control values at 27 minutes, 87 minutes and 4-18 hours, respectively. the order of onset of histological and 
 ultrastructural changes within the adrenals was also in the same order. there was a marked temporal 
 correlation between the percentage inhibition of acth-induced steroid production, the disruption of 
 normal cellular structure and arrangement in the zonae fasciculata and reticularis, and the severity of 
 the ddd-induced mitochondria damage in the cells of the inner two zones of the adrenal cortex by 
 each of the 3 isomers of ddd. the ultrastructural damage to mitochondria was detected prior to the 
 observation of histological lesions. cai et al (1995) studied the same three isomers in bovine 
 adrenocortical homogenates for their transformation into the corresponding bis-dichlorodiphenyl 
 acetic acid (dda) and the generation of covalent binding species. the order of both dda formation 
 and covalent binding was mitotane&gt;
 m,p’-ddd&gt;p,p’-ddd. moreover, the effects of the three isomers on cell growth and cortisol production with the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, nci h-295, 
 followed the same order as their dda formation and tissue binding. in addition to these data 
 correlating effect and covalent binding across isomers of mitotane, as mentioned above, martz and 
 straw (1980) correlated covalent binding 
 in vitro with the recognized differences in susceptibility of different species to the adrenolytic effect of the drug. thus, levels of metabolism and covalent binding 
 of 
 14c-o,p’-ddd measured in human adrenal mitochondria were intermediate between levels measured in dogs and rabbits and those measured in the least responsive species, i.e., rats and guinea 
 pigs. rabbits are moderately sensitive to the adrenocorticolytic effect and rats are essentially 
 unresponsive. 
 taken together, these data are supportive of the formation of reactive metabolites within the adrenal 
 cortex, leading to covalent binding, suppression of adrenal function and the observed histological 
 changes. 
 studies of mitotane metabolism 
 in vivo, as discussed further below, identified 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (
 o,p’-dda) as a major metabolite of mitotane. this was also observed in in vitro studies with bovine adrenal cortex homogenates (cai et al, 1995), as well as those of dog, rat and human (cai</p><p>12/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 et al, 1995). working with perfused dog adrenals in vitro, sinsheimer and freeman (1987) also identified 
 o,p’-dda as a metabolite. martz and straw (1977) demonstrated that the mitochondrial fraction of dog adrenal cortex homogenates were responsible for the metabolism of mitotane and 
 generation of 
 o,p’-dda, whilst the microsomal and soluble fractions were inactive. examining possible routes to generate 
 o,p’-dda from mitotane, cai et al (1995) proposed that there is hydroxylation of the methane hydrogen followed by spontaneous dehydrohalogenation leading to a 
 reactive acyl chloride which subsequently transforms into 
 o,p’-dda in the presence of water. the reactive acyl chloride could lead to both dda metabolite formation and binding to adrenal cortical 
 bionucleophiles. 
 touitou et al (1978) examined human adrenal glands 
 in vitro, from both mitotane treated and untreated patients with cushing’s syndrome (adrenal adenomas, hyperplasias or carcinoma) and from 
 normal subjects who died following road accidents (control adrenals). as compared to adrenals from 
 untreated cushing’s patients, those from mitotane treated patients produced markedly reduced 
 quantities of cortisol and cortisone from 11-deoxycortisol (1.1-3.4 and 0.5-0.9% conversion of 
 precursor to cortisol and cortisone, respectively, as compared to 34-64 and 2.5-7.3% in untreated 
 patients; conversion in control adrenals were 11-12 and 1.5-2.2%). synthesis of aldosterone and 18-
 hydroxycorticosterone from corticosterone were also reduced in adrenals from treated patients. these 
 data are consistent with inhibition of both 11β-hydroxylase and 18-hydroxylase activities hart and 
 straw (1971) and hart et al (1971) also showed inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase activities, but also 
 suggested an inhibitory effect on the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone. 
 overall, these data are consistent with formation of a reactive metabolite within the adrenal gland and 
 covalent binding to macromolecules resulting in an inhibitory effect on steroid synthesis. moreover, it 
 is clear from the histological evidence that this metabolism within the adrenal gland results in a 
 targeted adrenolytic effect. however, in addition to these effects within the adrenal, mitotane also 
 induces drug metabolizing enzymes, which could affect the levels of circulating steroids. kupfer et al 
 (1964) treated guinea pigs with 300 mg/kg/day of mitotane intraperitoneally for 5 days followed by 50 
 mg/kg/day for 7 days. an initial fall in urinary cortisol levels was seen without any concomitant effect 
 on cortisol metabolites. this progressed on continued treatment to a sustained decrease in cortisol 
 levels with an increase in metabolite levels; in particular, there was an increase in 6β-hydroxy cortisol, 
 an inactive metabolite of cortisol. a similar increase in urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol excretions has been 
 reported in mitotane treated humans (bledsoe et al cited by kupfer &amp; peets, 1966). enhanced cortisol 
 metabolism has also been reported in the rat (kupfer &amp; peets, 1966), together with a more general 
 liver enzyme induction as shown by effects on barbiturate metabolism (kupfer &amp; peets, 1966; straw 
 et al, 1965). however, these effects in rat and guinea pig were seen in species, which are resistant to 
 the adrenolytic effects of mitotane. similar inducing effects have been reported for 
 p,p’-ddd (azarnaoff et al, 1966).</p></section><section><header>impact on the adrenals</header><p>the original observations of nelson and woodard (1948; 1949) arose from a study in eleven dogs, which received doses of technical grade ddd of 50 to 200 (usually 50 or 80) mg/kg/day orally for 
 periods of 1 to 38 months. ten of the animals died or were sacrificed during this period; an unusually 
 consistent and severe atrophy of the adrenal cortex was observed in each animal at post-mortem. 
 histological examination of the adrenals showed the adrenal cortical parenchyma to be one-third to 
 one-half its usual thickness, with much distortion of the normal architecture and alteration of the 
 normal cellular appearances. the adrenal medulla appeared unaffected. these authors also commented 
 (nelson &amp; woodard, 1948) that rats and monkeys given ddd did not show the same changes, nor 
 were they seen in dogs administered the related insecticide ddt. 
 kaminsky et al (1962) administered 200 mg/kg/day of technical grade ddd to dogs and followed the 
 effects of ddd during the first few days of administration by a combination of adrenal biopsy and 
 examination of adrenals after sacrifice. the earliest ultraestructural change in the adrenal cortex was 
 observed in the mitochondria. thus, twelve hours after the first dose, mitochondria in the zona 
 fasciculata began to undergo dissolution and by twenty-four hours the mitochondria of the zona 
 fasciculata were essentially destroyed with only remnants of mitochondrial membranes remaining. 
 after 2 and 4 days treatment, findings were similar but more severe, and by 12 days the cells of the 
 zona fasciculata were shrunken, with abnormal nuclei, altered cytoplasmic lipid droplets and sparse</p><p>13/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 intracellular organelles. at this time the zona glomerulosa was also abnormal with swollen mitochondria and abnormal lipid droplets, but this area was less severely affected than the zona 
 fasciculata. in 2 dogs in which treatment was stopped after 3 doses, the adrenals appeared almost 
 normal 12 weeks later.</p><p>
 the above findings relate to studies carried out with technical grade ddd. nichols and hennigar 
 (1957) and cueto and brown (1958) worked with technical ddd and its fractions and identified 
 o,p’-ddd (mitotane) as the active fraction, whilst purified ddd, the 
 p,p’-ddd isomer, was inactive. in the experiments of cueto and brown (1958), 4 mg/kg/day of mitotane induced changes in the adrenals 
 of dogs and inhibited the 17-hydroxy corticosteroid response to administered acth.</p><p>
 vilar and tullner (1959) administered 5 to 100 mg/kg/day of mitotane to dogs for periods of 2 to 6 
 days. whilst the 5-mg/kg/day doses were inactive, the higher doses produced histological changes 
 within the zonas fasciculata and reticularis, and did not affect the zona glomerulosa; these changes 
 correlated with a decreased distribution of 3β-hydroxy sterols (as detected by the digitonin reaction) in 
 these areas. furthermore, the adrenal venous output of 17-hydroxy steroids was reduced, both basal 
 output and in response to acth injection. acth failed to alter the low secretion rate. even in the 
 presence of minimal histological lesions, the output of 17-hydroxy steroids was reduced to levels 
 previously observed in the same laboratory in the acutely hypophysectomized dog. komissarenko et al 
 (1968) confirmed these findings in a study involving 30 days administration of 50 or 100 mg/kg/day 
 of mitotane to dogs. administration for one week decreased plasma cortisol to unmeasurable levels 
 and completely suppressed the corticosteroid response and eosinopenic reaction to acth injection. 
 post-mortem examinations confirmed adrenal atrophy, with the zona reticularis being less affected 
 than other areas of the cortex. whilst the 50 mg/kg/day dose was satisfactorily supported by the 
 animals, the 100 mg/kg/day dose caused death after 2-3 weeks treatment with muscular weakness, 
 rejection of food, rapid emaciation, hypothermia, decrease of blood pressure and what are described as 
 “other symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency”. hart et al (1973) showed inhibition of acth-
 induced steroid output and ultrastructural changes in the adrenals within 2 hours of intravenous 
 injection of 60 mg/kg to dogs.</p><p>
 these studies, therefore, confirm and extend the original observations of nelson and woodard that 
 ddd, through its active component mitotane, causes adrenal cortical atrophy in the dog. the studies 
 focused on the dog, the species utilized by nelson and woodard, but these authors had also 
 commented on the lack of adrenolytic activity of ddd in the rat. no changes were seen in the adrenals 
 of rats in the one month repeated dose toxicity study at dose levels of 0, 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day of 
 mitotane, as discussed in section iv.2, and fregly et al (1968) reported no effect on adrenal weight in 
 rats after 6 weeks dosing with 68 or 182 mg/kg/day. although jensen et al (1987) reported 
 mitochondrial destruction in the adrenal zonas fasciculata and reticularis, with no effect on the zona 
 glomerulosa after 14 days intraperitoneal administration of 300 mg/kg/day of mitotane to guinea pigs, 
 these observations could not be confirmed by schteingart et al (1993). 
 as discussed below, several studies have addressed the possible mechanism of action of mitotane in 
 producing these changes in adrenal function. data indicate generation of reactive metabolites within 
 the adrenals resulting in covalent binding</p></section><section><header>secondary pharmacodynamics</header><p>the applicant did not submit any secondary pharmacodynamic studies. however, as described above mitotane appears to exert its therapeutic effect in adrenal carcinoma and cushing’s syndrome through 
 a dual action with an adrenolytic effect, which is restricted to susceptible species and the consequence 
 of metabolism within the adrenals and generation of a reactive intermediate, and an induction of liver 
 cortisol metabolism towards inactive metabolites, an effect which is more widely observed across 
 species. therefore, the pharmacodynamic properties of mitotane were considered to be known.</p></section><section><header>safety pharmacology</header><p>the applicant did not submit any safety pharmacology studies. taking into account that mitotane has been used for several decades, the safety profile of mitotane can be considered to be characterised 
 through the therapeutic use.</p><p>14/45</p><p>

 characteristics for lysodren.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>absorption- bioavailability</p><p>moy (1961) has described the pharmacokinetics of mitotane in a series of patients treated with various doses of drug for different durations. overall, he estimated that approximately 35 to 40% of the 
 product was absorbed after an oral administration.</p><p>
 limited data are available on plasma levels of mitotane in animals. watson et al (1987) studied 
 absorption of mitotane in dogs after a single oral dose under various conditions (see table below). 
 mitotane was given by mouth at 50 mg/kg and plasma o,p’-ddd concentrations were determined by 
 gas-liquid chromatography. a single dose of 50 mg/kg gave low plasma levels (auc
 0-12h of 2.39 mg.h/l; c
 max of 0.4 mg/l) when administered as tablets to fasted dogs but levels were higher with pure drug dissolved in maize oil given by stomach tube. the levels were highest with ground tablets mixed 
 in oil poured on dog food. when intact tablets were given in food, plasma levels were high (auc
 0-12h of 48.78 mg.h/l; cmax of 13.0 mg/l). maximal plasma concentrations were reached 2.5 to 4 hours after dosing and the apparent elimination half-life was approximately 2 hours. there were no differences 
 between males and females with respect to auc, c
 max or tmax.</p></section><section><header>species n

 distribution</p><p>working with technical grade ddd, which is likely to behave similarly to o,p’-ddd itself, finnegan et al (1949) found high levels in adipose tissue of both rats and dogs. moy (1961) also found high 
 levels of mitotane in adrenals in humans. the presence of mitotane was also observed in the adrenals, 
 fat, liver and kidney following 25 days treatment of dogs with 80 mg/kg/day of mitotane; levels were 
 the highest in fat tissues, followed by adrenals, then liver and kidney (cueto and brown (1958). it is 
 interesting to note that o,p’-ddd was concentrated at a higher level in the tissues analysed than p,p’-
 ddt, after administration of the same dose. cueto and brown states that the greater activity of o,p’ as 
 compared to p,p’-ddd could be explained on the basis of the differences in distribution and storage of 
 the isomers in tissues.</p><p>
 metabolism (in vitro/in vivo)</p><p>as discussed above, several studies have addressed the metabolism of mitotane as part of investigations aimed at determining its mechanism of action. thus, 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid 
 (o,p’-dda) has been identified as a major circulating and/or excreted metabolite in several species, 
 including rats, rabbits and man (reif &amp; sinsheimer, 1975); sinsheimer et al, 1972; andersen et al, 
 1999) and also, in studies with technical grade ddd, in mice (gold and brunk, 1982). o,p’-dda was 
 present in human plasma at levels 3 to 10 times those of mitotane itself. the metabolite o,p’-dde 
 (1,1-(o,p’-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2 dichloroethene) was also determined in human plasma by high–</p><p>15/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 performance liquid chromatography (andersen et al, 1999). no animal studies involving monitoring of plasma levels of o,p’-dda and o,p’-dde have been reported.</p><p>
 in addition, hydroxylated derivatives of o,p’-dda have been reported in urine of both rats (reif &amp; 
 sinsheimer, 1975) and man (reif et al, 1974). several other minor metabolites and conjugates have 
 also been reported.</p><p>
 several reports indicate that the adrenolytic effect of o,p’-ddd may be due to metabolic activation 
 and subsequent covalent modification of macromolecules in the adrenal cortex. cai et al (1995) have 
 suggested that the reactive intermediate is an acyl chloride leading to both binding to macromolecules 
 in the adrenal cortex and the generation of o,p’-dda. in vitro studies have correlated the species 
 differences in ability to metabolise mitotane by adrenal preparations and generate reactive metabolites 
 with the recognised in vivo differences in adrenolytic effects between these species.</p><p>
 the factors that determine the tissue-selective bioactivation of o,p’-ddd in different species are little 
 understood. 
 excretion</p><p>following the administration of a 100 mg oral dose of 14c-mitotane to rats, an average of 7.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and 87.8% in faeces within 8 days, with the majority appearing within the 
 first 3 days (reif &amp; sinsheimer, 1975). autoradiographic studies in mice following intravenous 
 administration of 
 14c-mitotane showed a high concentration of radioactivity in bile and intestinal contents, indicating significant biliary excretion (lund et al, 1986).</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic drug interaction</header><p>enzyme induction</p><p>
 as already noted, mitotane is able to induce the metabolism of steroids, particularly enhancing the 
 transformation of cortisol to its inactive 6β-hydroxy metabolite (kupfer et al, 1964; kupfer &amp; peets, 
 1966). this induction effect is, however, more general and has also been reported with barbiturates. 
 thus, straw et al (1965) reported that 3 days administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of mitotane to 
 rats reduced pentobarbital sleeping time (86.9±9 minutes in controls as compared to 29±3 and 20±2 
 minutes after 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively); corresponding increases in liver weight and in 
 vitro hepatic metabolism of pentobarbital were noted. azarnoff et al (1966) showed a reduction in 
 hexobarbital sleeping time after 3 days administration of 100 mg/kg/day to rats (142±8 and 20±4 
 minutes in control and treated animals, respectively); similar effects were reported for m,p’-ddd and 
 p,p’-ddd, and for p,p’-dda. kupfer and peets (1966) studied in vitro metabolism of hexobarbital in 
 liver microsomes obtained from rats treated with 300 mg/kg/day of mitotane; metabolic activity was 
 increased more in immature (about 60g body weight) than adult (about 200g body weight) animals.</p><p>
 the effects of mitotane in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats are further discussed in this report but 
 both studies performed suggested hepatic enzyme induction. fregly et al (1968) administered 68 and 
 182 mg/kg/day in the food for 6 weeks and observed an increase in thyroid weight, an increase in 
 thyroidal uptake of administered

 smith (handbook of pesticide toxicology, vol. 2, w. j. hayes and e. r. laws, jr., academic press,

 excessive exposures to chlorinated insecticides, is neurological hyperactivity. with ddt and related 
 compounds the effects progress gradually from mild tremors to convulsions.</p><p>
 taking into account the clinical experience with mitotane and the fact that the dose dependent adverse 
 reactions associated with mitotane administration are known the performance of single dose toxicity 
 studies was not considered necessary.</p></section><section><header>repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)</header><p>two published studies have been provided, one in rats with 6 weeks administration (fregly et al, 1968) and one in dogs with 4 weeks administration (komissarenko et al, 1968). in addition, in order to 
 provide data for the registration of mitotane in the usa, four-week studies were performed in the rat 
 and dog; the reports on these studies are included in this application. 
 fregly et al (1968) studied the effect of isomers of ddd on thyroid and adrenal function in rats. they 
 administered 68 or 182 mg/kg/day of mitotane in the diet (1 and 3 mg per kg of food) to rats for 6 
 weeks. there were 8 male rats per dose level. thyroid and adrenal glands were weighed at the end of 
 treatment and whilst adrenal weights were unaffected by treatment, thyroid weights were increased 
 (41 and 57% increase in thyroid to body weight ratios at 68 and 182 mg/kg/day, respectively, as 
 compared to control animals). the rate of oxygen consumption (measured the second week of 
 treatment) and gain in body weight were unaffected by treatment. there was and increased intake into 
 the thyroid of injected 
 131i, which was dose-related. the rate of loss of 131i from the thyroid gland was significantly faster for both treated groups than for controls, in a dose-related fashion. these results 
 suggest that the chronic administration of o,p’-ddd at the doses used resulted in a compensated 
 hypothyroidism in rats. there was no change in urinary 
 131i excretion although the faecal excretion of radioactivity was increased at the high dose. the increase in thyroid weight may be associated with 
 increased hepatic metabolism of thyroxine, but specific effects on the thyroid gland have not been 
 excluded. this publication also contains data on 
 m,p’-ddd and p,p’-ddd administered to female rats for 24 weeks; increased thyroid weights were again observed. 
 a study conducted in rats was not carried out under glp, groups of 10 male and 10 female rats 
 received 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg/day of o,p’-ddd by gavage for 4 weeks, with parallel control groups 
 receiving vehicle. the drug o,p’-ddd was administered to the rats in corn oil. at the end of treatment 
 6 rats per group were killed and the other 4 were kept for a 4-week recovery period. the following 
 parameters were measured: alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (sgot), 
 creatinine, glucose, haematology including haematocrit, haemoglobin, differential, bleeding and 
 clotting time, white blood cell count. there was no effect of treatment on body weight or 
 haematological parameters. blood biochemistry showed no effect on sgot, but there was an 
 elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase in the three dose levels, which was dose-related and partially 
 reversible during the recovery phase. the rats receiving a dose of 33 mg/kg/day exhibited a 63 % 
 increase in the serum alkaline phosphatase activity (week 4). this finding is generally observed 
 whenever chlorinated hycrocarbons are administered to animals. there were no changes in 17-keto or 
 17-hydroxy corticosteroid excretion patterns. organ weights, including adrenals, were unchanged by 
 treatment. thyroid weight was not assessed in this study. macroscopic post-mortem examinations did 
 not show drug-related changes, nor did histopathological examinations of the liver or adrenals.</p><p>17/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 electron microscopic examination of adrenals and livers from high dose animals at the end of treatment did not show any changes in the adrenals, but livers revealed consistently elevated quantities 
 of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and reduced glycogen content as compared to controls, features 
 consistent with induction of drug metabolising enzymes. 
 komissarenko et al (1968) studied the effect of o,p’-ddd on the function and morphology of the 
 adrenal cortex as well as on hematomorphology in dogs. they administered mitotane, 50 and 100 
 mg/kg/day, to 4 and 5 dogs respectively, for 30 days. after one week, plasma cortisol levels were 
 decreased to below the level of detection in both treated groups and the corticosteroid response and 
 eosinopenic reaction to acth administration were absent. eosinophilia, basophilia and 
 lymphocytosis were observed. at the end of the o,p’-ddd treatment was observed a rise of the 
 absolute number of neutrophils. the authors indicated that these changes in blood composition 
 resemble those observed in adrenalectomized dogs, i.e. a sharp increase of eosinophils and a gradual 
 rising of lymphocytes. the difference found was the significant increase of the absolute number of 
 neutrophils in dogs which received o,p’-ddd for 30 days. the 50 mg/kg/day dose level was 
 reasonably well tolerated for the full 30 days, but animals receiving 100 mg/kg/day died after two to 
 three weeks treatment. at autopsy, treated animals showed no pathological changes in the liver, 
 kidney, brain or other organs, although mesenteric lymph nodes were somewhat enlarged. the adrenal 
 cortex was atrophied, but the medulla was unaffected. the effect was greater at 100 mg/kg/day for 15 
 days than at 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days. 
 a study was conducted for the national cancer institute. the doses in the non-glp 28-day dog study 
 were 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, administered by capsule to groups of three male and three female 
 animals per dose level. two animals per group were killed after 28 days and the remaining animal 
 kept for a 28-day recovery period. five animals receiving 100 mg/kg/day died during the dosing 
 period (days 1, 14, 15, 16 and 17) and the dose level in the sixth was reduced to 75 mg/kg/day after 17 
 days; one animal receiving 50 mg/kg/day died on day 23. animals that died showed a decrease in 
 appetite and water intake in the days prior to death. there was no marked effect on body weight, 
 whether the animals survived or not. the following parameters were observed: alkaline phosphatase, 
 serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (sgot), creatinine, glucose, haematology including 
 haematocrit, haemoglobin, differential, bleeding and clotting time, white blood cell count. white 
 blood cell numbers were dose-relatedly and reversibly increased, being most pronounced in animals 
 which died; there were no other changes in haematological parameters. serum glucose, sgot and 
 creatinine were unchanged by treatment, but serum alkaline phosphatase was dose-relatedly increased. 
 alkaline phosphatase activity is still elevated 28 days after cessation of o,p’-ddd administration. 
 there was no marked effect on organ weights, although adrenal weights were slightly lower at the mid 
 and high doses. histopathology showed several changes in animals that died, but in examining all 
 animals the major changes were seen in the adrenals, particularly at the high dose. in addition to the 
 adrenal changes, the dogs on high dosage had involvement of the liver, with atrophy of cells and 
 centro-lobular and midzonal congestion. the changes in the adrenals were confirmed by electron 
 microscopy with adrenals at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day being readily distinguishable from controls 
 because of the massive accumulation of electron dense material in the region of the zona reticularis 
 and increased quantities of connective tissue and leukocytic infiltration. cells of the zona fasciculata 
 in dogs examined immediately after the final dose had mitochondria, which had a highly transparent 
 matrix. the zona glomerulosa did not appear to be affected.</p><p>data on repeated-dose toxicity is limited to studies with a duration of 4-6 weeks: this absence of 
 repeated-dose toxicity studies longer than 4-6 weeks duration can be considered to be acceptable in the 
 light of the clinical experience involving longer term treatments.</p></section><section><header>genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)</header><p>one report in the literature indicates a negative effect in the ames test in salmonella typhimurium strains ta100 and ta98, using rat liver or mouse lung and liver s9 fractions as metabolic activating systems (lund et al, 1990). thus, in a series of initial experiments, the mutagenic effect of o,p’-ddd

 lund and co-authors (1990) detected the ability of o,p’-ddd to induce cell proliferation in the mouse 
 lung. they studied the effects of o,p’-ddd on the dna synthesis in the c57b1 mouse lung and liver. 
 as determined by 3h-thymidine incorporation into dna, a selective increase in the lung dna 
 synthesis (+59%) was observed 2 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg o,p’-ddd. 
 using microautoradiography, a 9 times higher rate of cell proliferation was observed in the lung 4 
 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg/kg o,p’-ddd. the induced cell proliferation may 
 indicate a tumour-promotor activity of o,p’-ddd in the mouse lung. moreover, a long-term study of 
 the isomer p,p’-ddd demonstrated an increased incidence of lung and liver tumours in mice, while 
 p,p’-ddt and p,p’-dde , a stable ddt metabolite, induced liver tumours (innes et al., 1969; tomatis 
 et al., 1974).</p></section><section><header>reproductive and developmental studies</header><p>polychlorinated hydrocarbons compounds are known to have potential estrogenic activities. mitotane has been reported to bind to the rat uterine estrogen receptor (nelson cited by johnson et al, 1992). 
 johnson et al (1992) studied two estrogenic actions, initiation of implantation and maintenance of 
 pregnancy, using the hypophysectomized, delayed-implanting rat model. the animals were exposed to 
 several polychlorinated hydrocarbons. o,p’-ddd was nearly devoid of estrogenic activity for initiating 
 implantation. chen and co-authors (1997) determined whether the ddt isomers p,p’-ddt, o,p’-ddt, 
 p,p’-ddd, o,p’-ddd, p,p’-dde, o,p’-dde, and p,p’-dda, could bind to and transcriptionally 
 activate the human estrogen receptor. the results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p’-
 ddd, o,p’-dde, and p,p’-ddt, as well as the established estrogenic o,p’-ddt, were able to bind 
 specifically to the her with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities of the her than that of 
 estradiol. the relative affinities of o,p’-ddt, o,p’-ddd, o,p’-dde, and p,p’-ddt for the receptor 
 were similar. in contrast, only o,p’-ddt, but not p,p’-ddt, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. 
 moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the ddt isomers and 
 metabolites could transcriptionally activate the human estrogen receptor (her), demonstrated that an 
 o,p’-ddt metabolite could transactivate the her with a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of 
 estradiol. the ddt isomers and metabolites that bound the her in vitro, including o,p’-ddd,</p><p>19/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacz reporter gene in the yeast systems. these compounds also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive human mammary 
 mcf-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the her. the 
 studies with ddt isomers and metabolites conducted in rodent models may not represent the true 
 potency of these compounds in humans. the difference in binding of ddt isomers and metabolites to 
 the rat versus the human er might be explained by the eight amino acid differences in the ligand 
 binding domain of the two receptors.</p><p>
 in general, cytotoxic/cytostatic substances are assumed to cause reproductive disturbances (see the 
 cpmp note for guidance on the preclinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products 
 (cpmp/swp/997/96). in relation to the possible teratogenicity of mitotane in humans, leiba et al 
 (1989) reported on a cushing’s patient who had a therapeutic abortion and the embryo on examination 
 was observed to show some abnormalities in the adrenal cortex. thus, the histopathological 
 examination of the embryo, aged about 42 days, revealed a dysmorphogenetic event in the cortical 
 primordia characterized by pycnotic sympathoblasts.</p><p>
 ddt and related polychlorinated biphenyls are known to have unwanted effects on pregnancy and the 
 foetus. mitotane should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed and if the clinical benefit 
 clearly outweighs any potential risk to the foetus. women of childbearing potential should be advised 
 to use effective contraception during treatment. the prolonged elimination of mitotane from the body 
 after treatment discontinuation should be considered.</p><p>
 ddt and related polychlorinated biphenyls have been detected in human milk (polishuk z. w. et al., 
 1977, pesticides monitoring 10, 121-129) as well as in the placenta of pregnant rabbits, in the cord 
 blood of newborns and in stillborn tissues (polishuk z. w. et al., 1977, environ res. 13, 278-284). 
 decreases in fetal body and organ weights were observed in rabbits following dosing of 1 mg/kg/day 
 of ddt to maternal animals (fabro s. et al., 1984, am. j. obstet. gynecol., 148, 929). other studies 
 were reported that indicated decreased lengths of gestation, increased resorption rates, preweaning 
 mortality, learning impairment in mice (agency for toxic substances and disease registry, u.s. 
 dept. of commerce, ntis pb90-182171, 1989). moreover, leiba et al (1989) reported on a cushing’s 
 patient who had a therapeutic abortion after o,p’ -ddd treatment and the embryo on examination was 
 observed to show some abnormalities in the adrenal cortex. therefore, mitotane is expected to be 
 embriotoxic/teratogenic and to cause reproductive disturbances.</p></section><section><header>other toxicity studies</header><p>in a series of studies, lund et al (1986, 1989, 1990) studied covalent binding to tissues following in vivo</p><p>administration of 14c-mitotane to mice and rabbits, as well as in in vitro systems. autoradiographic studies in mice showed selective accumulation of radioactivity in the lung (lund et 
 al, 1986). exhaustive extraction of lung tissue showed a large fraction of the radioactivity to be 
 covalently bound to protein; binding was also shown in the liver, though at levels 20-30 times lower. 
 inhibition of binding in metyrapone treated animals indicated formation of cytochrome p450 catalysed 
 reactive metabolites. further 
 in vitro studies with mouse lung and liver s9 preparations (lund et al, 1989) demonstrated an oxidative cytochrome p450 mediated formation in both lung and liver of 
 mitotane metabolites that bound covalently to proteins, phospholipids and to added naked dna. the 
 apparent km value for covalent binding was lower in lung than liver and, moreover, glutathione 
 addition decreased binding more efficiently in liver than lung fractions; both factors could contribute 
 to the difference in binding between these tissues, observed both 
 in vivo and in vitro. the studies on mouse lung were extended to the rabbit, allowing a more detailed examination of the cell types 
 involved. clara cells had the highest capacity to bind radioactivity following 
 in vitro incubation with 14c-mitotane, followed by alveolar type ii cells and a fraction of mixed unidentified lung cells; no binding was observed in alveolar macrophages (lund et al, 1990). 
 the possible consequences of this covalent binding remain unexplained although lund et al (1990) 
 have shown increased dna synthesis in mouse lung and liver following a single intraperitoneal 
 administration of 100 or 500 mg/kg of mitotane and have suggested this may indicate a tissue selective 
 promoter activity in the mouse lung.</p><p>20/45</p><p>
 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>discussion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>the potential of mitotane to affect the adrenals was first noted by nelson and woodard (1948). since these initial observations, several publications confirmed the adrenalytic activity of mitotane, 
 particularly in dogs. histological examination showed a disruption of normal cellular structure and 
 arrangement in the innermost zones of the adrenal cortex (zonas fasciculata and reticularis). the 
 earliest observable ultrastructural change in the dog adrenal cortex was the swelling, dissolution and 
 rupture of mitochondria in the zona fasciculata-reticularis area. these changes were correlated with a 
 reduction of the adrenal output of 17-hydroxy steroid and an inhibition of acth-induced steroid 
 production.</p><p>
 the bibliographical data are consistent with formation of a reactive metabolite within the adrenal 
 gland and covalent binding to macromolecules resulting in an inhibitory effect on steroid synthesis. 
 moreover, it is clear from the histological evidence that this metabolism within the adrenal gland 
 results in a targeted adrenolytic effect.</p><p>
 in addition to these effects within the adrenal gland, mitotane also induces enzymes involved in the 
 metabolism of drugs, which could affect the levels of circulating steroids. enhanced cortisol 
 metabolism has also been reported in rats and guinea - pigs.</p><p>
 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (o,p’-dda) has been identified as a major excreted metabolite in 
 several species, including rats, rabbits and man and also, in studies with technical grade ddd, in mice. 
 o,p’-dda was present in human plasma at levels 3 to 10 times those of mitotane itself.</p><p>
 moy (1961) has described the pharmacokinetics of mitotane in a series of patients treated with various 
 doses of drug for different durations. overall, he estimated that approximately 35 to 40% of the 
 product was absorbed after an oral administration.</p><p>
 watson et al (1987) studied absorption of mitotane in dogs after a single oral dose under various 
 conditions (see table below). mitotane was given by mouth at 50 mg/kg. a single dose of 50 mg/kg 
 gave low plasma levels (auc
 0-12h of 2.39 mg.h/l; cmax of 0.4 mg/l) when administered as tablets to fasted dogs but levels were higher with pure drug dissolved in maize oil given by stomach tube. 
 maximal plasma concentrations were reached 2.5 to 4 hours after dosing and the apparent elimination 
 half-life was approximately 2 hours. mitotane distributes in the adrenals, fat, liver and kidney.</p><p>
 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (o,p’-dda) has been identified as a major circulating and/or excreted 
 metabolite in several species, including rats, rabbits and man. o,p’-dda was present in human plasma 
 at levels 3 to 10 times those of mitotane itself. the metabolite o,p’-dde (1,1-(o,p’-dichlorodiphenyl)-
 2,2 dichloroethene) was also determined in human plasma. in addition, hydroxylated derivatives of 
 o,p’-dda have been found in urine of both rats. several other minor metabolites and conjugates have 
 also been reported.</p><p>
 following the administration of a 100 mg oral dose of 
 14c-mitotane to rats, an average of 7.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and 87.8% in faeces within 8 days, with the majority appearing within the 
 first 3 days. autoradiographic studies in mice following intravenous administration of 
 14c-mitotane showed a high concentration of radioactivity in bile and intestinal contents, indicating significant 
 biliary excretion.</p><p>
 the data suggest that mitotane could provoke metabolic interactions with concomitant medication and 
 care should thus be taken in its clinical use.</p><p>
 target organs identified in the toxicity studies in rats and dogs were thyroid and liver.</p><p>
 the published 6 week study in rats focuses on the effect of o,p’-ddd on thyroid and adrenal function. 
 an increase was observed in thyroid weight, an increase in thyroidal uptake of administered 
 131i and an increase in excreted faecal radioactivity were also observed.</p><p>21/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 the published 4 week study in dogs focuses on the effect of o,p’-ddd on the function and morphology of the adrenal cortex as well as on hematomorphology. after o,p’-ddd administration. 
 plasma cortisol levels were decreased to below the level of detection in treated groups and the 
 corticosteroid response and eosinopenic reaction to acth administration were absent. eosinophilia, 
 basophilia and lymphocytosis were observed. at the end of the o,p’-ddd treatment was observed a 
 rise of the absolute number of neutrophils. at autopsy, the adrenal cortex was atrophied, but the 
 medulla was unaffected.</p><p>
 in the 28 days dog study a dose-dependent and reversible increase of white blood cell numbers was 
 observed, this effect was most pronounced in animals that died. a dose-related increase of serum 
 alkaline phosphatase was also observed. alkaline phosphatase activity was still elevated 28 days after 
 cessation of o,p’-ddd administration. histopathology showed major changes in the adrenals, 
 particularly at the high dose. moreover, the dogs on high dosage had involvement of the liver, with 
 atrophy of cells and centro-lobular and midzonal congestion the changes in the adrenals were 
 confirmed by electron microscopy with massive accumulation of electron dense material in the region 
 of the zona reticularis and increased quantities of connective tissue and leukocytic infiltration. cells of 
 the zona fasciculata in dogs examined immediately after the final dose had mitochondria which had a 
 highly transparent matrix. the zona glomerulosa did not appear to be affected.</p><p>
 one report in the literature indicates a negative effect in the ames test in salmonella typhimurium 
 strains ta100 and ta98, using rat liver or mouse lung and liver s9 fractions as metabolic activating 
 systems. carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with mitotane but considering that the life 
 expectancy of the patients with adrenocortical carcinoma is short, carcinogenicity studies are 
 considered not required. lund and co-authors (1990) detected the ability of o,p’-ddd to induce cell 
 proliferation in the mouse lung. the induced cell proliferation may indicate a tumour-promotor 
 activity of o,p’-ddd.</p><p>
 formal studies on the possible effects of mitotane on reproductive functions have not been performed. 
 polychlorinated hydrocarbons as a class are recognized as having potential estrogenic activities. 
 mitotane is expected to be embryotoxic/teratogenic and to cause reproductive disturbances. therefore, 
 since animal studies with similar substances have shown reproductive toxicity, some warnings were 
 included in the relevant sections of the summary of product characteristics for lysodren. lysodren is 
 contraindicated with breastfeeding. lysodren should be given to pregnant women only if the expected 
 clinical benefit clearly outweighs any potential risk to the foetus. women of childbearing potential 
 should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment.</p><p>
 the non-clinical data submitted correspond to old publications, which do not specify the glp 
 fulfilment. the cpmp considered that the lack of information regarding compliance with the current 
 glp did not impact on the validity of the results of these studies.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical aspects</header><p>as already stated in the introduction of this report, malignant neoplasms of the adrenal cortex such as adrenal cortical carcinoma are rare; they account for 0.05 to 0.2 per cent of all cancers, and show a 
 bimodal age distribution, with the first peak occurring before the age of 5 years and the second in the 
 fourth to fifth decade. there is a female predominance, accounting for 55 to 85 per cent of the cases, 
 particularly among functional tumours. men with adrenal cortical carcinoma tend to be older than 
 women.</p><p>
 approximately 60 percent of patients have a functional adrenal cortical carcinoma, defined by the 
 existence of signs of excess adrenal hormone production. among functional tumours, cushing’s 
 syndrome is evidenced in half of the patients and virilization in one third of them, whereas 
 hyperaldosteronism, feminisation or the combination of cushing’s syndrome and virilization account 
 for a minority of patients. nearly half of adult carcinomas are non-functional, and these patients 
 present clinically with abdominal or flank pain or as an incidentally discovered adrenal mass.</p><p>22/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, or bone may cause symptoms before the primary diagnosis is made.</p><p>
 resectable recurrences are usually operated on, and a number of patients remain disease-free 
 thereafter. a drug therapy is often administered to patients whose disease is unresectable at 
 presentation or at relapse. an overview of the published data with different products is given below 
 (see tale below). radiotherapy is only indicated as palliative treatment for patients with bone 
 metastases.</p><p>
 as stated in the well-established use justification of this document, mitotane is commonly prescribed 
 for the treatment of patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. other chemotherapy agents used in this 
 indication are cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin and other. these are usually employed in combination 
 regimens (cisplatin-etoposide, cisplatin-doxorubicin-5-fu, ...) able to induce short lived objective 
 responses in about 20-30% of patients (or even higher in when administered concurrently with 
 mitotane). the toxicity is however remarkable in this palliative setting and their impact in disease 
 progression, survival or quality on life remain unproven.</p><p>

 6th ed. lippincott williams &amp;wilkins, philadelphia 2001, page 1779.</p><p>the prognosis of adrenal cortical carcinoma tumours is generally poor in adults and somehow better in children. in a recent review of 7 large series, the mean survival was 18 months. most series showed no 
 statistically significant differences based on patients’ age, gender or tumour functional status. 
 however, stage was an important prognostic predictor. for stages i to iv tumours, approximate 5-year</p><p>23/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 survival was 30-45%, 12.5-57%, 5-18% and 0%, respectively. surgical resection was the only therapy that significantly prolonged survival, particularly when disease was detected at stages ii and i. median 
 survival in patients with unresectable tumours was 3 to 9 months, whereas after complete resection 
 median survival was 13 to 28 months.</p><p>
 therefore in this context it is important in the light of the data published with mitotane to define the 
 actual place and effectiveness of mitotane in the treatment of patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>available information is very limited, and derives mainly from a study published in 1961 (moy et al 1961).</p><p>
 absorption in the study published in 1961, absorption and excretion and tissue levels of mitotane were investigated in 18 patients with metastatic adrenal cancer. the patients ranged in age from 8 to 56 
 years. the intake dosage varies among patients, but the mean regimen schedule was 10 g of mitotane 
 per day (13 patients). for oral use, mitotane was given in tablets (lysodren) or in capsules containing 
 0.5 g of the dry powder. some patients received intravenous mitotane (courses up to 5 g/day). as it 
 was frequently necessary to stop or lower the dosage of mitotane because of side effects or changes in 
 the patients’ clinical status, the parameters were not calculated within all 18 patients. the number of 
 patients used for the parameters calculation is shown in the table below. samples were obtained from 
 fat, tumour, adrenal, brain, and liver, in 7 cases brought to autopsy, and 13 samples of subcutaneous 
 abdominal fat from 10 patients by autopsy/biopsy. the determination of the mitotane plasma 
 concentrations was performed with a spectrophotometric method.</p><p>

 the blood levels of mitotane from 13 patients, who were able to maintain a dose of approximately 
 10 g per day during a stage of treatment, were plotted against the quantity of mitotane administered 
 (expressed in grams). it was not possible to find a relationship between blood levels and patient’s 
 response or toxicity. variable blood levels were achieved (up to 140 mg/l in a child who received 
 large doses and did not respond to the treatment). in 4 patients in whom the drug was discontinued, 
 serum levels could not be detected with the spectrophotometric method after 6 to 9 weeks.</p><p>
 the main conclusions of this study were that 35 to 40 percent of the substance is absorbed from the 
 gastro-intestinal tract. 
 use of different formulations in the clinical trials and bioequivalence. the same patients excreted about 10% of the daily dose as urinary metabolites. when this percentage was compared with that excreted by some patients receiving courses up to 5g/day mitotane 
 intravenously (urinary excretion was about 25%), it appeared that about 40% of the oral dose was 
 absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. accordingly, faecal excretion amounted to 66.5, 63.2 and 
 62% in three patients taking 5, 10 and 15g/day of mitotane, respectively (moy et al 1961).</p><p>24/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 the main formulation used in this study</p><p>was the 0.5g capsules of the dry powder. however, tablets of mitotane (lysodren) and other formulations were also briefly tested, without apparent therapeutic 
 advantage (moy et al 1961).</p><p>
 literature reports often do not indicate the formulation of mitotane used. however, all publications 
 from north america relate to lysodren (product subject to of the present application). similarly, in 
 some european countries (italy, netherlands), publications explicitly refer to lysodren. the various 
 formulations in the other european countries are unknown, except for france where a capsule 
 formulation of mitotane has been provided by the central pharmacy galenic department.</p><p>
 distribution in tissue samples, it was not possible to find a relationship between tissue levels and response. analysis of tissue samples obtained by biopsy or at autopsy showed that mitotane distributed in most 
 tissue but stored primarily in fat-containing tissues (moy et al 1961). 
 elimination the presumed activating metabolic pathway for mitotane involves biotransformation to an acyl chloride, which may bind covalently to macromolecules in the adrenal cortex or hydrolyse to form 
 o,p’-dda (cai et al 1995). other metabolic pathway include glycine conjugation of o,p’-dda, and 
 hydroxylation in the 3-, 4- and 5-position and dihydroxylation in the 3,4- and 4,5-position (sinsheimer 
 et al 1972; reif et al 1974).</p><p>
 published studies indicate that in adrenal carcinoma patients the o,p’-dda plasma concentrations are 
 about 10 times higher than those of the parent compound (andersen et al 1999; inouye et al 1987).</p><p>
 patients treated intravenously and orally excreted the equivalent of about 25 and 10 per cent of their 
 daily dose as urinary metabolite over 24 hours, respectively. a smaller percentage was identified also 
 in a metabolised form in the faeces (moy et al 1961).</p><p>
 approximately 25% of the amount absorbed each day (about 40%) appeared in the urine in a 
 metabolised form (possibly o,p’-dda). unchanged mitotane was not detected in the urine (reif. et al 
 1974). a variable amount of metabolite(s) (1% to 17%) was also excreted in the bile. no unchanged 
 mitotane appeared in bile too (moy et al 1961).</p><p>
 terminal plasma half-life was estimated to be ranging from 18 to 159 days. 
 dose proportionality and time dependencies non-linearity (dose-proportionality and time dependency) was never studied as such. however, in a prospective study in 24 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma taking mitotane as first-line therapy (n 
 = 13), or as adjuvant therapy ( n = 11), a correlation was observed between the highest plasma trough 
 concentration and the cumulative daily dose of mitotane (r
 2 = 0.346; p = 0.0025) (baudin et al 2001) suggesting a dose-proportionality. 
 special populations no publication investigating the pharmacokinetics properties of mitotane in patients with impaired renal or liver function were submitted in the application. no specific pharmacokinetic study was 
 conducted in children. the summary of product characteristics for lysodren reflects the limited 
 amount of clinical data in the paediatric population: “
 the safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 years have not been established and, at present only very limited data are available in this age 
 group
 ”. intra- and inter-individual variability as mentioned before (baudin et al 2001), the daily dose of mitotane in patients was associated with the highest plasma trough levels. no correlation was found between plasma concentration and age, 
 gender or body mass index. this suggested that the daily dose accounted for a substantial part of the 
 inter-patient variability in the plasma of mitotane concentrations.</p><p>25/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 interaction studies mitotane stimulates the clearance of warfarin by hepatic enzyme induction, leading to an increase in dosage requirements for the anticoagulant (cuddy and loftus 1986).</p><p>
 a report in the literature suggests that, in a single patient bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, the 
 antimineralocorticoid spironolactone blocks the effect of mitotane and that, therefore the two products 
 should not be used together (wortsman and soler 1977). therefore, this association has been 
 contraindicated in the summary of product characteristics for lysodren.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics</header><p>the action of mitotane on the adrenals appears to result from both a direct effect leading to decrease in cortisol production, and an increase in cortisol metabolism. most available information is based on 
 animal studies.</p><p>
 mechanism of action data suggest that the drug acts as an adrenal cytotoxic agent suppressing the adrenal cortex, and it can also modify the peripheral metabolism of steroids. its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown.</p><p>
 mitotane appears to selectively inhibit adrenocortical function by a direct cytotoxic effect and, as a 
 consequence, inhibits production of corticosteroids. the product causes focal degeneration in the zona 
 fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex with resultant atrophy. technical grade ddd has long 
 been shown to induce adrenocortical atrophy and hepatic damage in dogs (nelson and woodward 
 1948; nelson and woodward 1949). this specie is much more sensitive to the adrenocortical actions 
 of mitotane than others like the mouse, rabbit, monkey or rat. the atrophy involved mainly the inner 
 zones of the adrenal cortex and not the zona glomerulosa</p><p>(vilar and tullner 1959; kaminsky, luse et 
 al. 1962). the active component was shown to be o,p’-ddd (mitotane) an isomer and an impurity in 
 the technical grade ddd (nichols and hennegar 1957; cueto and brown 1958), being p,p’-ddd 
 itself inactive.</p><p>
 this effect may be mediated through covalent binding of mitotane metabolites to mitochondrial 
 proteins. the metabolism of mitotane was seen to correlate with the generation of covalent binding 
 species. the potential of the insecticide ddd (2,2-bis (parachlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane) to affect 
 the adrenals was first noted by nelson and woodard; these authors, working with technical grade 
 ddd, noted adrenocortical atrophy in dogs. in animals, there is evidence that mitotane is transformed 
 to an acyl chloride by a mitochondrial p450-mediated hydroxylation and that the acyl chloride 
 covalently combines with specific bionucleophiles within the adrenal cortical cell for the adrenalytic 
 effect to take place. in human, o,p’-dichloro-diphenyl acetic acid (o,p’-dda) has been identified as a 
 metabolite of mitotane (sinsheimer, guilford et al. 1972). the generation of o,p’-dda by adrenal 
 homogenates across different species (bovine, dog, rat and human glands) has been correlated with the 
 recognised sensitivity of these species to the adrenolytic effect of mitotane (cai, counsell et al. 1995).</p><p>
 mitotane has also been demonstrated to inhibit acth-induced steroidogenesis in the dog adrenals by 
 preventing the intramitochondrial-induced conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. this is due to 
 the generation of reactive intermediate metabolites that are capable of covalent binding to 
 mitochondrial macromolecules.</p><p>
 mitotane has also been shown to induce the metabolism of corticosteroids in animals (kupfer, balazs 
 et al. 1964; straw, waters et al. 1965), thus reducing their active concentrations and possibly 
 alleviating any effects consequent to their excessive production in cases of adrenal carcinoma.</p><p>
 such mechanisms of action imply that steroid compensation may be necessary when treating patients 
 with mitotane.</p><p>
 therefore, the action of mitotane on the adrenals thus appears to be result of both a direct effect 
 resulting in a decrease in cortisol production and an increase in cortisol metabolism. in practical terms,</p><p>26/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 such mechanism implies that steroid compensation may be necessary when treating patients with mitotane.</p><p>
 primary pharmacology the application included sixteen references dealing with human pharmacodynamics, only three of these references (sinsheimer, guilford et al. 1972; bukowski, wolfe et al. 1993; cai, counsell et al. 
 1995) actually presented studies in humans. sinsheimer et al identified o,p’-dichlorodiphenyl acetic 
 acid as the principal urinary metabolite of the insecticide p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltritrichloroethane in 
 three patients. cai et al explored the relationship of the metabolism of mitotane and its binding adrenal 
 cortex tissue from several sources, including normal adrenal cortex and tumour homogenates. the 
 objective was to detect the mitotane moiety responsible for its covalent binding. an acyl chloride 
 appeared to be the reactive moiety of mitotane, which led to both dda metabolite formation and 
 binding adrenal cortex bionucleophiles. (bukowski, wolfe et al. 1993) conducted a phase ii study of 
 chemotherapy with and without mitotane in 37 patients with adrenal cortex carcinoma. the combined 
 regimen has activity but moderate to severe toxicity too. finally, van geertruyden and coll. (van 
 geertruyden, de myttenaere et al. 1980) report on one case of adrenal cortex carcinoma with 
 hypercorticism, in whom treatment with mitotane led to temporary clinical and biological remission.</p><p>
 (feller, hoekman et al. 1997) reported a case of a patient with adrenal carcinoma, whose single-cell 
 suspensions highly expressed a glycoprotein (pgp) implicated in drug multiresistance. in vitro, 
 mitotane was able to block the expression of the protein as well as the related pgp resistance. 
 however, according to the applicant “these results did not translate in clinical use since in this patient 
 mitotane has been reported to be inactive”. interestingly enough, this paper reports that mitotane 
 normalised cortisol production but failed to induce tumor regression. 
 secondary pharmacology the applicant did not submit any data exploring the secondary pharmacological properties of mitotane in humans. the absence of such studies was justified by the fact that mitotane has been used 
 for several decades. 
 conclusion on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics the only available pharmacokinetic data comes from a study performed in the early sixties providing information that, at present, is clearly insufficient. approximately 40% of the drug is absorbed, and 
 approximately 10% of the dose is recovered in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite. active 
 metabolite excreted in the bile varies from 1-17%. the substance is apparently stored in fat tissues, but 
 mitotane can be found in most tissues. many important aspects of the pharmacokinetics of mitotane 
 have not been investigated, therefore the cpmp requested the applicant to commit to further 
 characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of mitotane as a post-authorisation commitment.</p><p>
 as far as the pharmacodynamic interactions are concerned, mitotane may increase the metabolism of 
 warfarin, causing a decrease in levels. it can also interact with spironolactone, which may decrease 
 mitotane effect. finally, central nervous system depressants may potentiate its toxicity.</p><p>
 the mechanism of action of mitotane is described in its general aspects. mitotane apparently causes 
 adrenal inhibition without cellular destruction. the exact mechanism of action is unknown. it inhibits 
 cholesterol side-chain cleavage and 11-beta-oxyhydrase reactions. it also appears to reduce the 
 peripheral metabolism of steroids. alteration of extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol induces 
 measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroid while stimulating the formation of 6-beta-hydroxy cortisol.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy  dose response studies</header><p>the applicant suggested the existence of a relation between the plasma concentrations of mitotane and the pharmacodynamic properties of the product. these publications suggest that the therapeutic</p><p>27/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 window for mitotane would lie in plasma concentrations between 14 and 20 mg/l. although there are some published data supporting such relation, this hypothesis is far from being demonstrated.</p><p>
 these data suggest that serum mitotane concentrations greater than 14 mg/l may induce a tumour 
 regression in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, in addition serum concentrations greater than 
 20 mg/l may be associated with central nervous system adverse reactions. however, interestingly, the 
 appropriate serum levels can be achieved with lower daily doses of mitotane as lysodren formulation 
 (2 to 3 g/daily) and some reports suggest that monitoring the plasma levels of mitotane leads to lower 
 daily administration, hence a better tolerance.</p><p>
 the data that might be considered as pivotal for supporting this pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
 (pk/pd) relationship was published in a french study using a different formulation of mitotane whose 
 pharmacokinetic profile seems to be considerably different than the one for lysodren. the same study 
 (baudin, pellegriti et al. 2001) showed that the cumulative mitotane dose was the only parameter 
 possibly correlated with plasma level, while the daily mitotane dose explained only 35% of the 
 variability between patients in the plasma level.</p></section><section><header>therapeutic window.</header><p> kopf, goretzki et al. 2001 suggests a dose-response relationship between mitotane serum level and survival. another original publication (haak, hermans et al. 1994) suggests 
 that mitotane is effective only when high serum levels can be achieved. however, the same paper also 
 reports that 
 1. 
 62 patients received mitotane and only 30 achieved levels ranging 14-50 mg/l. 
 2. 
 among the 29 patients with measurable tumour size, a tumour response was seen in only 6 out 
 of 14 patients with high mitotane serum levels 
 3. 
 6 out of the 11 patients treated with mitotane after apparently complete resection had serum 
 levels &gt;14 mg/l and a median survival of 51 months compared with 61 months in those with no 
 adjuvant therapy 
 4. 
 5 mg/l appears to be the threshold serum level for gastro-intestinal toxicity and 15 mg/l the 
 threshold for neuropsychological toxicity. 
 5. 
 therefore, there appears to be no therapeutic window; if any, it is achieved in few patients only. 
 6. 
 high doses (12-14g/day) are also needed to control hypercortisolism in 50-60% of the patients 
 (latronico &amp; chrousos, 1997).</p><p>
 although many authors seem to support this relationship, monitoring of mitotane serum levels is not 
 common practice in many european centres.</p></section><section><header>dose-efficacy relationship.</header><p> recent publications (kasperlik-zaluska 2000; ahlman, khorram-manesh et al. 2001; baudin, pellegriti et al. 2001; favia, lumachi et al. 2001; heilmann, wagner et al. 2001) 
 stress the importance of monitoring the plasma levels of mitotane: they suggest that efficacy is 
 observed for plasma levels comprised between 14 and 20 mg/l. intolerance is more often observed 
 with the highest concentration (above 20mg/l). however, the dose-efficacy relationship is not so clear. 
 for instance, baudin et al. 2001 report that six out of 24 patients achieved the threshold therapeutic 
 plasma level of 14mg/l: four of these six patients had a response (though three only hormonal), but 8 
 out 11 patients given mitotane as adjuvant therapy had recurrences even though mitotane plasma level 
 was &gt;14mg/l in six of them.</p><p>
 the range of doses used in published studies is considerably wide (from 2 g to 19 g per day). in the 
 view of some authors, the highest tolerated dose is recommended, while other publications advocate 
 for a dosing schedule in the lower bound of the tested range (2-4 g/day). in any case, due to the high 
 affinity of mitotane for the fat tissue, the time to reach the proposed target plasma levels can be as 
 long as 3-5 months. the applicant should justify the selection of the 2-6 g/day dosing schedule and 
 how plasma drug levels should be monitored in order to get the proposed therapeutic window. this is 
 again of primary importance taking into account that monitoring of plasma levels of mitotane is not 
 available in many centres.</p><p>
 finally, with respect to plasma levels, some authors (haak, van seters et al. 1990; baudin, pellegriti et 
 al. 2001) questioned the bioavailability of some preparations used in clinical trials (e.g. enteric-coated</p><p>28/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 capsules) and suggest that tablets (as in the present application) may constitute the optimal form of administration.</p><p>
 in conclusion, this possible relationship reinforces the need of obtaining further knowledge on the 
 pharmacokinetic profile of mitotane, in order to define an optimal dosing schedule allowing for 
 reaching the mentioned therapeutic levels.</p></section><section><header>main study(ies)</header><p>the applicant has not conducted clinical efficacy and safety studies. the available clinical information on mitotane in adrenal carcinoma comes from published reports of uncontrolled studies.</p><p>
 for an update of clinical information, the applicant performed a search in medline, using 
 “mitotane” as the search term. a total of 220 articles were published after 1990. the clinical data 
 identified from these 220 references have been reviewed, taking into account that some publications 
 report the same series of patients at different follow-up stages. some of the publications also refer to 
 patients treated for cushing’s syndrome of other origin than adrenal carcinoma, e.g. adrenal bilateral 
 hyperplasia, benign adrenal tumours, or hypothalamic-pituitary cushing which are not the indications 
 claimed by the applicant. however, these publications were reviewed to seek possible information 
 related to safety of mitotane.</p><p>
 a number of publications have reported the clinical experience with mitotane for the treatment of 
 adrenocortical carcinoma. in the vast majority of the cases, these publications report retrospective 
 uncontrolled studies. it is not possible to sum up the total number of patients studied, since in several 
 of these publications patients previously reported were included. overall, these studies encompass 
 experience in more than 500 patients followed for various time periods. in most of the publications, 
 the actual formulation used for the treatment of patients is not reported.</p><p>
 the assessment of mitotane efficacy has the difficulties associated with an uncontrolled study design. 
 it differs from study to study, as efficacy was variably judged based on survival, on remission time, or 
 on tumour size reduction.</p><p>
 in addition, it was quite difficult to compare the results of the different studies, because most of them 
 are retrospective studies and there are various discrepancies between the series by different factors: the 
 stage of the disease (the response depends on the stage of the disease), the time of treatment initiation 
 (at the time of surgery or later), associated treatments, and dose regimen.</p><p>
 the table below summarises the most pertinent available clinical data published in the english, french 
 or german literature since 1990 in adults as identified by the bibliographic search as indicated above. 
 other publications are available in the literature but relate to series published before 1990 and have 
 not been included in this clinical overview since they did not bring additional information in terms of 
 efficacy or safety compared to the literature published since 1990. some of these publications indicate 
 that mitotane has been used in europe well before 10 years ago.</p><p>

 mitotane appeared to

 disease, such as inoperable adrenal carcinoma (metastases or recurrent local tumour) and the adjuvant 
 treatment at the time of surgery (prior to, or after surgery), both for adult and paediatric population. 
 no controlled prospective study evaluating the benefit of mitotane was published. in addition, in a 
 number of publications mitotane was initiated systematically at the time of surgery. the first approach 
 is confirmed by published review (libertino 1988). some articles are actually very critical in this 
 respect (khorram-manesh, ahlman et al. 1998) a vast review of 253 patients showing that mitotane 
 benefited only the group of patients not operated. moreover, an article not included in the marketing 
 authorisation application (vassilopoulou-sellin, guinee et al. 1993) does not support the conclusion 
 that adjuvant mitotane is beneficial in patients with localised or regional adrenocortical cancer: in this 
 study mitotane improved neither the disease-free interval nor survival.</p></section><section><header>effect on survival.</header><p> there are only few studies assessing the efficacy of mitotane on survival rates: in four studies (barzon, fallo et al. 1997; heilmann, wagner et al. 2001; icard, goudet et al. 2001; 
 vassilopoulou-sellin and schultz 2001) there was an increase in survival rate whereas in two 
 (pommier and brennan 1992; haak, hermans et al. 1994) no such improvement was reported. finally, 
 (vassilopoulou-sellin and schultz 2001) there was a non-significant (p=0.07) survival advantage, 
 which is defined as modest but has not been quantified; in any case the authors call for caution on this 
 finding due to possible selection bias of the treatment option. in five patients who had mitotane serum 
 levels ≥14mg/l, mean survival was longer than in those with lower drug plasma levels, which does not 
 necessarily prove that mitotane prolongs survival (heilmann, wagner et al. 2001). one publication 
 (barzon, fallo et al. 1997) reports that the survival rate observed in patients receiving mitotane in 
 association with chemotherapy was similar to that observed in patients given chemotherapy alone, and 
 significantly longer than in patients given mitotane alone. this suggests a possible interaction of 
 mitotane and chemotherapy. most of the studies report tumoral regressions or stabilisation of the 
 disease, and the percentage of responders varies widely from one study to another. it is stated a rate of 
 20 to 30 percent responders like a realistic estimate.</p><p>
 in their review of the literature on efficacy of mitotane, kopf et al. 2000 explained the various 
 discrepancies between the series by different factors: the stage of the disease, the time of treatment 
 initiation (at the time of surgery or later), associated treatments, and dose regimen. regarding the 
 latter, the applicant supported the existence of a dose-response relationship between mitotane level in 
 serum and survival (haak, hermans et al. 1994; kopf, goretzki et al. 2001). finally, therapeutic drug</p><p>33/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 monitoring may be helpful to target serum levels above 14 mg/l or even better above 20 mg/l if tolerance allows it, taking into account that side effects are dose-dependent.</p><p>
 in a retrospective series over 33 years from poland (kasperlik-zaluska 2000), 82 patients with adrenal 
 cortical carcinoma were treated with mitotane, 32 of them immediately after surgery, and 27 after a 
 delay of 2 to 24 months. at the time of publication, there were 18 survivors (56%) in the group treated 
 immediately after surgery, and 6 survivors (22%) in the other group.</p><p>
 in a retrospective study from the usa, mitotane was associated with a 24% response rate in patients 
 with metastatic or unresectable adrenal cortical carcinoma, with no clear-cut increase in survival time 
 (pommier and brennan 1992).</p><p>
 in a french large retrospective study (luton et al., 1990), mitotane was able to control hormonal 
 secretion in 75% of the patients. some patients had tumour stabilisation for up to 56 months and a few 
 (8 out 37 patients treated with mitotane) had tumour regression, a fact, which was never observed 
 among patients not treated with mitotane. overall, however, the effect of mitotane on survival was not 
 significant.</p></section><section><header>dosage recommendations.</header><p> as indicated in the above literature survey, the recommended dosage for adrenal carcinoma treatment varies from 8 to 12g/day in three divided doses. the time of treatment 
 initiation depends on the investigator but a number of studies suggest that treatment should be initiated 
 at the time of surgery for those patients undergoing surgical removal. daily dosage must be adapted in 
 function of the desired plasma levels: efficient plasma levels range between 14 and 20mg/l. plasma 
 levels above 20mg/l may be associated with severe side effects and bring no further therapeutic 
 advantage. in children, the recommended daily dose varies from 7 to 12g/m
 2/day. as in adults, plasma levels between 14 and 20mg/l may be desirable. this point appears to be in line with what has been 
 experienced in literature. however, the us product information for lysodren recommends starting 
 treatment at 2 to 6g per day and then increasing it incrementally up to 9 to 10g per day; if severe side 
 effects appear, the dose should then be reduced until the maximum tolerated dose is achieved. 
 experience has shown that the maximum tolerated dose in literature has been varying from 2 to 16g 
 per day, but has usually been 9 to 10g. it is true that based on the available literature data the time of 
 treatment initiation depends on the investigator, but the lack of scientific evidence on the best time to 
 commence therapy should further stress the need for more comprehensive testing of this product.</p></section><section><header>combination with chemotherapy.</header><p> the literature survey also provides some information on the use of mitotane in combination with other drugs used for controlling tumour growth: a variety of cytostatic 
 agents have been tried for the treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, 
 suramin, 5 fluorouracile and etoposide. interestingly, mitotane in combination with these agents may 
 increase their efficacy, a fact that is related to the finding that mitotane is able to reverse 
 in vitro multidrug resistance (dogliotti, berruti et al. 1995; berruti, terzolo et al. 1998). streptozocin in combination with mitotane has also been found to have some effect on disease-free interval in patients 
 with adrenal cortical carcinoma (khan, imam et al. 2000). a prospective us study evaluating the 
 efficacy of mitotane combined with cisplatin in 37 evaluable patients with metastatic or residual ac 
 concluded that the combination could be efficient (bukowski, wolfe et al. 1993). however, another 
 recent prospective study in the usa (williamson, lew et al. 2000) has shown that combining cisplatin 
 and etoposide for adrenal cortical carcinoma (local or metastasised disease) had minimal activity and 
 that adding mitotane (4g/day) without plasma level monitoring led to an objective response in only 2 
 out of 16 evaluable patients. conversely, a patient with liver metastasis of an adrenal cortical 
 carcinoma was followed for 11 months while on mitotane with only minimal response and marked 
 gastro-intestinal side effects. mitotane was discontinued and replaced by cisplatin and etoposide, 
 which induced a &gt;50 % reduction in metastasis size (zidan, shpendler et al. 1996). in a french 
 evaluation of etoposide and cisplatin in combination with mitotane (at doses resulting in plasma levels 
 &gt;14mg/l) in 18 patients with advanced adrenal cortical carcinoma</p><p>(bonacci, gigliotti et al. 1998), the 
 treatment resulted in a complete response in 3 cases and in a partial response in 3 cases. tolerance was 
 acceptable and no treatment interruption was required. a japanese report suggests that combining 
 mitotane with tegafur was also an option for the treatment of metastatic adrenal carcinoma</p><p>(nakamura, 
 kuzuya et al. 1990). berruti et al. (berruti, terzolo et al. 1998), the authors concluded that the</p><p>34/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 combination of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin (edp) with mitotane “appeared active and manageable”, that compared with edp alone “some additional side effects due to mitotane 
 concomitant medication, such as neurotoxicity and hyperlipidemia, were observed” and that this 
 “combination regimen should be further explored with a larger series of patients”. other authors 
 concluded (khan, imam et al. 2000)that the combination of streptozocin and mitotane “needs further 
 evaluation with larger patient materials in randomised trials”. finally (bukowski, wolfe et al. 1993), 
 the authors of study conclude that the combination of cisplatin and mitotane “seems to have modest 
 antitumor activity” and consider that while “it is unclear whether the addition of mitotane increased 
 the effectiveness of cisplatin, certainly the combination seems to have had additive toxicity. 
 substantial neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicity occurred during the study and led to premature 
 discontinuation of therapy in 47% of patients”. in conclusion, the literature seems to agree that larger 
 randomised trials are required to appropriately test the safety and efficacy of mitotane in combination 
 with other chemotherapy agents. certainly, there is no consensus on the efficacy of mitotane in 
 combination with other agents for the treatment of patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma.</p></section><section><header>clinical studies in special populations</header><p>the only available information about the use of mitotane in special populations refers to children. other groups such as elderly, patients with hepatic or renal impairment or others are not considered in 
 this clinical dossier.</p></section><section><header>children.</header><p> as in adults, adrenal cortical carcinoma in children is a very severe tumor: disease-free interval is approximately 9 months but regional disease at presentation is associated with a shorter 
 disease-free interval (approximately 3 months). mitotane treatment after excision may be associated 
 with a longer survival. the dose usually reported varies from 7 to 12g/m
 2/day. however, data in children are very limited and, as indicated in their reviews, ribeiro et al. (ribeiro, michalkiewicz et al. 
 2000) and teinturier et al. (teinturier, pauchard et al. 1999) conclude that the role of mitotane for the 
 treatment of childhood ac has not be established in comparative trials. however, there are some 
 reports that, as in adults, mitotane treatment may be associated with prolonged remissions (godil, 
 atlas et al. 2000; ciftci, senocak et al. 2001). other authors (ciftci, senocak et al. 2001) did not find a 
 significant effect of mitotane on survival rate and conclude that these patients “should be entered into 
 multi-institutional trials to assess adequately effective chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols”. in a 
 case report (godil, atlas et al. 2000), the authors while acknowledging that their case responded well 
 to mitotane therapy conceded that improved survival with mitotane is controversial in pediatric 
 patients.</p><p>
 in conclusion, like in adults adrenal cortical carcinoma in children is a very severe tumour: disease-
 free interval is approximately 9 months but regional disease at presentation is associated with a shorter 
 disease-free interval (approximately 3 months). data in children are very limited and two reviews 
 (teinturier, pauchard et al. 1999; ribeiro, michalkiewicz et al. 2000) conclude that the role of 
 mitotane for the treatment of childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma has not be established in 
 comparative trials. however there are some reports that showed, as in adults, that mitotane treatment 
 might be associated with prolonged remissions.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>adrenal carcinoma is a rare disease with no curative treatment when surgery is impossible or has failed; therefore further therapeutic options are needed for this patient population. mitotane has been 
 used for decades in many countries, including in europe on a compassionate basis, for the treatment of 
 inoperable adrenal carcinoma and it seems to constitute the main therapeutic option in such cases (see 
 also well-established used justification). different cytotoxic agents have also been used in the 
 treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, suramin, 5 fluorouracil and 
 etoposide, with questionable efficacy results and considerable higher toxicity.</p><p>
 no prospective comparative study assessing efficacy and safety of mitotane in a well-defined protocol 
 has been carried out. the clinical dossier included in this application consists on published studies of 
 poor quality. most of them are retrospective case-series with mitotane being evaluated as palliative</p><p>35/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 therapy in advanced stages or as adjuvant treatment to surgery. the series of cases provided in the literature review data on the use of mitotane inlude an extremely heterogeneous population in terms of 
 disease stage, objective of the therapeutic intervention (adjuvant to surgery or palliative treatment in 
 non-surgical population), associated treatments, and dose regimen. due to the nature of the published 
 literature, there is no information for the existing data on how gcp were followed. the evidence 
 concerning the clinical efficacy of mitotane can be summarised as follows:</p></section><section><header>efficacy of mitotane in advanced adrenal cortical carcinoma.</header><p>some publications suggest that mitotane administration can provide some benefit in patients with non-resectable or metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma.</p><p>
 in two papers (haak, hermans et al. 1994; barzon, fallo et al. 1997) where mitotane (lysodren for all 
 patients in the study conducted by haak et al.) has been studied as a true “adjuvant” treatment, there 
 was no clear-cut evidence that mitotane can increase the disease-free interval and delay the onset of 
 recurrence. it is noteworthy that reference (haak, hermans et al. 1994) is a prospective evaluation of 
 lysodren either as a treatment of unresectable adrenal carcinoma, or as an adjuvant treatment, with 
 monitoring of plasma levels of mitotane: the authors found an obvious effect of lysodren on survival 
 and tumour regression for unresectable tumours (see below) and no effect when used as an adjuvant 
 treatment: it is therefore unlikely that a further trial will show a positive adjuvant effect unless new 
 prognostic factors appear in the future to select potential responders or new means to detect 
 micrometastases become available.</p><p>
 therefore, the cpmp considered that the indication should be restricted to 
 unresectable adrenal carcinoma</p><p>(i.e. no possible surgical removal of tumour or metastases, or incomplete removal of tumour and/or metastases).</p></section><section><header>effect on survival.</header><p>mitotane appears to prolong the survival of those patients whose tumours regress. there have been reports of a few patients who achieved complete remissions with long-term survival (greater than 5 
 years), although this finding does not mean that the prolonged survival is related to mitotane response. 
 the published data do not provide sufficient evidence to support any effect of mitotane on survival.</p></section><section><header>tumour regression.</header><p>most of the studies report tumoral regressions or stabilisation of the disease, and the percentage of responders varies widely from one study to another. it should also be noted that an important number 
 of studies have not been assessed using the usual response criteria. a rate of 20 to 30 percent 
 responders is suggested as a realistic estimate (mainly either partial or just a slight reduction of tumour 
 size). this might not be substantially different from the response rate observed with chemotherapy 
 (mainly platinum-based regimens), but with a considerably better tolerability profile. although no 
 comparative trials exist assessing the effect of mitotane on adrenal cortical carcinoma in terms of 
 objective responses and a study has yet to be conducted with modern imaging techniques and response 
 criteria accepted by clinical oncologists, the irremediably progressive nature of the disease makes that 
 any tumour regression obtained after a therapeutic intervention can be considered as a proof of effect 
 (at least some effect) on the objective response. it is difficult to determine whether the magnitude and 
 duration of this anti-tumour effect is comparable to that obtained with conventional chemotherapeutic 
 agents. the heterogeneity of the regimens used (although cisplatin based regimens are the most 
 commonly used) and the stage of the disease when therapy is started make unfeasible making a sound 
 indirect comparison between both strategies. however, and according to the expert view, the 
 following aspects favours the choice of mitotane in front of chemotherapy with conventional agents: 
 - 
 if existing, the differences in response rate and duration of response between both regimens 
 must be considered as clinically irrelevant. 
 - 
 none of the regimens have demonstrated that the anti-tumour effect is associated with an 
 improvement in survival or an increased disease-free interval.</p><p>36/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 - the toxicity profile of conventional chemotherapy is considerably higher and the acceptability 
 by the patients much lower. 
 - 
 last, but not least, the anti-hormonal effects of mitotane allow for a better symptomatic control 
 of the patients (see below)</p></section><section><header>subjective response.</header><p> this is an issue of extreme importance in this advanced population with such a fatal prognosis. clinical effectiveness consists on reducing weakness, anorexia, pain (when present) 
 and symptoms and, in functional tumours, signs and symptoms related to excessive steroid production.</p><p>
 although the data provided show a variable effect of mitotane on the control of symptoms, it has been 
 reported that it may induce a transitory return (lasting from few weeks to several months) of hormonal 
 findings to normal levels in up to 75% of patients. in any case, treatment is never curative, and tumour 
 regression is transient. on the literature reports (and also in the view of the expert) the effect of 
 mitotane on the control of symptoms is higher than that observed with conventional chemotherapy. 
 this apparent difference is specially marked in (but not limited to) functional adrenal cortical 
 carcinoma tumours inducing a constellation of clinical pictures that significantly impair patient’s 
 quality of life (cushing syndrome, virilisation, feminisation and hyperaldosteronism).</p></section><section><header>efficacy of mitotane as adjuvant therapy in adrenal cortical carcinoma.</header><p>mitotane has been used as an adjunct following surgery removal of the primary tumour in a limited number of patients in order to delay or prevent recurrent disease. some of the publications provided by 
 the applicant suggest that mitotane as adjunctive therapy might be associated with an improved 
 survival. however, available evidence (and also corroborated by the wide range of publications on this 
 issue) suggests that its value as an adjunct to surgery has not been adequately investigated in an 
 efficacy and safety study and cannot be considered as proven.</p></section><section><header>efficacy of mitotane in children.</header><p>the prognosis of adrenocortical carcinoma always is guarded. sporadic cures have been reported in patients who underwent complete removal of a small (&lt;9 cm) encapsulated tumour. reports of 
 remission of metastatic disease are only anecdotal. more aggressive surgical approaches have led to an 
 expansion of mean survival time of approximately 18 months to occasionally longer than 48 months. 
 few studies of aggressive surgery and early adjuvant therapy are available. in this application, there 
 are not enough data to assess the use of mitotane in children. there are no reasons to think that the role 
 of mitotane in the treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma in children might be substantially different 
 than the one for adults (palliative therapy in inoperable adrenal cortical carcinoma). however, as no 
 clear peak incidence according to age has been described, the applicant should, on the basis of 
 available data, further elaborate on the potential usefulness and limitations of use of mitotane as well 
 as the potential need for different dosing schedules according to age strata. in conclusion, the efficacy 
 in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established and, at present only very limited data are 
 available in this age group.</p><p>
 there are published data suggesting that assaying mitotane levels during therapy is valuable because 
 its therapeutic efficacy depends on achieving serum levels of at least 14 mg/l and below 20 mg/l. the 
 proposed treatment schedule is as follows: start at doses between 3 and 6 g of lysodren per day given 
 in three divided doses. monitoring the plasma level of mitotane is advisable in order to target the 
 therapeutic level which is 14 mg/l or above: experience indicates that such level can be reached when 
 the patient has received a cumulative amount of 75 g lysodren. after such exposure to lysodren, 
 plasma mitotane levels may need to be monitored at biweekly intervals. levels higher than 20 mg/l 
 may be associated with severe undesirable effects and offer no further benefit in terms of efficacy. 
 when levels of 14 mg/l or above are reached, lysodren dose should be reduced in order to maintain 
 plasma levels in the desired range, taking into account that levels may still raise despite dose 
 reduction, necessitating in some cases temporary lysodren interruption. experience with lysodren 
 indicates that maintenance doses of 1–2 g per day may be sufficient to maintain the patient at the 
 desired target dose. data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with food 
 and/or oil can enhance absorption.</p><p>37/45</p><p>
 emea 2005</p><p>therefore in the light of the published data mitotane may be beneficial for patients unable to undergo complete resection of the tumour. an estimated 80% of the patients with functioning tumours and 
 treated with mitotane will show a substantial diminution in hormone production. in metastatic 
 adrenocortical carcinoma, temporary palliation of disseminated adrenocortical carcinomas can 
 sometimes be achieved. although measurable partial remissions are unusual and are reported in 20 to 
 30% of cases, excellent palliation of hormone symptoms is commonly observed. therefore, mitotane 
 is clinically beneficial for the symptomatic treatment of patients with advanced (unresectable, 
 metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma. there does not appear to be a role for mitotane as 
 adjuvant therapy if the patient has undergone complete resection of the tumour.</p><p>
 the efficacy in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established and, at present only very 
 limited data are available in this age group.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>the information concerning the clinical safety of mitotane provided by the applicant was extracted from the published literature, from a five years periodic safety update report covering the period 
 from 8 july 1997 to 7 july 2002 and from the us product information for lysodren (primarily on the 
 initial new drug approval application submitted to the fda in 1969).</p></section><section><header>patient exposure</header><p>some data on exposure are available in the scientific literature, however these data suffer most likely from an important underreporting of the true number of patients being treated with mitotane in the eu 
 or worldwide. in the periodic safety update report covering the period from 8 july 1997 to 7 july 
 2002.in this report the mah made the assumptions that all patients are adults with normal hepatic 
 function receiving mitotane for inoperable adrenal cortical carcinoma, each patient receives 10 grams 
 daily for 365 days (which is a high daily dose of mitotane). based on these assumptions and based on 
 the bulk woldwide sales, the applicant estimated that slightly more than 1,700 patients were treated 
 during one year over the period covered by the periodic safety update report. these data should be 
 taken with caution since the bulk worldwide sales figures were an underestimate of the total quantity 
 actually sold. an estimate of the number of patients liable to benefit from a treatment with mitotane 
 was calculated in the well-established use justification of this report.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse reactions/deaths/other significant reactions1</header><p>in most of the clinical studies analysed, side effects were reported with few comments, since they were expected from previous experience obtained with lysodren mostly in the usa.</p><p> 
 1 in this report, the terms adverse drug reactions and adverse events are used according to the current eu legislation. an adverse drug reaction is defined by a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
 unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease 
 or for the restoration, correction or modification of physiological function. a reaction, contrary to an event, is 
 characterised by the fact that a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence is suspected. an adverse 
 event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. finally, the term “severe” is not 
 synonymous with serious. severe is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
 moderate or severe). the safety profile of mitotane is described according to the meddra system organ classes 
 or meddra terminology.</p><p>frequencies are expressed according to the eu guideline on summary of product characteristics (report from cioms working group iii, geneva 1995 terminology) very common (&gt;1/10) common 
 (&gt;1/100, &lt;1/10) uncommon (&gt;1/1,000, &lt;1/100) rare (&gt;1/10,000, &lt;1/1,000) very rare (&lt;1/10,000), 
 including isolated reports.</p><p>38/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 a very high percentage of patients (more than 80 percent) treated with lysodren have shown at least one type of undesirable effect. the drug discontinuations due to side effects are not described in the 
 dossier. 
 the most frequently observed adverse reactions consist of gastrointestinal, neurological and skin 
 reactions.</p><p>
 gastro-intestinal disorders: gastrointestinal disturbances, which consist of anorexia, nausea or 
 vomiting, and in some cases diarrhoea, occur in about 80% of the patients. the thresholds for gastro-
 intestinal and neuropsychological toxicities have been reported to be about 5mg/l and 15 mg/l 
 respectively. moreover, plasma concentration monitoring can be difficult for a substance with such 
 long elimination half-life and extensive distribution, as the time period before a change in dose will 
 have an impact on plasma concentration will be very long.</p><p>
 nervous system disorders: adverse reactions affecting the central nervous system occur in 40% of the 
 patients. these consist primarily of depression as manifested by lethargy and somnolence (25%) and 
 dizziness or vertigo (15%). at high doses and after prolonged utilisation, brain function impairment 
 can occur which, however, appears reversible at treatment cessation. therefore, behavioural and 
 neurological assessments should be made at regular intervals when continuous lysodren treatment 
 exceeds 2 years. in addition, since sedation, lethargy, vertigo, and other central nervous system side 
 effects can occur so, ambulatory patients should be cautioned about driving, operating machinery, and 
 other hazardous pursuits requiring mental and physical alertness. the monitoring of mitotane plasma 
 levels may help at preventing the neurological toxicity if the plasma levels are maintained below 
 20 mg/l.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: skin toxicity has been observed in about 15% of the cases. 
 the skin changes consist primarily of transient skin rashes, which do not seem to be dose related. in 
 some instances, this side effect subsided while the patients were maintained on the drug without a 
 change of dose.</p><p>
 in addition, the us product information for lysodren lists a series of less common adverse reactions 
 involving:</p><p>
 eye disorders: visual blurring, diplopia, lens opacity, toxic retinopathy;</p><p>
 renal and urinary disorders: hematuria, haemorrhagic cystitis, and albuminuria;</p><p>
 cardiac disorders: hypertension, or orthostatic hypotension, and flushing;</p><p>
 the us product information for lysodren is based primarily on the initial new drug approval 
 application. the following table summarises the side effect profile reported in this application among

 other adverse drug reactions are listed in the us product information for lysodren. these reactions 
 are: transient weakness, baldness, increased pain, epigastric gnawing, nosebleed, sore tongue, loose 
 stools, dry mouth and lips, hypertension, yellow facial pigment, osteoporosis, lack of memory, weight 
 loss, possible esophagitis, tinnitus, blurred vision, postural hypotension, posterior polar cataracts, 
 abdominal cramps, hot flashes, fever, irritability, enuresis, drowsiness.</p><p>
 the most frequently reported side effects in the published literature are gastro-intestinal disorders 
 (nausea, vomiting) and nervous system disorders (ataxia, somnolence, lethargy, dysarthria, vertigo, 
 mental deterioration), myasthenia.</p><p>
 the articles published in the scientific literature indicate that some undesirable effects appear to be 
 dose – dependent and their incidence and severity can be decreased with a reduction of the daily dose. 
 some of them (including the neurological disturbances and mental retardation) seem to be reversible 
 after treatment discontinuation (bollen and lanser 1992). the recent availability of a plasma assay of 
 mitotane and its metabolites (dickstein, shechner et al. 1998) may allow a more precise determination 
 of the active dose: additional clinical data (terzolo, pia et al. 2000; baudin, pellegriti et al. 2001) 
 indicate that the appropriate serum mitotane level is about 14 mg/l and that serum levels above 
 20 mg/l may induce adverse reactions. appropriate serum levels may be achieved with lower daily 
 doses of mitotane (2 to 3 g/daily), and some reports suggest that monitoring the plasma levels of 
 mitotane leads to lower daily administration, hence a better tolerance of lysodren (khorram-manesh, 
 ahlman et al. 1998; terzolo, pia et al. 2000; baudin, pellegriti et al. 2001; heilmann, wagner et al. 
 2001; ilias, alevizaki et al. 2001).</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>mitotane reversibly increases the blood level of hormone-binding proteins (shbg, tbg, cbg and vitamin d-binding protein) (van seters and moolenaar 1991). the mechanism of this phenomenon is 
 not clear but may involve estrogen excess, leading to feminising phenomena (e.g. gynecomastia) 
 observed during mitotane treatment. this finding has practical consequences: total serum hormone 
 levels cannot be used as the only parameter to monitor the effects of mitotane on endocrine function.</p><p>40/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 this is especially relevant for the monitoring of cortisol substitution that therefore requires measurements of free cortisol and acth levels. in this respect, a literature report (hague, may et al. 
 1989) indicates the occurrence of adrenal crisis in two patients treated with mitotane requiring the use 
 of high amount of steroid substitution. these adrenal crises were associated with evidence of liver 
 enzyme induction (shortening of antipyrine half-life during mitotane treatment), which may have 
 played an important role in the occurrence of the steroid resistance. a substantial percentage of the 
 patients treated show signs of adrenal insufficiency. it therefore appears necessary to institute steroid 
 replacement in those patients. since lysodren increases plasma level of steroid binding proteins, free 
 cortisol and acth determinations are necessary for optimal dosing of steroid substitution.</p><p>
 liver function tests nos abnormal: the hepatotoxicity of mitotane has been reviewed (neuman, 
 bruckert et al. 2001) in a retrospective review of 10 patients with cushing syndrome (no patient had 
 an adrenal carcinoma in this series), after a mean dose of 9 g per day. in all patients a raise of plasma 
 cholesterol was noted. before treatment, 3 patients had an increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase 
 (alat). during treatment all patients had an increase of either alanine aminotransferase (alat) or 
 gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-gt), or both. the maximum increase was 6 times the upper 
 normal value, for mean doses of approximately 9 grams per day. the increase was detected after 2 
 weeks on treatment in 4 patients, and within 4 months in the others. treatment discontinuation led to 
 normalisation within 4 months to one year. no case of liver failure were reported.</p><p>
 blood and the lymphatic system disorders: cases of leucopenia, decrease in leucocytes, platelets or 
 erythrocytes were reported in some patients without any conclusion as to whether or not these effects 
 are related to mitotane, or to the underlying disease of the patients. a reversible pancytopenia has been 
 reported in a patient treated by mitotane (3g/day) for a paraneoplastic cushing’s syndrome (andres, 
 vinzio et al. 2001).</p><p>
 hypercholesterolaemia (hdl) has been reported during mitotane treatment (vassilopoulou-sellin and 
 samaan 1991; maher, trainer et al. 1992; gebhardt, moolenaar et al. 1993). the proposed mechanism 
 of action is a blockade of cytochrome p450-mediated reactions leading to a down-regulation of 
 hepatic cholesterol synthesis. the use of cholesterol-synthesis inhibitors (statins) reverses this effect 
 and can be proposed in association with mitotane treatment.</p></section><section><header>safety in special populations</header><p>no specific data addressing the safety of mitotane in children were included in the marketing authorisation application. however, based on the safety profile of the product observed in adults and 
 based on the information included in the us product information for lysodren, the summary of 
 product characteristics for lysodren states that neuro-psychological retardation may be observed 
 during mitotane treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a 
 possible thyroid impairment linked to mitotane treatment. 
 ηypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed during mitotane treatment.</p></section><section><header>safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</header><p>spironolactone: mitotane should not be given in combination with spironolactone since this product may block the action of mitotane. this association is contra-indicated.</p><p>
 warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: mitotane has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of warfarin by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in 
 dosage requirements for warfarin. therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change 
 in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-like 
 anticoagulants.</p><p>
 substances metabolised through cytochrome p450: mitotane has been shown to have an inductive effect on cytochrome p450 enzymes. therefore the plasma concentrations of the products metabolised 
 via cytochrome p450</p><p>may be modified. in the absence of information on the specific p450 isoenzymes</p><p>41/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 involved, caution should be taken when coprescribing active substances metabolised by this route such as, among others, anticonvulsants, rifabutin, rifampicin, griseofulvin and st. john’s wort (
 hypericum perforatum
 ).</p><p>
 mitotane can give rise to central nervous system undesirable effects at high concentrations (see section 
 4.8). although no specific information on pharmacodynamic interactions in the central nervous system 
 is available, this should be borne in mind when coprescribing medicinal products with central nervous 
 system depressant action.</p></section><section><header>post marketing experience</header><p>finally, the five-year periodic safety update report covers the period from 8 july 1997 to 7 july 2002 from bristol – myers – squibb submitted to the regulatory authorities of the third countries where 
 lysodren is authorised was included in the marketing authorisation application for lysodren. the 
 conclusion of this document is that during the period covered by the report of the update, no 
 previously unrecognised adverse reaction has been identified and that no change of the safety section 
 of the summary of product characteristics for lysodren or patient information leaflet was warranted.</p><p>
 five severe adverse reactions were reported in the eu (one in germany and four in the uk) where 
 lysodren is available on a compassionate basis and four cases came from countries where lysodren is 
 approved (3 cases in the usa and one in canada).</p><p>
 there were two cases of death: both were related to the progression of the underlying adrenal 
 carcinoma and none appeared related to mitotane.</p><p>
 the severe reactions occurring in 4 patients were reported during the period covered by the periodic 
 safety update report. these cases are the following: death (2 cases), adrenocortical carcinoma 
 (1 case), neoplasm progression (1 case), anaemia (1 case), hyponatremia (1 case), diarrhoea (1 case),

 ______________________________________________________________________</p><p>although no conclusion can be drawn from the present safety periodic update report regarding the relationship between dose of mitotane and occurrence of adverse events, literature indicates that some 
 side effects appear to be dose-dependent and their occurrence and/or severity may be decreased when 
 decreasing the daily dose.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>regarding safety aspects, the severity of inoperable or relapsing adrenal cortical carcinoma could justify the use of a product that can induce clinically significant undesirable effects in a high 
 proportion of patients (nore than 80%). the most frequently observed adverse reactions consist of 
 gastrointestinal, neurological toxicities and cutaneous reactions. in addition, as outlined above, the 
 availability of plasma measurements of mitotane could help prescribers to target the optimal 
 therapeutic plasma levels (14 – 20 mg/l) and thus avoid the risk of serious adverse reactions which are 
 dose-related and are usually observed when plasma mitotane levels are above 20 mg/l. hepatic 
 reactions were reported and may be reversible when treatment is discontinued.</p><p>
 mitotane is contraindicated in combination with spironolactone. mitotane has been reported to 
 accelerate the metabolism of warfarin by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, 
 leading to an increase in dosage requirements for warfarin. therefore, physicians should closely 
 monitor patients for a change in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to 
 patients on coumarin-like anticoagulants.</p><p>43/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 no specific data addressing the safety of mitotane in children were included in the marketing authorisation application. neuro-psychological retardation may be observed during mitotane 
 treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid 
 impairment linked to mitotane treatment. growth retardation may be also observed during mitotane 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
  
 quality</header><p>at the time of the cpmp opinion, a number of quality issues were not completely resolved, particularly in the context of in vitro control measures necessary to provide a comfortable margin of 
 confidence concerning the satisfactory and reproducible bioavailability of mitotane from this product, 
 from batch to batch. 
 on balance, the cpmp has reached their opinion on the basis of an ‘overall’ benefit/risk balance, 
 taking into account the clinical usefulness of this product in the proposed indication, and accepting 
 that some quality deficiencies have not been fully resolved at the time of the opinion. consequently 
 the applicant has been required to give a commitment to resolve these outstanding quality concerns 
 within a defined timeframe, as post-opinion followup measures.</p></section><section><header>non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>non-clinical data on the general toxicity of mitotane is limited. reproductive toxicity studies indicate that ddt and other polychlorinated biphenyl analogues are recognised to have deleterious effects on 
 fertility, pregnancy and development, and mitotane could be expected to share these properties. the 
 genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of mitotane have not been investigated. the administration of 
 mitotane is contraindicated in case of breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic active substance, although it can cause adrenal inhibition, apparently without cellular destruction. its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown. data are available to 
 suggest that mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing 
 the adrenal cortex. the administration of mitotane alters the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol in 
 man, leading to a reduction in measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroids, even though plasma levels of 
 corticosteroids do not fall. mitotane apparently causes increased formation of 6-β-hydroxyl 
 cholesterol.</p><p>
 mitotane has not been studied in a clinical therapeutic program. available clinical information comes 
 mainly from published data in patients with inoperable or metastatic adrenal carcinoma. in terms of 
 overall survival, four studies conclude that mitotane treatment does not increase the survival rate 
 whereas five find an increase in the survival rate. among the latter, three studies find such an increase 
 only in patients in whom plasma mitotane is above 14 mg/l. in terms of total or partial tumour and/or 
 metastasis regression, eleven studies have shown some degree of improvement and sometimes-
 occasional prolonged remissions. however, in several studies, the objective criteria for evaluating 
 tumour response are missing or not reported. there are nevertheless some studies, which provide 
 accurate information on tumour regression or disappearance and demonstrate that the threshold of 14 
 mg/l appears necessary to induce an objective tumour regression. in addition, mitotane induces a state 
 of adrenal insufficiency, which leads to the disappearance of cushing syndrome in patients with 
 secreting adrenal carcinoma, and necessitates substitution hormonotherapy.</p><p>paediatric population: the efficacy in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established and, at present only very limited data are available in this age group. clinical information comes mainly 
 from a large retrospective trial in children (median age, 4 years) who had an unresectable primary 
 tumor or who presented a tumor recurrence or a metastasic disease; most of the children (75%) 
 presented with endocrine symptoms. mitotane was given alone or combined with chemotherapy with</p><p>44/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 various agents. overall, the disease-free interval was 7 months (2 to 16 months). there were recurrences in 40% of children; the survival rate at 5 years was 49%.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>regarding safety aspects, the severity of inoperable or relapsing adrenal cortical carcinoma could justify the use of a product that can induce clinically significant undesirable effects in a high

 treatment.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>the three main questions concerning the clinical efficacy of mitotane were discussed on 17 november 2003 after the cpmp proposed to consult the therapeutic advisory group in oncology. 
 three main questions related to the indication of mitotane, the possible existence of a 
 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship and the relevance of the post-authorisation 
 commitments.</p><p>
 on the basis of the experience of use and published data, the cpmp asked the tag to discuss the 
 possible effect of mitotane in the symptomatic treatment of patients with advanced (unresectable, 
 metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma and a possible limitation of the effect to those 
 patients with functional tumours. the tag considered that on the basis of published data that 
 mitotane has a clinically relevant effect in the symptomatic treatment of patients with advanced (i.e. 
 unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma. in addition, the majority of patients 
 (an estimated 70%) suffer from a functional adrenal cortical carcinoma. however, the tag considered 
 that a beneficial effect could be expected in all patients with advanced adrenal cortical carcinoma 
 whether the tumour is functional or not. therefore, the product should be indicated in the treatment of 
 patients with advanced (i.e. unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma without 
 distinction whether the tumour is functional or not.</p><p>
 the tag was asked to discuss the proposal for dosing mitotane. the tag considered that this 
 therapeutic monitoring of plasma levels is pertinent and should be reflected in the summary of product 
 characteristics for lysodren. however, the tag emphasised that the availability of a monitoring of 
 plasma level is not a mandatory monitoring to treat and monitor the patients with advanced (i.e. 
 unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma. on the basis of the experience of use 
 of mitotane, the monitoring of plasma level of mitotane may help the practitioners to administer higher 
 starting doses (4 – 6 g/day) of mitotane and achieve the desired effective plasma levels of the product 
 (estimated to be approximately 14 mg/l) more rapidly than in the situation where this monitoring is 
 not conducted. therefore, the therapeutic advisory group considered that this monitoring should be 
 mentioned in the “special warnings and special precautions for use” of the summary of product 
 characteristics for lysodren and should be recommended when a high starting dose of mitotane (i.e. 6</p><p>45/45</p><p>
 emea 2005 g/day) is given to the patients. if such monitoring is unavailable lower starting doses of mitotane should be recommended (3-4 g/day). on the basis of the experience of use of mitotane the tag stated 
 that there might be a relationship between high plasma levels of mitotane (above 20 mg/l) and the 
 occurrence of neurological toxicity. therefore a monitoring of plasma levels of mitotane may help to 
 prevent the occurrence of this neurological toxicity. the tag considered again, that this should be 
 reflected in the summary of product characteristics for lysodren.</p><p>
 finally, the tag was requested to discuss the adequacy and feasibility of the studies the applicant 
 committed to perform once a marketing authorisation may be granted. the tag considered that the 
 applicant should perform the prospective evaluation of mitotane and should conduct (at least) two 
 prospective studies. the first one should be a prospective evaluation of lysodren in the target 
 population to characterise the pharmacokinetic properties of the product. in addition, the tag 
 considered that the applicant should conduct a second prospective study (in the form of a prospective 
 registry for example) in patients treated with mitotane to better characterise the relationship between 
 the plasma levels and the occurrence of a neurological toxicity. considering the incidence of adrenal 
 cortical carcinoma (two new cases per million per year, meaning that up to 30 to 40 new patients may 
 be treated with lysodren a year in the eu) the tag considered that such study could be completed 
 within 3 to 4 years.</p></section><section><header>recommendation</header><p>based on the cpmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the cpmp considered by majority decision</p><p>that the benefit/risk profile of lysodren was favourable in the treatment of adrenal cortical 
 carcinoma.</p></section></body></xml>
