 patients prescribed thelin, any adverse reactions and reasons for discontinuation of thelin. details of 
 such a surveillance programme should be agreed with the national competent authorities in each 
 member state and put in place prior to marketing of the product.
 the mah must agree the details of a controlled distribution system with the national competent 
 authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that, prior to prescribing, all 
 doctors who intend to prescribe thelin are provided with a physician information pack containing the 
 following:
 product informationphysician information about thelinpatient information cardpartner of patient information cardthe physician information about thelin should contain the following key elements:
 that thelin is teratogenicouse of effective contraception in women of child bearing ageopossible interaction with oral contraceptives and increased risk of thromboembolismoneed to advise female patients about teratogenicity, contraception, if necessary the need for pregnancy testing and what to do if they become pregnant
 oreferral of patients who become pregnant to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology and its diagnosis for evaluation and advice
 that thelin is hepatotoxiconeed for liver function tests prior to and during treatmentocontraindication in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a-c).
 ocontraindication in patients with elevated direct bilirubin</p><p>&gt; 2 x uln prior to initiation of treatment.
 oneed for close monitoring if liver enzymes measure &gt; 3 × upper limit normal (uln): &gt; 3 and ≤ 5 × uln: confirm by another liver test; if confirmed, a decision should be made on an individual basis to continue or to stop thelin administration. 
 continue to monitor aminotransferases at least every 2 weeks.</p><p>if the 
 aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values consider resuming the 
 initial treatment schedule.
 &gt; 5 and ≤ 8 × uln: confirm by another liver test; if confirmed, stop treatment and monitor aminotransferase levels at least every 2 weeks until levels have 
 normalised.</p><p>if the aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values, 
 reintroducing thelin may be considered.
 &gt; 8 x uln: treatment must be stopped and reintroduction of thelin is not to be considered. 
 that treatment with thelin often causes a decrease in haemoglobin and related red cell parametersoneed for full blood count prior to use and monitoring at clinically appropriate intervalseffect of thelin on bleedingointeraction with warfarin and vitamin k antagonists leading to an increased inroneed to decrease established dose of vitamin k antagonist upon starting sitaxentan therapy
 ostart vitamin k antagonists treatment at a reduced dose if already on sitaxentan sodiumoneed for regular monitoring of inrobe aware of the potential for haemorrhage and investigate as appropriate3oincreased risk of epistaxis and gingival bleedingthat there is an interaction with ciclosporin a which may lead to higher blood concentration of thelin and hence an increased risk of adverse reactions.
 that the safety database of thelin is limited and physicians are encouraged to enrol patients in a surveillance programme to increase knowledge about the incidence of important adverse drug 
 reactions (adrs). the surveillance programme should prompt doctors to report serious adrs and 
 certain selected adrs as below immediately and other non-serious adrs at three monthly 
 intervals. 
 the information collected should include:
 oanonymised patient details – age, sex and aetiology of pahoconcomitant medicationsoreason for discontinuationoadrsoall serious adrsoincrease in hepatic enzymes to &gt; 3 × ulnoelevated direct bilirubin &gt; 2 × ulnoanaemiaohaemorrhageopregnancy and outcomeopulmonary oedema (associated with veno-occlusive disease)osuspected interactionsounexpected adrs according to the spc.the patient information card should include the following information
 that thelin is teratogenicthe need to ensure that women of child bearing age are using effective contraception and that patients should inform their doctors of any possibility of pregnancy before a new prescription is 
 issued
 the need for female patients to contact their treating doctor immediately if they suspect that they might be pregnant.
 that thelin is hepatotoxic and they will need to attend for regular blood teststhe need to tell their doctor about any adverse eventsthe need to tell their doctor that they are taking thelinpartner of patient information card should include the following information:
 that thelin is teratogenic and that women of child bearing age must use effective contraception</p></section></body></xml>
