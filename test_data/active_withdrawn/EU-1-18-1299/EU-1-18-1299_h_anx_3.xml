 posology</p><p>
 yescarta is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a single dose of yescarta contains 2 x 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (or maximum of 2 x 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 ml dispersion in an infusion bag.</p><p>
 the availability of yescarta must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen.</p><p>
 pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) • a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenous and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenous should be administered on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before infusion of yescarta.</p><p>
 pre-medication • paracetamol 500-1,000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 25 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent) approximately 1 hour before yescarta infusion is recommended. 
 • prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the activity of yescarta.</p><p>
 monitoring • patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities.</p><p>physicians should consider 
 hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs or symptoms of crs and/or 
 neurologic events. 
 • after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion. 
 • patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion.</p><p>

 4 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product this medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells.</p><p>healthcare professionals handling yescarta should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid 
 potential transmission of infectious diseases.</p><p>
 preparation of yescarta • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>
 • the yescarta bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.</p><p>
 • once the patient id is confirmed, remove the yescarta bag from the cassette. • check that the patient information on the cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing.</p><p>if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines (or immediately contact kite). 
 • place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag or per local guidelines. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag.</p><p>gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps 
 of cellular material.</p><p>if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the 
 bag.</p><p>small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing.</p><p>
 yescarta should not be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to 
 infusion.</p><p>thawing should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 °c-25 °c) for up to 3 hours.</p><p>
 administration • for autologous use only. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment should be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. 
 • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • central venous access is recommended for the administration of yescarta. • verify the patient id again to match the patient identifiers on the yescarta bag. • prime the tubing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) prior to infusion. 
 • infuse the entire content of the yescarta bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>yescarta is stable at room temperature for up to 3 hours after thaw. 
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. • after the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) to ensure all yescarta is 
 delivered.</p><p>

 contraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>general</p><p>
 due to the risks associated with yescarta treatment, infusion should be delayed if a patient has 
 any of the following conditions: 
 • unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or hypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. 
 5 • active uncontrolled infection. • active graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta should not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for 
 transplantation.</p><p>
 yescarta is intended solely for autologous use and must not be administered to other patients.</p><p>
 before infusion, the patient’s identity must match the patient identifiers on the yescarta infusion 
 bag and cassette.</p><p>do not infuse yescarta if the information on the patient-specific label does not 
 match the intended patient.</p><p>
 concomitant disease</p><p>
 patients with active cns disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac function are 
 likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require 
 special attention.</p><p>
 primary central nervous system (cns) lymphoma</p><p>
 there is no experience of use of yescarta in patients with primary cns lymphoma.</p><p>therefore, 
 the risk/benefit of yescarta has not been established in this population.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>
 nearly all patients experienced some degree of crs.</p><p>severe crs, including life-threatening and fatal 
 reactions, was very commonly observed with yescarta with a time to onset of 1 to 12 days (see 
 section 4.8).</p><p>
 ensure that a minimum of 4 doses of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (il-6) receptor inhibitor, are 
 available for each patient prior to infusion of yescarta.</p><p>
 monitor patients daily for signs and symptoms of crs for at least 10 days following infusion at the 
 qualified clinical facility.</p><p>after the first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at 
 the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks 
 following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs occur.</p><p>
 treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the crs symptoms experienced by 
 patients on yescarta.</p><p>these include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids for 
 moderate, severe, or life-threatening crs as summarised in table 1.</p><p>patients who experience grade 2 
 or higher crs (e.g. hypotension, not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental 
 oxygenation) should be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.</p><p>for patients 
 experiencing severe crs, consider performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.</p><p>for 
 severe or life-threatening crs, consider intensive-care supportive therapy.</p><p>
 yescarta should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disease 
 until these conditions have resolved.</p><p>
 crs has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and 
 pulmonary).</p><p>in addition worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of crs.</p><p>
 patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be managed by standards of critical 
 care and measures such as echocardiography should be considered.</p><p>
 diagnosis of crs requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including 
 infection.</p><p>in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum 
 antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 6 evaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (hlh/mas) should be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive crs.</p><p>
 yescarta continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and 
 corticosteroids.</p><p>tumour necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
 yescarta-associated crs.</p></section><section><header>table 1: crs grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>crs grade (a)

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 yescarta, an engineered autologous t-cell immunotherapy product, binds to cd19 expressing 
 cancer cells and normal b cells.</p><p>following anti-cd19 car t-cell engagement with cd19 expressing 
 target cells, the cd28 and cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signalling cascades 
 that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions, and secretion of 
 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of 
 cd19-expressing target cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in phase 2 of zuma-1, after yescarta infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated over 
 a 4-week interval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in 
 blood.</p><p>levels of cytokines and chemokines such as il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, tnf-α, ifn-γ, and 
 il2rα were analyzed.</p><p>peak elevation was observed within the first 14 days after infusion, and levels 
 generally returned to baseline within 28 days.</p><p>
 due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of yescarta, a period of b-cell aplasia is expected 
 following treatment. among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had detectable 
 b-cells; the b-cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior 
 therapies. following yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells 
 decreased: 20% had detectable b-cells at month 3, and 22% had detectable b-cells at month 6. the 
 initiation of b-cell recovery was first noted at month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable b-cells. 
 this trend of b-cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 
 18, and 77% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 24. patients were not required to be followed 
 after they progressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders.</p><p>
 analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of crs or 
 neurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of il-15, as well as il-6, 
 were associated with grade 3 or higher neurologic adverse reactions and grade 3 or higher crs.</p><p>

 dlbcl, pmbcl and dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma (zuma-1) 14 a total of 108 patients were treated with yescarta in a phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive b-cell nhl.</p><p>efficacy was based on 
 101 patients in phase 2, including histologically confirmed dlbcl (n = 77), pmbcl (n = 8), or 
 dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma, (n = 16) based on the 2008 who-classification.</p><p>dlbcl 
 in zuma-1 included patients with dlbcl nos, other dlbcl subtypes, and high-grade b-cell 
 lymphoma (hgbcl) based on the 2016 who-classification.</p><p>forty-seven patients were evaluable for 
 myc, bcl-2, and bcl-6 status.</p><p>thirty were found to have double expressor dlbcl 
 (overexpression of both myc and bcl-2 protein); 5 were found to have hgbcl with myc, bcl-2

 otherwise specified.</p><p>sixty-six patients were evaluable for cell-of-origin classifications (germinal 
 center b-cell type [gcb] or activated b-cell type [abc]).</p><p>of these, 49 patients had gcb-type and

 6. contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what yescarta is and what it is used for</header><p>yescarta is a type of medicine called a “genetically modified cell therapy”.</p><p> 
 yescarta is made specially for you as a single administration of your own modified white blood 
 cells.</p><p>it is given by a drip (
 infusion) into a vein (intravenously).</p><p>
 it is used to treat aggressive conditions in adults with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and 
 primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl) affecting your lymph tissue (part of the immune 
 system) that affects a type of white blood cell called b lymphocytes and other organs in your body.</p><p>
 too many of these abnormal white blood cells accumulate in your tissue and this is the cause of the 
 symptoms you may have.</p><p>it is used to treat these conditions when other available medicines have 
 stopped working for you.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you are given yescarta 
  
 you should not be given yescarta</header><p>if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</p><p>if you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice.</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>yescarta is made from your own white blood cells and should only be given to you.</p></section><section><header>before you are given yescarta you should tell your doctor if you:</header><p>- have problems with your nervous system (such as fits, stroke, or memory loss). 
 -</p><p>have kidney problems. 
 30 - have low blood cell levels (blood counts). 
 -</p><p>have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. 
 -</p><p>have any lung, heart or blood pressure (low or raised) problems. 
 -</p><p>have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease.</p><p>this happens when transplanted cells 
 attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
 stools. 
 -</p><p>notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse.</p><p>if you have lymphoma this might 
 include fever, feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss. 
 -</p><p>have an infection.</p><p>the infection will be treated before the yescarta infusion. 
 -</p><p>have had hepatitis b, hepatitis c or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given 
 yescarta.</p></section><section><header>tests and checks before you are given yescarta your doctor will:</header><p>• check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. • look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given yescarta. • check if your cancer is getting worse. • look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. • check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood.</p><p>this will show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome.</p><p>you may be given 
 medicines to help prevent the condition. 
 • check for hepatitis b, hepatitis c or hiv infection. • check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months.</p></section><section><header>after you have been given yescarta tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following:</header><p>• chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat, which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome.</p><p>take 
 your temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with yescarta.</p><p>if your 
 temperature is high, see your doctor immediately. 
 • fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
 • fever, which may be a symptom of an infection. • extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red blood cells. 
 • bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood known as platelets.</p><p>
 your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
 components may decrease.</p><p>
 do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
 yescarta.</p><p>your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with 
 yescarta.</p><p>
 in some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with yescarta.</p><p>for 
 example:</p><p>
 -</p><p>if yescarta infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received preparatory 
 chemotherapy you may have to receive more preparative chemotherapy.</p><p>31</p></section><section><header>children and adolescents</header><p>yescarta should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and yescarta</header><p>tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p><p>
 before you are given yescarta tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that 
 weaken your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the 
 effect of yescarta.</p><p>
 in particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
 • in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting chemotherapy) to prepare your body for the yescarta cells. 
 • during yescarta treatment. • after treatment while the immune system is recovering.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine.</p><p>this is because the effects of yescarta in 
 pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
 breast-fed child. 
 • if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with yescarta, talk to your doctor immediately. 
 • you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts.</p><p>yescarta should only be given if the results show you are not pregnant.</p><p>
 discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received yescarta.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>some people may feel tired, dizzy or have some shaking after being given yescarta.</p><p>if this happens to you, do not drive or use heavy machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until your 
 doctor tells you that you have completely recovered.</p></section><section><header>yescarta contains sodium</header><p>this medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion.</p><p>this is the equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how yescarta is given</header><p>yescarta will always be given to you by a healthcare professional.</p><p>• since yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you to prepare your medicine.</p><p>your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed 
 in your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis).</p><p>some of your white blood cells are separated 
 from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein.</p><p>this can take 3 to 6 hours 
 and may need to be repeated. 
 • your white blood cells are frozen and sent away to make yescarta.</p><p>it usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to receive your yescarta therapy but the time may vary.</p><p>
 32</p></section><section><header>medicines given before yescarta treatment</header><p>during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given yescarta you may be given other medicines.</p><p>this is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever.</p><p>these other medicines may include: 
 • paracetamol. • an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.</p><p>
 prior to receiving yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, 
 which will allow your modified white blood cells in yescarta to multiply in your body when the 
 medicine is given to you.</p><p>
 your doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours.</p></section><section><header>how you are given yescarta</header><p>• yescarta is a one-time treatment.</p><p>it will not be given to you again. • your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of yescarta into your vein for approximately 30 minutes. 
 • yescarta is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells.</p><p>your healthcare professional handling yescarta will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves 
 and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local 
 biosafety guidelines to clean up or dispose of any material that has been in contact with 
 yescarta.</p><p>
 you must receive yescarta infusion in a qualified clinical facility and be discharged only when 
 your doctor thinks it is safe for you to go home. 
 your doctor may do blood tests to check for side effects.</p></section><section><header>after you are given yescarta</header><p>• plan to stay within proximity from the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after you have been given yescarta.</p><p>your doctor will recommend that you return to the 
 hospital daily for at least 10 days and will consider whether you need to stay at the hospital as 
 an in-patient for the first 10 days after infusion.</p><p>this is so your doctor can check if your 
 treatment is working and help you if you have any side effects.</p><p>
 if you miss any appointments, call your doctor or the qualified clinical facility as soon as possible to 
 reschedule your appointment.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>
