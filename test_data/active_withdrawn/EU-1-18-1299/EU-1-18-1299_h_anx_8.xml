 patient-specific infusion bag and cassette label does not match the patient’s identity.</p><p>
 monitoring after infusion</p><p>
 patients must be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of 
 potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities. physicians should consider hospitalisation for 
 the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of crs and/or neurologic events. after 
 the first 10 days following infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 5 patients are to be counselled to remain within the proximity of a qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs 
 or neurological adverse reactions occur. vital signs and organ function must be monitored depending 
 on the severity of the reaction.</p><p>
 reasons to delay treatment</p><p>
 due to the risks associated with yescarta treatment, infusion must be delayed if a patient has any of 
 the following conditions: 
 • unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or hypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. 
 • active uncontrolled infection. • active graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).</p><p>
 serological testing</p><p>
 screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing of 
 yescarta (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 blood, organ, tissue and cell donation</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation.</p><p>
 concomitant disease</p><p>
 patients with active cns disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac function are 
 likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require 
 special attention.</p><p>
 primary central nervous system (cns) lymphoma</p><p>
 there is no experience of use of yescarta in patients with primary cns lymphoma. therefore, the 
 risk/benefit of yescarta has not been established in this population.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>
 nearly all patients experienced some degree of crs. severe crs, including life-threatening and fatal 
 reactions, was very commonly observed with yescarta with a time to onset of 1 to 12 days in 
 zuma-1 and zuma-7, and 1 to 11 days in zuma-5 (see section 4.8). crs should be managed at the 
 physician’s discretion, based on the patient’s clinical presentation and according to the crs 
 management algorithm provided in table 1. interleukin-6 (il-6) receptor inhibitor based therapy such 
 as tocilizumab has been administered for moderate or severe crs associated with yescarta.</p><p>
 at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient must be on site and available for administration prior to 
 yescarta infusion. the treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 
 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a 
 shortage that is listed in the european medicine agency shortage catalogue, the treatment centre must 
 have access to suitable alternative measures instead of tocilizumab to treat crs.</p><p>
 patients must be monitored daily for signs and symptoms of crs for at least 10 days following 
 infusion at the qualified clinical facility. after the first 10 days following infusion, the patient is to be 
 monitored at the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 patients are to be counselled to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 
 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs 
 occur. treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the crs symptoms 
 experienced by patients on yescarta. these include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and 
 6 corticosteroids for moderate, severe, or life-threatening crs as summarised in table 1. patients who experience grade 2 or higher crs (e.g. hypotension, not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring 
 supplemental oxygenation) must be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. 
 for patients experiencing severe crs, consider performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac 
 function. for severe or life-threatening- crs, consider intensive-care supportive therapy.</p><p>
 yescarta must not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disease until 
 these conditions have resolved.</p><p>
 crs has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and 
 pulmonary). in addition, worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of crs. 
 patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction must be managed by standards of critical care 
 and measures such as echocardiography are to be considered.</p><p>
 diagnosis of crs requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including 
 infection. in the event of febrile neutropenia, infection is to be considered and managed with broad 
 spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 evaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (hlh/mas) 
 is to be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive crs.</p><p>
 yescarta continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. 
 tumour necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
 yescarta-associated crs.</p><p>

 severe neurologic adverse reactions, also known as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
 syndrome (icans), have been very commonly observed in patients treated with yescarta, which 
 could be life-threatening or fatal (see section 4.8). patients with a history of cns disorders such as 
 seizures or cerebrovascular ischaemia may be at increased risk. fatal and serious cases of cerebral 
 oedema have been reported in patients treated with yescarta. patients must be monitored for signs and 
 symptoms of neurologic adverse reactions (table 2). patients must be monitored at least daily for 
 10 days at the qualified clinical facility following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic 
 toxicity/icans. after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the 
 physician’s discretion. patients are to be counselled to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical 
 facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or 
 8 symptoms of neurologic toxicity/icans occur. vital signs and organ functions must be monitored depending on the severity of the reaction.</p><p>
 patients who experience grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities/icans must be monitored with 
 continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. intensive-care supportive therapy must be provided 
 for severe or life-threatening neurologic toxicities. non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines are to be 
 considered for seizure prophylaxis as clinically indicated for grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. 
 treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate the neurologic adverse reactions experienced 
 by patients on yescarta. these include the use of tocilizumab (if concurrent crs) and/or 
 corticosteroids for moderate, severe, or life-threatening neurologic adverse reactions as summarised in 
 table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2: neurologic adverse reaction/icans grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>grading assessment

 serious infections have been very commonly observed with yescarta (see section 4.8). patients must 
 be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before, during, and after yescarta infusion and 
 9 treated appropriately. prophylactic anti-microbials should be administered according to standard institutional guidelines.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after yescarta infusion (see section 4.8) and may be 
 concurrent with crs. in the event of febrile neutropenia, infection is to be considered and managed 
 with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 hbv reactivation</p><p>
 hbv reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur 
 in patients treated with drugs directed against b-cells. screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv must be 
 performed before collection of cells for manufacturing of yescarta.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias</p><p>
 patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
 yescarta infusion. grade 3 or higher prolonged cytopenias following yescarta infusion occurred very 
 commonly and included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. blood counts are to be 
 monitored after treatment with yescarta.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia</p><p>
 b-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with 
 yescarta. hypogammaglobulinaemia has been very commonly observed in patients treated with 
 yescarta. immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with yescarta and managed 
 using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement.</p><p>
 hypersensitivity reactions</p><p>
 allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of yescarta. serious hypersensitivity reactions 
 including anaphylaxis, may be due to dmso or residual gentamicin in yescarta.</p><p>
 secondary malignancies</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta may develop secondary malignancies. patients are to be monitored 
 life-long for secondary malignancies. in the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, the company is 
 to be contacted to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.</p><p>
 tumour lysis syndrome (tls)</p><p>
 tls, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. to minimise risk of tls, patients with 
 elevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, 
 prior to yescarta infusion. signs and symptoms of tls must be monitored and events managed 
 according to standard guidelines.</p><p>
 cd19-negative disease</p><p>
 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients exposed to prior cd19-directed therapy. 
 yescarta is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with cd19-negative disease after prior 
 anti-cd19 therapy.</p><p>
 there are limited data available on cd19-negative patients treated with yescarta and it is possible that 
 cd19-negative patients may have less benefit compared with cd19-positive patients. patients with 
 cd19-negative status by immunohistochemistry may still express cd19 and have been shown to 
 benefit from treatment with yescarta. the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of 
 cd19-negative patients with yescarta should be considered.</p><p>
 10 long-term follow-up</p><p>
 patients are expected to enrol in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better 
 understand the long-term safety and efficacy of yescarta.</p><p>
 excipients (sodium)</p><p>
 this medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion bag, equivalent to 15% of the who

 live vaccines</p><p>
 the safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following yescarta treatment has not 
 been studied. as a precautionary measure, vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended 
 for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during yescarta treatment, 
 and until immune recovery following treatment with yescarta.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception</p><p>
 the pregnancy status of women of child bearing potential must be verified before starting yescarta 
 treatment.</p><p>
 see the prescribing information for lymphodepleting chemotherapy for information on the need for 
 effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p>
 there are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of 
 contraception following treatment with yescarta.</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no available data with yescarta use in pregnant women. no reproductive and developmental 
 toxicity animal studies have been conducted with yescarta to assess whether it can cause foetal harm 
 when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 it is not known if yescarta has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. based on the mechanism of 
 action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including b-cell 
 lymphocytopenia. therefore, yescarta is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for 
 women of childbearing potential not using contraception. pregnant women must be advised on the 
 potential risks to the foetus. pregnancy after yescarta therapy must be discussed with the treating 
 physician.</p><p>
 assessment of immunoglobulin levels and b-cells in newborns of mothers treated with yescarta must 
 be considered.</p><p>breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is unknown whether yescarta is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. 
 breast-feeding women must be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.</p><p>

 no clinical data on the effect of yescarta on fertility are available. effects on male and female fertility 
 have not been evaluated in animal studies.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>yescarta has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients must refrain from driving or

 3 days (range: 1 to 12 days) and the median duration was 7 days (range: 2 to 58 days). ninety-nine 
 percent (99%) of patients recovered from crs. no crs was reported by patients treated with standard 
 of care therapy (soct) in zuma-7.</p><p>
 in zuma-5, crs occurred in 77% of patients. six percent (6%) of patients experienced grade 3 or 
 higher (severe, life-threatening, and fatal) crs. the median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1 to

 patients experienced grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) adverse reactions. neurologic 
 toxicities occurred within the first 7 days of infusion for 65% of patients. the median time to onset 
 was 7 days (range: 1 to 177 days). the median duration was 14 days, with resolution occurring within 
 3 weeks for 60% of patients following infusion.</p><p>
 the most common (≥ 5%) neurologic adverse reactions included encephalopathy (51%), tremor 
 (28%), and delirium (14%). serious neurologic adverse reactions reported in patients included 
 encephalopathy (18%), tremor (2%), delirium (2%), hemiparesis (1%) and seizure (1%). in zuma-7, 
 encephalopathy and tremor were reported in 49% and 25% of patients treated with yescarta compared 
 to 8% and 1% treated with soct, respectively.</p><p>
 other neurologic adverse reactions have been reported less frequently in clinical trials and included 
 dysphagia (3%), myelitis (0.2%), and quadriplegia (0.2%).</p><p>
 see section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia and infections</p><p>febrile neutropenia was observed in 10% of patients after yescarta infusion. infections occurred in 48% of patients. grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) infections occurred in 19% of 
 patients. grade 3 or higher unspecified pathogen, bacterial, and viral infections occurred in 12%, 6%, 
 and 5% of patients respectively. the most common site of unspecified pathogen infection was in the 
 respiratory tract. in zuma-7, febrile neutropenia and viral infection were reported in 2% and 16% of 
 16 patients treated with yescarta compared to 27% and 5% treated with soct, respectively. see section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias</p><p>grade 3 or higher neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), anaemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 68%, 31%, and 23% of patients, respectively. prolonged (still present at day 30 or with an 
 onset at day 30 or beyond) grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia occurred 
 in 26%, 12%, and 6% of patients, respectively. in zuma-1, at the time of the 24-month follow-up 
 analysis, grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia present after day 93 occurred 
 in 11%, 7%, and 3% of patients, respectively. in zuma-7, grade 3 or higher neutropenia and 
 thrombocytopenia were reported in 94% and 26% of patients treated with yescarta compared to 51% 
 and 63% treated with soct, respectively. see section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 15% of patients treated with yescarta. cumulatively, 36 (33%) of 108 patients in zuma-1 received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy by the time of the 
 54-month analysis, 28 (16%) of 170 patients in zuma-7 received intravenous immunoglobulin 
 therapy by the time of the 23.2 month analysis and 33 (28%) of 119 subjects in zuma-5 received 
 intravenous immunoglobulin therapy at the time of the 24-month follow-up analysis. in zuma-7, 
 immunoglobulins decreased was reported in 11% of patients treated with yescarta compared to 1% of 
 patients treated with soct. see section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>
 immunogenicity</p><p>
 the immunogenicity of yescarta has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
 (elisa) for the detection of binding antibodies against fmc63, the originating antibody of the 
 anti-cd19 car. eleven out of 278 patients (4%) tested positive for anti-fmc63 antibodies prior to 
 being treated with yescarta in zuma-1 and zuma-7, and 1 patient (1%) in zuma-7 who had a 
 negative test result prior to treatment, had a positive test result after treatment in the screening elisa. 
 results of a confirmatory cell-based assay, leveraging a properly folded and expressed extracellular 
 portion of the car (scfv, hinge and linker) demonstrated that all patients treated with yescarta that 
 had a positive result in the screening elisa were antibody negative at all time points tested. there is 
 no evidence that the kinetics of initial expansion and persistence of yescarta, or the safety or 
 effectiveness of yescarta, was altered in these patients. in zuma-5, 13 out of 116 patients (11%) 
 tested positive for antibodies in the elisa screening assay prior to being treated with yescarta, and 2 
 subjects who had negative results prior to treatment had positive test results after treatment. results of 
 a confirmatory cell-based assay demonstrated that all patients treated with yescarta that had an elisa 
 positive result were antibody negative, before, during and after treatment.</p><p>
 special population</p><p>
 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients ≥ 75 years of age. generally, safety and efficacy 
 were similar between patients ≥ 65 years and patients &lt; 65 years of age treated with yescarta. 
 outcomes were consistent between patients with eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) of 0 
 and 1 and by sex.</p><p>
 post-marketing experience</p><p>
 adverse reactions reported in the post-marketing setting include status epilepticus (0.3%), spinal cord 
 oedema and icans.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions</p><p>
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in appendix v.

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 yescarta, an engineered autologous t-cell immunotherapy product, binds to cd19 expressing cancer 
 cells and normal b-cells. following anti-cd19 car t-cell engagement with cd19 expressing target 
 cells, the cd28 and cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signalling cascades that 
 lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions, and secretion of inflammatory 
 cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of cd19-
 expressing target cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 after yescarta infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated by measuring transient elevation 
 of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in blood over a 4-week interval. levels of cytokines 
 and chemokines such as il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, tnf-α, ifn-γ, and il2rα were analyzed. peak 
 elevation was observed within the first 14 days after infusion, and levels generally returned to baseline 
 within 28 days.</p><p>
 analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of crs or 
 neurologic events showed that higher post-infusion levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of multiple 
 immune-modulatory and pro-inflammatory analytes were associated with grade 3 or higher 
 neurologic adverse reactions and grade 3 or higher crs in zuma-1, zuma-7 and zuma-5.</p><p>
 due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of yescarta, a period of b-cell aplasia is expected following 
 treatment. among 73 patients in zuma-1 with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had detectable 
 b-cells; the b-cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior 
 therapies. following yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells decreased: 
 20% had detectable b-cells at month 3, and 22% had detectable b-cells at month 6. the initiation of 
 b-cell recovery was first noted at month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable b-cells. this trend of 
 b-cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 18, and 77% 
 of patients had detectable b-cells at month 24. among 141 patients in zuma-7 with evaluable 
 samples at baseline, 57% had detectable b-cells. following yescarta treatment, the proportion of 
 patients with detectable b-cells decreased: 38% had detectable b-cells at month 3, and 41% had 
 detectable b-cells at month 6. the initiation of b-cell recovery was apparent at month 9, when 58% 
 had detectable b-cells. this trend of b-cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had 
 detectable b-cells at month 18 and 84% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 24. among 113 
 fl patients with evaluable samples at baseline in zuma-5, 75% of patients had detectable b-cells. 
 following yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells decreased: 40% of 
 patients had detectable b-cells at month 3. b-cell recovery was observed over time, with 61% of 
 patients having detectable b-cells at month 24. patients were not required to be followed after they 
 progressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders.</p><p>
 18 clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 relapsed or refractory dlbcl, pmbcl and dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy (zuma-1) 
 a total of 108 patients were treated with yescarta in a phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm study in patients with r/r aggressive b-cell nhl. efficacy was based on 101 patients in phase 2, 
 including histologically confirmed dlbcl (n = 77), pmbcl (n = 8), or dlbcl arising from 
 follicular lymphoma, (n = 16) based on the 2008 who-classification. dlbcl in zuma-1 included 
 patients with dlbcl nos, other dlbcl subtypes, and hgbl based on the 2016 
 who-classification. forty-seven patients were evaluable for myc, bcl-2, and bcl-6 status. thirty 
 were found to have double expressor dlbcl (overexpression of both myc and bcl-2 protein); 5 
 were found to have hgbl with 
 myc, bcl-2 or bcl-6 gene rearrangement (double- and triple-hit); and 2 were found to have hgbl not otherwise specified. sixty-six patients were evaluable for 
 cell-of-origin classifications (germinal center b-cell type [gcb] or activated b-cell type [abc]). of 
 these, 49 patients had gcb-type and 17 patients had abc-type.</p><p>
 eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with refractory disease defined as progressive disease (pd) or 
 stable disease (sd) as best response to last line of therapy, or disease progression within 12 months 
 after autologous stem cell transplant (asct). patients who were refractory to chemotherapy or who 
 relapsed after two or more lines of systemic therapy were generally ineligible for haematopoietic stem 
 cell transplantation. patients must have received at least prior anti-cd20 antibody therapy and an 
 anthracycline containing regimen. patients with cns lymphoma, a history of allogeneic stem cell 
 transplantation (sct) or prior anti-cd19 car or other genetically modified t-cell therapy were 
 excluded. patients with a history of cns disorders (such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischemia), 
 cardiac ejection fraction of less than 50% or room air oxygen saturation of less than 92%, or 
 autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression were ineligible. the median duration of 
 follow-up was 63.1 months (still ongoing). a summary of the patient demographics is provided in

 2 intravenous cyclophosphamide and 30 mg/m
 2 intravenous fludarabine on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before yescarta. bridging chemotherapy 19 between leukapheresis and lymphodepleting chemotherapy was not permitted. all patients were hospitalized for observation for a minimum of 7 days after yescarta infusion.</p><p>
 of 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 101 received yescarta. nine patients were not treated, 
 primarily due to progressive disease or serious adverse events after enrolment and prior to cell 
 delivery. one out of 111 patients did not receive the product due to manufacturing failure. the median 
 time from leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days (range: 14 to 51 days), and the median time 
 from leukapheresis to infusion was 24 days (range: 16 to 73 days). the median dose was 2.0 × 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. itt was defined as all patients who underwent leukapheresis; mitt was defined as all patients who received yescarta.</p><p>
 the primary endpoint was objective response rate (orr). secondary endpoints included duration of 
 response (dor), overall survival (os), and severity of adverse events. the orr was prespecified to 
 be tested in the first 92 treated patients and was significantly higher than the prespecified rate of 20% 
 (p 
 &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in the primary analysis, based on the mitt population (minimum follow-up of 6 months) the orr 
 was 72% and the complete response (cr) rate was 51%, as determined by an independent review 
 committee. in the 12 month follow-up analysis (table 5), the orr was 72% and the cr rate was 
 51%. the median time to response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 6.3 months). the dor was longer in 
 patients who achieved cr, as compared to patients with a best response of partial response (pr). of 
 the 52 patients who achieved cr, 7 patients had sd and 9 had pr at their initial tumour assessment 
 and converted to cr as late as 6.5 months. the orr results within pmbcl and dlbcl arising from 
 follicular lymphoma were both 88%. cr rates were 75% and 56%, respectively. of the 111 patients in 
 the itt population, the orr was 66% and the cr was 47%. other outcomes were consistent with 
 those of the mitt population.</p><p>
 in the 24-month follow-up analysis, based on the mitt population (results from an independent 
 review committee), the orr and the cr rate were 74% and 54%, respectively. the median time to 
 response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 12.2 months). the dor was longer in patients who achieved 
 cr compared to patients with a best response of pr (table 5). of the 55 patients who achieved cr, 7 
 patients had sd and 10 had pr at their initial tumour assessment and converted to cr as late as 
 12 months after yescarta infusion. median duration of response and median os had not been reached 
 (table 5). in a 36-month analysis (median study follow-up of 39.1 months) the median os was 
 25.8 months with 47 patients (47%*) still alive. in a 48-month analysis (median study follow-up of 
 51.1 months) the median os was 25.8 months with 43 patients (44%*) still alive. in a 60-month 
 analysis (median study follow-up of 63.1 months) the median overall survival was 25.8 months with 
 42 patients (43%*) still alive. 
 *the kaplan-meier estimates of the 3-year, 4-year and 5-year os rates were 47%, 44% and 43% 
 respectively.</p><p>
 in the phase 1 part of zuma-1, 7 patients were treated. five patients responded, including 4 crs. at 
 the 12-month follow-up analysis, 3 patients remained in cr 24 months after yescarta infusion. at the 
 24-month follow-up analysis, these 3 patients remained in cr at 30 to 35 months after yescarta 
 infusion.</p></section><section><header>table 5. summary of efficacy results for zuma-1 phase 2</header></section><section><header>category all leukapheresed

 note: the 12-month analysis had a median</p><p>follow-up of 15.1 months. the 24-month analysis had a median follow-up of 27.1 months. overall survival relates to the time from the leukapheresis date (itt) or yescarta infusion (mitt) to death from 
 any cause.</p><p>scholar-1 a retrospective, patient-level, pooled analysis of outcomes in refractory aggressive nhl (n = 636) was conducted (crump et al., 2017) to provide confirmation of the prespecified control response rate 
 of 20% and historical context for interpreting the zuma-1 results. the analysis included patients who 
 had not responded (sd or pd) to their last line of therapy or had relapsed within 12 months after 
 asct. response and survival after treatment with available standard-of-care therapy was evaluated. 
 the orr was 26% [95% ci (21, 31)] and the cr rate was 7% [95% ci (3, 15)], with a median os of

 dlbcl and hgbl that relapses within 12 months from completion of, or is refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy (zuma-7) 
 the efficacy and safety of yescarta in adult patients with r/r large b-cell lymphoma (lbcl) was demonstrated in a phase 3 randomised, open-label, multicenter study (zuma-7). enrolled patients 
 were predominantly diagnosed with dlbcl and hgbl disease subtypes based on the 2016 
 who-classification and all patients had received first-line rituximab and anthracycline-based 
 chemotherapy. in total, 359 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single infusion of 
 yescarta or to receive soct (defined as 2 to 3 cycles of standard chemoimmunotherapy [r-ice, r-
 dhap or r-dhax, r-eshap, or r-gdp] followed by high-dose therapy [hdt] and asct in those 
 with disease response). randomisation was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary 
 refractory, vs relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy vs relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line 
 therapy) and second-line age-adjusted international prognostic index (ipi) (0 to 1 vs 2 to 3) as 
 assessed at the time of screening. the study excluded prior hsct, detectable cerebrospinal fluid 
 malignant cells or brain metastases, eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status 
 of 2 or greater, and any history of central nervous system lymphoma. patients with active or serious 
 infections were excluded, however patients with simple urinary tract infection and uncomplicated 
 bacterial pharyngitis were permitted if responding to active treatment.</p><p>
 following lymphodepleting chemotherapy, yescarta was administered as a single intravenous infusion 
 at a target dose of 2 × 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg (maximum dose: 2 × 108 cells). the lymphodepleting regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m
 2 intravenously and fludarabine 30 mg/m
 2 intravenously, both given on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before yescarta. nondisease modifying bridging therapy limited to corticosteroids, could be administered between leukapheresis and 
 lymphodepleting chemotherapy for patients with high disease burden at screening.</p><p>
 21 in the overall study population, the median age was 59 years (range: 21 to 81 years); 66% were male, and 83% were white. seventy-four percent of patients had primary refractory lbcl and 26% of 
 patients had relapsed within 12 months of first-line therapy. patients had a second-line age-adjusted 
 ipi score of 0-1 (55%) or 2-3 (45%) and an ecog performance status of 0 (54%) or 1 (46%). the 
 median study duration was 24.9 months.</p><p>
 patients in the yescarta and soct arms were categorized as dlbcl nos/without further 
 classification possible (126 patients and 120 patients, respectively); dlbcl arising from follicular 
 lymphoma (19 patients and 27 patients, respectively); hgbl with 
 myc, bcl2, and/or bcl6 (double- and triple-hit) rearrangements (31 patients and 25 patients, respectively) or hgbl nos, (1 patient in 
 the soct arm); the remaining subjects were categorized under not confirmed, missing, or other.</p><p>
 of the 180 patients randomised to receive yescarta, 178 underwent leukapheresis and 170 were 
 treated with yescarta. of the patients treated, 60 (33%) received bridging corticosteroid therapy. there 
 were no manufacturing failures. eight patients (4%) were not treated following leukapheresis, 
 primarily due to progressive disease, serious adverse events, or death. the median time from 
 leukapheresis to product release was 13 days (range: 10 to 24 days), and leukapheresis to yescarta 
 infusion was 26 days (range: 16 to 52 days). the median dose was 2.0 × 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. all 170 patients who received yescarta were monitored at a healthcare facility for a 
 minimum of 7 days. of the 179 patients randomised to receive soct, 36% received hdt-asct and 
 56% of patients received cellular immuno-therapy after no response to or relapse after randomisation 
 to soct.</p><p>
 the primary endpoint was event-free survival (efs) as determined by blinded central review. the 
 summary of efficacy results in the overall population is shown in table 6 and the kaplan-meier curve 
 for efs is shown in figure 1. the 24-month efs was 40.5% [95% ci: 33.2, 47.7] in the yescarta arm 
 and 16.3% [95% ci: 11.1, 22.2] in the soct arm. the median progression free survival (pfs) in the 
 yescarta arm was 14.7 months (95% ci: 5.4, ne) compared with 3.7 months (95% ci: 2.9, 5.3) in the 
 soct arm (hr: 0.490 [95% ci: 0.368, 0.652]). consistent efficacy was observed across selected 
 subgroups including response to first-line therapy, second-line age-adjusted ipi score, ecog 
 performance status, age, double expressor lymphoma status and hgbl disease subtype. at a 
 pre-specified interim analysis at the time of the primary analysis of efs, the overall survival data were 
 not mature. among patients with hgbl per central laboratory, yescarta demonstrated an 
 improvement in efs compared to soct (hr: 0.285 [95% ci: 0.137, 0.594]). the orr was 81% 
 (95% ci: 62.5%, 92.5%) and cr rate was 68% (95% ci: 48.6%, 83.3%) in patients treated with 
 yescarta compared with 42% (95% ci: 23.4%, 63.1%) and 23% (95% ci: 9.0%, 43.6%) respectively

 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product</p><p>
 yescarta must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.</p><p>
 this medicinal product contains human blood cells. healthcare professionals handling yescarta must 
 take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of 
 infectious diseases.</p><p> 
 preparation prior to administration</p><p>
 • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>• the yescarta bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.</p><p>
 • once the patient id is confirmed, remove the yescarta bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines for the handling of waste of human-derived material 
 (or immediately contact kite).</p><p>
 thawing</p><p>
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. yescarta must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new medium prior to infusion. thawing takes 
 approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 °c-25 °c) for up to 3 hours. however, yescarta infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 28 administration</p><p>
 • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage 
 that is listed in the european medicines agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative 
 measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion. 
 • central venous access is recommended for the administration of yescarta. • for autologous use only. • verify the patient id again to match the patient identifiers on the yescarta bag. • prime the tubing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) prior to infusion. 
 • infuse the entire content of the yescarta bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump. 
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. • after the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) to ensure all yescarta is delivered.</p><p>
 accidental exposure</p><p>
 in case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived materials must be 
 followed. work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with yescarta must be 
 decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.</p><p>
 precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product</p><p>
 unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with yescarta (solid and liquid

 (fl) affecting your lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell 
 called b lymphocytes and other organs in your body. too many of these abnormal white blood cells 
 accumulate in your tissue and this is the cause of the symptoms you may have.</p><p>
 the medicine is made specially for you as a single administration of your own modified white blood 
 cells.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you are given yescarta 
  
 you must not be given yescarta:</header><p>- if you are allergic to axicabtagene ciloleucel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
 (listed in section 6). 
 -</p><p>if you cannot receive treatment, called lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which reduces the 
 number of white blood cells in your blood (see also section 3, how yescarta is given).</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>yescarta is made from your own white blood cells and must only be given to you (autologous use).</p></section><section><header>before you are given yescarta you must tell your doctor if you:</header><p>- have problems with your nervous system (such as fits, stroke, or memory loss). 
 -</p><p>have kidney problems. 
 40 - have low blood cell levels (blood counts). 
 -</p><p>have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. 
 -</p><p>have any lung, heart or blood pressure (low or raised) problems. 
 -</p><p>have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. this happens when transplanted cells 
 attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
 stools. 
 -</p><p>notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse. if you have lymphoma this might include 
 fever, feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss. 
 -</p><p>have an infection. the infection will be treated before the yescarta infusion. 
 -</p><p>have had hepatitis b, hepatitis c or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given 
 yescarta.</p></section><section><header>tests and checks before you are given yescarta your doctor will:</header><p>• check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. • look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given yescarta. • check if your cancer is getting worse. • look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. • check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. this will show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. you may be given 
 medicines to help prevent the condition. 
 • check for hepatitis b, hepatitis c or hiv infection. • check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months.</p></section><section><header>after you have been given yescarta tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following:</header><p>• chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat, which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome. take 
 your temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with yescarta. if your temperature is 
 high, see your doctor immediately. 
 • fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
 • fever, which may be a symptom of an infection. • extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red blood cells. 
 • bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood known as platelets.</p><p>
 your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
 components may decrease.</p><p>
 do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
 yescarta. your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with yescarta.</p><p>
 in some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with yescarta. for 
 example:</p><p>
 -</p><p>if yescarta infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received preparatory 
 chemotherapy you may have to receive more preparative chemotherapy.</p><p>41</p></section><section><header>children and adolescents</header><p>yescarta must not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age because yescarta has not been studied in this age group.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and yescarta</header><p>tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p><p>
 before you are given yescarta tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
 your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
 yescarta.</p><p>
 in particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
 • in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting chemotherapy) to prepare your body for the yescarta cells. 
 • during yescarta treatment. • after treatment while the immune system is recovering.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. this is because the effects of yescarta in 
 pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
 breast-fed child. 
 • if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with yescarta, talk to your doctor immediately. 
 • you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. yescarta can only be given if the results show you are not pregnant.</p><p>
 discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received yescarta.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>some people may feel tired, dizzy or have some shaking after being given yescarta. if this happens to you, do not drive or use heavy machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until your doctor tells 
 you that you have completely recovered.</p></section><section><header>yescarta contains sodium, dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso), and residual gentamicin</header><p>this medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion bag. this is the equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
 adult.</p><p>
 this medicine contains dmso and residual gentamicin which may cause severe allergic reactions.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how yescarta is given</header><p>yescarta will always be given to you by a healthcare professional. it is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein (intravenously).</p><p>• since yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you to prepare your medicine. your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in 
 your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). some of your white blood cells are separated from 
 your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. this can take 3 to 6 hours and 
 may need to be repeated. 
 42 • your white blood cells are sent away to make yescarta. it usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to receive your yescarta therapy but the time may vary.</p></section><section><header>medicines given before yescarta treatment</header><p>during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given yescarta you may be given other medicines. this is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. these other medicines may include: 
 • paracetamol. • an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.</p><p>
 prior to receiving yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, 
 which will allow your modified white blood cells in yescarta to multiply in your body when the 
 medicine is given to you.</p><p>
 your doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours.</p></section><section><header>how you are given yescarta</header><p>yescarta will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre.</p><p>
 • yescarta is given in a single dose. • your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of yescarta through a catheter placed into your vein (intravenous</p><p>infusion) over about 30 minutes.</p><p>
 you must receive yescarta infusion in a qualified clinical facility and be discharged only when your 
 doctor thinks it is safe for you to go home. 
 your doctor may do blood tests to check for side effects.</p></section><section><header>after you are given yescarta</header><p>• plan to stay within proximity from the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after you have been given yescarta. your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily 
 for at least 10 days and will consider whether you need to stay at the hospital as an in-patient for 
 the first 10 days after infusion. this is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and 
 help you if you have any side effects.</p><p>
 if you miss any appointments, call your doctor or the qualified clinical facility as soon as possible to 
 reschedule your appointment.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>
 yescarta can cause side effects to your immune system that may be serious or life-threatening, and can 
 lead to death.</p><p>

 47</p></section><section><header>the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</header><p>it is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering yescarta.</p><p> 
 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product</p><p>
 yescarta must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.</p><p>
 this medicinal product contains human blood cells. healthcare professionals handling yescarta must 
 take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of 
 infectious diseases.</p><p>
 work surfaces and materials that have potentially been in contact with yescarta must be 
 decontaminated according to local guidelines on the handling of waste of human-derived materials.</p><p>
 preparation prior to administration 
 • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>• the yescarta product bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. 
 • once the patient’s id is confirmed, remove the yescarta product bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is 
 compromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material (or 
 immediately contact kite).</p><p>
 thawing 
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. yescarta must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new medium prior to infusion. thawing takes 
 approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 ˚c – 25 ˚c) for up to 3 hours. however, yescarta infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 do not use a leukodepleting filter.</p><p>
 administration 
 • the medicine must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with experience in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and 
 management of patients treated with yescarta.</p><p>
 • ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. hospitals should have access to an additional 
 dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional case where 
 tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the european medicines agency 
 shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable alternative measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab 
 are available on-site. 
 • the patient’s identity must be matched with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag.</p><p>• yescarta is for autologous use only.</p><p>• yescarta must be administered as an intravenous infusion using latex-free intravenous tubing without a leukocyte depleting filter within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. all contents of the infusion bag must be infused.</p><p>
 • sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) solution for injection must be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. when the full 
 48 volume of yescarta has been infused, the infusion bag must be rinsed with 10 to 30 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure as many cells as 
 possible are infused into the patient.</p><p>
 accidental exposure</p><p>
 in case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived material must be 
 followed. work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with yescarta must be 
 decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.</p><p>
 precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product 
 unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with yescarta (solid and liquid 
 waste) must be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local 
 guidelines on the handling of waste of human-derived material.</p></section></body></xml>
