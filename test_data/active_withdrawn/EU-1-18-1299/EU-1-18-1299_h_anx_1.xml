 posology</p><p>
 yescarta is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a single dose of yescarta contains 2 x 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (or maximum of 2 x 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 ml dispersion in an infusion bag.</p><p>
 the availability of yescarta must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen.</p><p>
 pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) • a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenous and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenous should be administered on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before infusion of yescarta.</p><p>
 pre-medication • paracetamol 500-1,000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 25 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent) approximately 1 hour before yescarta infusion is recommended. 
 • prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the activity of yescarta.</p><p>
 monitoring • patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities.</p><p>physicians should consider 
 hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs or symptoms of crs and/or 
 neurologic events. 
 • after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion. 
 • patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion.</p><p>

 4 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product this medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells.</p><p>healthcare professionals handling yescarta should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid 
 potential transmission of infectious diseases.</p><p>
 preparation of yescarta • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>
 • the yescarta bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.</p><p>
 • once the patient id is confirmed, remove the yescarta bag from the cassette. • check that the patient information on the cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing.</p><p>if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines (or immediately contact kite). 
 • place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag per local guidelines. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag.</p><p>gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps 
 of cellular material.</p><p>if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the 
 bag.</p><p>small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing.</p><p>
 yescarta should not be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to 
 infusion.</p><p>thawing should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 °c-25 °c) for up to 3 hours.</p><p>
 administration • for autologous use only. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment should be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. 
 • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • central venous access is recommended for the administration of yescarta. • verify the patient id again to match the patient identifiers on the yescarta bag. • prime the tubing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) prior to infusion. 
 • infuse the entire content of the yescarta bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>yescarta is stable at room temperature for up to 3 hours after thaw. 
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. • after the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) to ensure all yescarta is 
 delivered.</p><p>

 contraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>general</p><p>
 due to the risks associated with yescarta treatment, infusion should be delayed if a patient has 
 any of the following conditions: 
 • unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or hypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. 
 5 • active uncontrolled infection. • active graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta should not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for 
 transplantation.</p><p>
 yescarta is intended solely for autologous use and must not be administered to other patients.</p><p>
 before infusion, the patient’s identity must match the patient identifiers on the yescarta infusion 
 bag and cassette.</p><p>do not infuse yescarta if the information on the patient-specific label does not 
 match the intended patient.</p><p>
 concomitant disease</p><p>
 patients with active cns disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac function are 
 likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require 
 special attention.</p><p>
 primary central nervous system (cns) lymphoma</p><p>
 there is no experience of use of yescarta in patients with primary cns lymphoma.</p><p>therefore, 
 the risk/benefit of yescarta has not been established in this population.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>
 nearly all patients experienced some degree of crs.</p><p>severe crs, including life-threatening and fatal 
 reactions, was very commonly observed with yescarta with a time to onset of 1 to 12 days (see 
 section 4.8).</p><p>
 ensure that a minimum of 4 doses of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (il-6) receptor inhibitor, are 
 available for each patient prior to infusion of yescarta.</p><p>
 monitor patients daily for signs and symptoms of crs for at least 10 days following infusion at the 
 qualified clinical facility.</p><p>after the first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at 
 the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks 
 following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs occur.</p><p>
 treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the crs symptoms experienced by 
 patients on yescarta.</p><p>these include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids for 
 moderate, severe, or life-threatening crs as summarised in table 1.</p><p>patients who experience grade 2 
 or higher crs (e.g. hypotension, not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental 
 oxygenation) should be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.</p><p>for patients 
 experiencing severe crs, consider performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.</p><p>for 
 severe or life-threatening crs, consider intensive-care supportive therapy.</p><p>
 yescarta should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disease 
 until these conditions have resolved.</p><p>
 crs has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and 
 pulmonary).</p><p>in addition worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of crs.</p><p>
 patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be managed by standards of critical 
 care and measures such as echocardiography should be considered.</p><p>
 diagnosis of crs requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including 
 infection.</p><p>in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum 
 antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 6 evaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (hlh/mas) should be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive crs.</p><p>
 yescarta continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and 
 corticosteroids.</p><p>tumour necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
 yescarta-associated crs.</p></section><section><header>table 1: crs grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>crs grade (a)

 section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>immunogenicity</p><p>
 the immunogenicity of yescarta has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
 assay (elisa) for the detection of binding antibodies against fmc63, the originating antibody of the 
 anti-cd19 car.</p><p>three patients tested positive for anti-fmc63 prior to being treated with 
 yescarta.</p><p>an impact of these antibodies on efficacy or safety was not discernible.</p><p>
 special population</p><p>
 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients ≥ 75 years of age.</p><p>generally, safety and 
 efficacy were similar between patients ≥ 65 years and patients &lt; 65 years of age treated with 
 yescarta.</p><p>outcomes were consistent between patients with eastern cooperative oncology group 
 (ecog) of 0 and 1 and by sex.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions</p><p>
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.</p><p>it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.</p><p>healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in appendix v.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there are no data regarding the signs of overdose with yescarta.</p><p>13</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, atc code: not yet assigned</p><p>
 mechanism of action</p><p>
 yescarta, an engineered autologous t-cell immunotherapy product, binds to cd19 expressing 
 cancer cells and normal b cells.</p><p>following anti-cd19 car t-cell engagement with cd19 expressing 
 target cells, the cd28 and cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signalling cascades 
 that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions, and secretion of 
 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of 
 cd19-expressing target cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in phase 2 of zuma-1, after yescarta infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated over 
 a 4-week interval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in 
 blood.</p><p>levels of cytokines and chemokines such as il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, tnf-α, ifn-γ, and 
 il2rα were analyzed.</p><p>peak elevation was observed within the first 14 days after infusion, and levels 
 generally returned to baseline within 28 days.</p><p>
 due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of yescarta, a period of b-cell aplasia is expected 
 following treatment. among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had detectable 
 b-cells; the b-cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior 
 therapies. following yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells 
 decreased: 20% had detectable b-cells at month 3, and 22% had detectable b-cells at month 6. the 
 initiation of b-cell recovery was first noted at month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable b-cells. 
 this trend of b-cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 
 18, and 77% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 24. patients were not required to be followed 
 after they progressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders.</p><p>
 analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of crs or 
 neurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of il-15, as well as il-6, 
 were associated with grade 3 or higher neurologic adverse reactions and grade 3 or higher crs.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 dlbcl, pmbcl and dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma (zuma-1) a total of 108 patients were treated with yescarta in a phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive b-cell nhl.</p><p>efficacy was based on 
 101 patients in phase 2, including histologically confirmed dlbcl (n = 77), pmbcl (n = 8), or 
 dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma, (n = 16) based on the 2008 who-classification.</p><p>dlbcl 
 in zuma-1 included patients with dlbcl nos, other dlbcl subtypes, and high-grade b-cell 
 lymphoma (hgbcl) based on the 2016 who-classification.</p><p>forty-seven patients were evaluable for 
 myc, bcl-2, and bcl-6 status.</p><p>thirty were found to have double expressor dlbcl 
 (overexpression of both myc and bcl-2 protein); 5 were found to have hgbcl with myc, bcl-2 
 or bcl-6 gene rearrangement (double- and triple-hit); and 2 were found to have hgbcl not 
 otherwise specified.</p><p>sixty-six patients were evaluable for cell-of-origin classifications (germinal 
 center b-cell type [gcb] or activated b-cell type [abc]).</p><p>of these, 49 patients had gcb-type and 
 17 patients had abc-type.</p><p>
