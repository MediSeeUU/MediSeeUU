 introduction</header><p>the therapeutic goal of treatment for chronic hepatitis c (chc) is the eradication of the hepatitis c virus (hcv) with a halting/reversal of the disease progression, which is essentially a cure of this 
 disease.</p><p>until recently, the standard of care treatment was the combination of peginterferon alpha 
 (peg) and ribavirin (rbv). of the six major hcv genotypes, genotype 1 is the least responsive to peg 
 plus rbv with sustained virological response (svr) rates of approximately 40% in previously untreated 
 hcv genotype 1 patients. svr rates are even lower in blacks and in subjects with advanced liver 
 fibrosis/cirrhosis. merck (schering-plough research institute) hcv clinical studies showed that in 
 patients not achieving svr (nonresponders and relapsers) with peg plus rbv, approximately 25% to 
 30% of the nonresponders had substantial liver fibrosis with likelihood for further disease progression, 
 thus identifying an unmet medical need to increase response rates for both previously untreated and 
 previous treatment-failure (relapsers/nonresponders) hcv genotype 1 patients. 
 in response to this unmet medical need, victrelis (international nonproprietary name [inn] 
 boceprevir, sch 503034, referred to as boc hereafter) was developed. boc is a potent, orally 
 administered, serine protease inhibitor, specifically designed to inhibit the hcv nonstructural protein 3 
 (ns3) protease and, thereby, inhibit viral replication in infected host cells.</p><p>boc (victrelis, 
 eu/1/11/704/001), when added to standard-of-care peg plus rbv, has been assessed by the 
 ema/chmp (positive opinion adopted on 26 may 2011) and approved by the european commission 
 (marketing authorisation granted 18 july 2011) for the treatment of chc genotype 1 infection in adult 
 patients with compensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous 
 therapy. 
 the marketing authorisation holder (mah) is submitting data from two pivotal phase 3 studies:</p><p>one in 
 naive patients (p05216) and one in previously treated patients (p05101), to support the update of 
 annexes i and iiib of the pegintron/viraferonpeg (peginterferon alfa-2b) and rebetol (ribavirin) 200 
 mg hard capsules product information concerning the use of tritherapy (pegintron/viraferonpeg + 
 rebetol + victrelis) to treat chc genotype 1 infected adult patients with compensated liver disease 
 who are previously untreated or have failed previous therapy.</p><p>in addition the mah is submitting data 
 that were also included with the victrelis maa from a number of supportive phase 2/3 trials. 
 all data submitted within this dossier has previously been submitted to and assessed by the agency as 
 part of the victrelis marketing authorisation application (maa) emea/h/c/2332.</p><p>
 the aim of this variation is as such to introduce the tritherapy indication to the product information of</p><p>
 pegintron/viraferonpeg and rebetol.</p><p>
 the following sections of the smpc for pegintron/viraferonpeg and rebetol are amended to cross refer 
 to the boceprevir smpc, as it is expected that physicians will use the boceprevir smpc for the use of 
 tritherapy:

 page 7/78</p><p> study conduct</p><p>there were two protocol amendments: the first amendment added an open label group, arm 7 (15 of 65 were to be african-american), all of 
 whom were to receive peg 1.5 μg/kg sc for 1 week followed by peg/boc 800 mg tid for 24 weeks.</p><p>
 the second amendment</p><p>
 switch all continuing subjects to boc 800 plus rbv (with peg) as follows: 
  arms 2 to 6: for subjects in the boc 100, 200, and 400-mg arms with significant hcv-rna decrease (hcv-rna ≤10,000 iu/ml) at most recent visit, increase boc dose to 800 mg tid 
 and add weight based rbv. discontinue all other (non-responding) subjects 
  arm 7: add rbv to all the subjects in the boc 800-mg dose (mean treatment duration only 6.5  weeks)  arm 1 (peg/rbv control): at “rollover” week 17 (hcv positive at week 13), add 800 mg boc  an additional 24 weeks of treatment was indicated for all eligible subjects who continued on triple therapy (peg + rbv + boc 800 mg tid)

 ema/chmp/393216/2012</p><p>
 page 8/78</p><p>
  all subjects were followed for 24 weeks after the end of treatment (eot).</p><p>
 this amendment followed a review by the data review advisory board (drab) which identified a low 
 anti-hcv activity of suboptimal boceprevir doses and the important development of resistance in the 
 groups without ribavirin. thus, the decision was taken to switch all continuing subjects to tritherapy 
 with boceprevir 800mg tid.</p><p>
 a total of 357 subjects were randomized in the study: 292 were randomized in the initial six arms of 
 the study, and an additional 65 in arm 7 (peg + boc 800 mg tid). after the implementation of 
 amendment no. 2 and the evaluation of eligible subjects, 143 subjects rolled over into treatment with 
 peg/rbv/boc 800 mg tid for an additional 24 weeks. 
 the majority of subjects in the intent-to-treat (itt) population were male (62%), between 18 and 65 
 years of age (mean = 49.5 years), and white (92%), with the exception of the subset of subjects 
 treated with peg/boc 800 mg (arm 7) in which 23% were african american. 
 sixty-two percent of subjects were classified as genotype 1a, 35% were genotype 1b, and 3% were 
 considered as “other” (genotype 1 unspecified). most of the subjects (82-98%) had baseline hcv-rna 
 levels of &gt;600,000 iu/ml with a mean of 2.9 x 10
 6 iu/ml. this phase ii dose ranging study had a complex 7-arms design to meet the multiple objectives of: 
  determining the most effective dose and treatment duration of boc (100 mg tid, 200 mg tid, 400 mg tod or 800 mg tod) in non responders patients,</p><p>
  determining whether ribavirin is mandatory to enhance the efficacy of pegifn and boc, and  evaluating the safety of boc.</p><p>
 the multiple amendments of this study make its results hardly interpretable. nevertheless lessons 
 were learned which informed the design of the subsequent phase ii study in treatment naïve patients:</p><p>-</p><p>ribavirin is needed to prevent viral breakthrough with resistant variants 
 -</p><p>the antiviral activity of boceprevir is dose-related 800 mg tid of boceprevir in combination with 
 pegintron resulted in the most rapid time to the first hcv-rna negative samples. furthermore, pk 
 analysis suggested that increasing the dose further would not substantially increase trough 
 concentrations.</p><p>
  sprint-1 was an open-label, randomized safety and efficacy trial in adult, treatment-naïve chc subjects with genotype 1 infection. the study compared standard-of-care peg2b (1.5 
 μg/kg) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg/day) for 48 weeks to five treatment strategies 
 containing boceprevir with only one dose tested (800 mg tid)</p><p>

 of subjects were males and 81% (481/595) were white, with a mean age of 47.5 ± 7.7 years and a 
 mean weight of 81.8 ± 17.2 kg. approximately 56% (334/595) had subtype 1a virus; 89% (531/595)

 weeks and a lead-in period resulted in the numerically highest svr rate. results from the low dose 
 ribavirin arm did not support this strategy, which was therefore not used in the phase iii studies 
 a secondary analysis was conducted according to which the pooled 48-week boceprevir arms with and 
 without lead-in had significantly higher svr rates compared to the pooled 28-week boceprevir arms 
 with and without lead-in (p=0.0009). furthermore, of interest, the difference in svr in the pooled 28- 
 and 48-week, lead-in arms vs the pooled 28- and 48-week, no lead-in arms was not statistically 
 significant (p=0.2864); however, there was an overall numerical advantage of 5% for the lead-in 
 arms. (see table below)</p></section><section><header>table 3.</header><p>pooled treatment comparisons and p-values for svr</p></section><section><header>predictability of svr based on early response</header><p>svr rates by time to first negative hcv-rna is shown in the following table.</p><p>

 were clearly higher in patients receiving 48 weeks of total therapy, compared to 28 weeks. this 
 informed the decision to use a response guided therapy algorithm in phase iii. furthermore, the fact 
 that almost no patient that were treated with boceprevir and became negative after week 12 informed 
 on the potential utility of a futility rule.</p></section><section><header>rationale for 4-week lead-in with p/r on svr</header><p>the theoretical rationale for the 4-week lead-in strategy is based on several factors. the 4-week lead-in allows peg2b and ribavirin to reach steady-state concentrations and, potentially, for the host-
 dependent immune system to be primed by peg2b. also, the lower viral load at the time of initiation of 
 boceprevir therapy might decrease the risk of selection of drug resistant variants and consequent viral 
 breakthrough. 
 as stated above, svr rates were numerically higher in arms using the lead in, combining across 
 treatment groups, the rate of viral breakthrough in the boceprevir lead-in groups was 4% (9/206) 
 compared with 9% (19/210) in the boceprevir groups with no lead in (p=0
 ・057). also, relapse rates were numerically lower in the arms using a lead in. these finding informed its use in the phase iii 
 program.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.2">2.3.2.

 the study compared standard-of-care pr (peg2b 1.5 μg/kg qw plus rbv 600 to 1400 mg/day

 total duration of 28 or 48 weeks, including a 4-week lead-in with pr. a response-guided therapy 
 (rgt) paradigm was used in arm 
 2, whereby therapy was based on response at a specified time point on treatment. thus, subjects 
 randomized to arm 2 received a 4-week pr lead-in followed by boc/pr for 24 weeks; those with 
 undetectable hcv-rna at tw 8 through tw 24 completed therapy at tw 28 and entered follow-up, 
 while those with detectable hcv-rna at tw 8 or any subsequent assays and who did not 
 discontinue for virologic futility at tw 24 received an additional 20 weeks of placebo plus pr, for a 
 total treatment duration of 48 weeks. the switch from boceprevir to placebo occurred in a blinded 
 fashion. arm 3 consisted of a 4-week pr lead-in followed by 44 weeks of boc/pr. a 24-week

 primary endpoint</p><p>
 the primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two 
 therapeutic regimens of boceprevir dosed 800 mg orally (po) three times 
 daily (tid) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (peg2b) 1.5 �g/kg 
 subcutaneously (sc) once weekly (qw) plus weight-based dosing (wbd) 
 of ribavirin (600 mg/day to 1400 mg/day [rbv]) po to therapy with peg2b 
 and rbv (pr) alone in previously untreated adult subjects with chronic 
 hepatitis c (chc) (hepatitis c virus [hcv] genotype 1). the primary 
 endpoint is sustained virologic response (svr), defined as undetectable 
 hepatitis c virus-ribonucleic acid (hcv-rna) at follow-up week (fw) 24.</p><p>
 the study included two separate cohorts (cohort 1 [white subjects] and 
 cohort 2 [black subjects]). the primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed in 
 the full analysis set (fas), which included all randomized subjects who 
 received at least one dose of any study medication (peg2b, rbv, or 
 boceprevir/placebo) in cohort 1 plus cohort 2. this combined analysis 
 was based on health authority recommendations and was specified in the 
 data analysis plan. in addition, all efficacy analyses were performed by 
 cohort.</p><p>

 the key secondary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 
 two therapeutic regimens of boceprevir when used in combination with pr 
 (wbd) with the standard of care (pr [wbd] alone) in the modified intent-
 to-treat (mitt) data set, which included all randomized subjects who 
 received at least one dose of experimental study drug (placebo for the 
 control arm and boceprevir for the experimental arms).</p><p>

 endpoints</p><p>
 in addition, the two boceprevir regimens (response-guided therapy 
 [rgt] and boc/pr48) were to be compared as overall treatment 
 regimens, and the early (undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week [tw] 
 8 through tw 24) and late responders (detectable hcv-rna at tw 8 or 
 any subsequent visit by tw 24) in the rgt arm were to be compared with 
 a matched group of early and late responders in the boc/pr48 arm. 
 these latter comparisons were meant to give additional insight into the 
 questions of: 1) whether 28 weeks of therapy is sufficient for early 
 responders, and 2) whether two-drug therapy (pr) is sufficient for the last 
 20 weeks of therapy for late responders.</p><p>
 other secondary objectives of the study were as follows: 
 • to evaluate the safety of boceprevir when used in combination with pr 
 wbd). 
 • to define predictors of svr, such as epidemiologic factors, disease 
 characteristics, and on-treatment response. 
 •</p><p>to develop the relationship between steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from a population-based 
 pharmacokinetic model and responses in a subset of subjects.</p><p>

 since most of the subjects in cohort 1 were white, this group of subjects is also referred to as “white 
 subjects” in this report. cohort 2 included only subjects whose self-reported race was black. 
 in each cohort, there was a higher proportion of male subjects. in cohort 2, median weight and bmi 
 were greater and a higher proportion of subjects in each arm had hcv subtype 1a compared to 
 subjects in cohort 1. most of the subjects in both cohorts had baseline metavir fibrosis scores of f0, 
 f1, or f2, and absence of to &lt;5% steatosis. overall, the proportion of subjects with cirrhosis and 
 advanced fibrosis (f3/f4) was 9%. only 19 of the 1097 treated subjects were on statin therapy at 
 baseline.

 , the study included two separate cohorts (cohort 1 comprised of white patients and cohort 2 of black patients. due to the poor responsiveness of black subjects to interferon and their 
 underrepresentation in many trials, a second cohort (cohort 2) of black subjects was enrolled so that a 
 minimum number of black subjects (at least 150) could be evaluated separately. cohort 2 data also 
 were analyzed separately using similar data sets as for cohort 1. in addition, a combined cohort 1 plus

 in addition, the two boceprevir regimens (rgt and boc/pr48) were to be compared as overall 
 treatment regimens, and the early (undetectable hcv-rna at tw 8) and late responders (detectable 
 hcv-rna at tw 8) in the rgt arm were to be compared with a matched group of early and late 
 responders in the boc/pr48 arm. these latter comparisons were meant to give additional insight into 
 the questions of: 1) whether 28 weeks of therapy is sufficient for early responders, and 2) whether 
 two-drug therapy (pr) is sufficient for the last 20 weeks of therapy for late responders. 
 other secondary efficacy endpoints were:

 the boc/pr48 arm – 72% (59/82) versus 75% (55/73). however, it is notable that 15 patients in the rgt arm with undetectable hcv-rna levels at tw 8 had positive hcv-rna results between tw 8 and 
 tw 24 and per protocol were assigned to 48-weeks of therapy. one of these 15 patients had positive 
 hcv-rna levels at multiple time points; the other 14 patients had a single low positive hcv-rna result 
 and retesting of two additional back-up samples from the same time point (after the assignment of 
 treatment duration) showed undetectable hcv-rna results. thus, 14 patients that were probably 
 “real” early responders in the rgt arm were assigned to continue therapy with p/r for another 20 
 weeks. importantly, among these 14 patients, who were misclassified and therefore should be 
 discounted in the strict per protocol approach required when assessing what is essentially a non-
 inferiority claim (based on an underpowered study), 14/14 (100%) experienced svr. discounting 
 these patients, outcomes among late responders in the respective treatment arms look as follows, with 
 the point estimate favoring the boc/pr arm by almost 10%. of note, the only difference in received 
 therapy between these arms is the duration of boceprevir therapy – 24 or 44 weeks.</p></section><section><header>table 12.</header><p>sustained virologic response in late responders (ivrs), p05216</p><p>

 the table above represents all patients that reached treatment week 8. however, for all patients, treatment was similar up to week 36, regardless of treatment arm and early viral response. thus, no 
 events prior to week 36 could possibly be causally related to different treatment strategies within the 
 respective arm. therefore, the dataset comprising only patients reaching week 36 is considered more 
 sensitive for detecting putative differences in terms of the effect of the different treatment strategies – 
 discontinuing therapy at week 36 versus continuing for another 12 weeks in early responders, and 
 discontinuing versus continuing boceprevir for another 12 weeks in late responders. apart from being 
 more sensitive to detect differences, this dataset is also representative of the probabilities needed to 
 take into account for clinical decision-making at the time when a choice between strategies is 
 necessary. the table below shows outcomes in the subset of patients that completed 36 weeks of 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>table 19.</header><p>sustained virologic response, end of treatment response, and relapse rates in the experimental arms based on per protocol ivrs assignment</p><p> among early responders, the point estimate favoured a longer treatment duration by a statistically 
 significant 8.5% (95% ci 0.3-17%). this was, reciprocally, reflected in a significant 10.1% difference 
 in relapse rates (95% ci 3-17%), indicating that discontinuing therapy at 36 weeks in treatment 
 experienced early responders was associated with a higher risk of relapse, compared to continuing for 
 another 12 weeks. on further analysis of patients categories as per prior response, race and degree of 
 fibrosis, it is seen that, as expected, most early responders were prior relapsers rather than prior 
 partial responders, and that there is no indication that the higher relapse rates seen with shorter 
 therapy would be driven by prior partial responders. furthermore, the majority of relapses were seen 
 in non-black subjects with f1/f2 fibrosis, as seen in the table below, representing relapse rates</p><p>in early responders by previous response, race and fibrosis category.</p><p>

 in the subgroup of patients that were late responders and reached 36 weeks of therapy, the point 
 estimate for svr was higher in the rgt arm, where patients discontinued boceprevir at week 36, 
 continuing with only p/r (80% versus 72.5% in the boc/pr48 arm). while the dataset is very small 
 (n=35 and 40 respectively), there was no indication of a higher rate of viral breakthrough or relapse in 
 patients discontinuing boceprevir at week 36, and thus no positive signal of an advantage of a further 
 12 weeks of boceprevir therapy.</p></section><section><header>analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)</header><p>pharmacogenomic analysis of il28b in phase iii studies of boceprevir (sch 503034)</p><p>
 recently the association of a interleukin (il)-28b genetic polymorphism and sustained virologic 
 response in hcv genotype 1 infected subjects was described
 1 2
 . il-28b can be genotyped as cc, ct, or tt at the polymorphic site rs12979860. although the prevalence varies among racial groups, the c
 genotype provided a stronger baseline predictor of svr within each racial group than viral load, hcv 
 genotype, cirrhosis or any other known predictor of responsiveness to interferon-based therapy. 
 c</p><p> 
 the phase iii studies evaluating boc/pr versus pr were initiated prior to the identification of the 
 association of il28b with response to pr therapy.</p><p>however, a retrospective analysis has been 
 conducted with the object of determining the distribution of il28b and its relationship to svr. the 
 analyses were performed using all randomized subjects who gave informed consent for 
 pharmacogenomics (pgx) sampling and analysis, had non-missing pgx data, and received at least one 
 dose of boceprevir (experimental arms) or placebo (control arm).</p><p>
 results of testing for il28b were available for 62% and 66% of subjects who received at least one 
 dose of boceprevir or placebo in studies p05216 and p05101. the prevalence of the three genotypes in 
 the subpopulation with il28b samples was 28.4% cc, with 17.8% tt, and 53.8% ct. the cc 
 genotype was slightly less common among previous treatment failures (24.3%, study p05101) 
 compared with the population of previously untreated subjects (30.0%, p05216). see table 21 below.</p><p>

 in study p05216 the pr treatment arm (arm 1) had a significantly higher svr in subjects with the cc 
 genotype (78%) compared to those with the ct (28%) or tt (27%) genotypes. in both boceprevir 
 treatment arms there was a smaller numeric advantage to treatment in the cc genotypes compared to 
 ct or tt subjects. in the small p05101 study, it is difficult to interpret responses to placebo according 
 to genotype because of the limited numbers of subjects. furthermore, the interpretation of, e.g., a c/c 
 genotype in a patient that has failed on interferon based therapy is not straightforward, as the 
 phenotype (non-response) is not that which is characteristic of the genotype.</p></section><section><header>table 22.</header><p>svr by il28b type</p><p>
 the results of this retrospective subgroup analysis should be viewed with caution because of potential 
 differences of the sub-study population relative to the overall trial population. in fact, for all categories 
 of patients, those participating in the pharmacogenetics substudy had higher svr rates than the 
 corresponding groups of non-participants. thus the sensitivity of this analysis for detecting an added 
 value of boceprevir in c/c patients may be compromised by participant selection.</p><p>
 whether il28b genotype could reliably identify patients who are unlikely to significantly benefit form 
 the addition of boceprevir (higher svr rates or short course treatment duration) to p/r bitherapy will 
 be the subject of further investigations.</p><p>

 part 1 includes subjects who participated in a phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical study in which boceprevir was 
 administered.</p><p>
 part 2 includes subjects who participated in a phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical study in which narlaprevir

 subjects are followed for 3.5 years after the end of treatment (eot) in the previous boceprevir or

 subjects who achieved svr in the previous treatment study had isolated detectable hcv-rna results

 the lead in phase (4 weeks with the bitherapy pegylated ifn+ribavirin before the addition of the boceprevir) brings the theoretical advantage of allowing the introduction of the antiviral agent once the 
 steady state of ribavirin has been reached, i.e. under the optimal condition for the daa (to best protect 
 the daa against functional monotherapy).</p><p>
 whether or not the lead in phase increased the efficacy of this daa, was specifically assessed in the 
 phase ii study in naïve patients (p03523), with comparative arms with or without lead in phase.</p><p>this 
 phase ii study supported the lead in phase for the future development of this daa in phase iii.</p><p>
 the use of a lead in phase was associated with a trend for higher svr, lower relapses as well as lower 
 viral breakthrough. however, the difference was not statistically significant, and the virological merit of 
 the lead-in phase has not been formally demonstrated. 
 a disputable non conservative 24 weeks futility rule was predefined in the phase iii study in naïve 
 patients whereas it was set at 12 weeks (as for the soc) for treatment failure patients.</p><p>
 regarding the target population the study population excluded subjects who were co-infected with hiv 
 or hbv, subjects with decompensated liver disease, as well as null responders (as defined by a &lt;2log 
 decrease in hcv rna at week 12 during prior treatment with peg/rbv).</p><p>
 a study is on-going in the co-infected population (p05411). there is a particular medical need in this 
 population is characterized by a more pejorative evolution (in terms of natural course and response to 
 the soc).</p><p>
 concerning null responders it is noteworthy that this challenging population was excluded from the 
 phase iii study. however, the mah considers patients with a &lt; 1log decrease at the end of the 4-week 
 lead in phase to be representative of those with a prior null response, and thus to have actually studied 
 this population. on this basis, it is proposed to extend the indication to the null responder population</p><p>
 in clinical practice, however, categorization of patients relies on their historical response to the 
 bitherapy at week 12.</p><p>
 concerning black patients, these are known as being poor responders to the soc and as such 
 represent a difficult to treat population. of interest, the mah specifically addressed the question of the 
 added benefit of boceprevir to the soc in this population through a specific cohort (cohort 2) in the 
 phase iii study in naïve patients.</p><p> 
 in both phase iii studies the primary endpoint is the sustained virological response (svr) defined as 
 undetectable hcv rna 24 weeks after completion of therapy (svr24). this primary efficacy criterion is 
 in line with the eu guidelines. this svr is correlated with cure.</p><p>
 in the studies, hcv-rna viral load were determined using the roche cobas taqman hcv/hps test, 
 v2.0. the assay has a limit of quantitation of 25 iu/ml and of detection of 9.3 iu/ml. thresholds of 
 95% sensitivity can vary for a given technology which evaluated the sensitivity thus, the threshold 
 used in the trials are acceptable. 
 both phase iii studies were superiority studies, with the aim of detecting an approx 10% (in naïve, 
 response rate in soc estimated to approx 45%) to 20% (in treatment failure patients, response rate in 
 soc estimated to approx 20%)improvement in svr rate over the soc. 
 the statistical test and the approach (hierarchical order for testing null hypotheses of the 2 therapeutic 
 regimens with boc as compared to soc) are in line with the chmp guideline on multiplicity and is 
 acceptable.</p><p>

 it was recently identified that a genetic polymorphism near the il28b gene, encoding interferon-λ-3, was strongly associated with the likelihood of response to soc. recent us and eu guidelines 
 recommend stratification according to il28b genotype, but the phase iii study was initiated before the 
 release of these recommendations. more recently, a genetic variant leading to inosine triphosphatase 
 (itpa) deficiency has been associated with risk of ribavirin-related anaemia during pr therapy.</p><p>a</p><p>

 the high level of statistical significance [p&lt;0.0001, for each boceprevir arm vs control] confers 
 robustness in the demonstration.</p><p>addition of boc to soc confered a significant improvement of svr in both the prior relapser patients 
 (δ=40-46%) and the prior partial responders patients (δ=33-45%) as demonstrated in the respond -
 2 trial. such results translate into a svr reaching 75% in relapser patients and a svr reaching 52% in 
 prior partial responders. the high level of statistical significance (p&lt;0.0001) provides robustness in the 
 efficacy demonstration. 
 regarding il28b, data from a retrospective analysis suggest that for naïve subjects with cc genotype 
 the addition of boceprevir to pegifn and ribavirin does not substantially improve response rates and as 
 such the added value of boceprevir in patients with good prognostic factors of response to pr may be 
 questioned. however it is important to highlight that more patients in the treatment arm benefited 
 from a shorter treatment duration than patients treated with bitherapy alone. for naïve subjects with 
 ct or tt genotype, the addition of boceprevir to pegifn and ribavirin seems to improve response rates 
 (below 30% versus 55% to 71%). for pretreated subjects addition of boceprevir seems to improve 
 response rates for all genotypes. however, as the numbers of pretreated patients is small and the 
 pharmacogenomic analysis was done in a subset of patients and baseline characteristics between the 
 subset included in the pharmacogenomic analysis was not completely balanced with that of the not 
 included subset, all these findings are uncertain. the mah highlighted the limitations of the exploratory 
 analysis and that the on treatment early viral response could be a stronger predictor of svr. 
 furthermore it was highlighted that</p><p>there are uncertainties on the clinical utility of il28b genotyping 
 in clinical practice.</p><p>
 it was agreed that only a prospective study will help to draw formal conclusion on the clinical utility of 
 il28b genotyping. the smpc reflects the currently available level of information.</p><p>appropriate treatment durations for different patient categories</p><p>based on phase ii data, the concept of a treatment duration tailored to the early kinetics of virologic response has emerged (i.e. the response guided therapy/rgt). this concept was then formally tested 
 in the two phase iii studies.</p><p>
 treatment naïve early responders received either 28 weeks of total therapy (4 weeks lead in + 24 
 weeks of triple therapy) or 48 weeks of total therapy (4 weeks lead in + 44 weeks of total therapy). 
 treatment naïve late responders received either (a) 4 weeks of lead in, followed by 24 weeks of triple 
 therapy, and then another 20 weeks of p/r, or (b) 4 weeks of lead in followed by 44 weeks of triple 
 therapy. treatment experienced early responders received either 4 weeks of lead in followed by 32

 weeks of triple therapy, or 4 weeks of lead in, followed by 44 weeks of triple therapy. treatment experienced late responders received either (a) 4 weeks of lead in, followed by 32 weeks of triple 
 therapy, and then another 12 weeks of p/r, or (b) 4 weeks of lead in, followed by 44 weeks of triple 
 therapy.</p><p>
 svr rates for treatment naïve early responders in p05216 that were treated for a total of 28 weeks, 
 comprising about 45% of the studied treatment naïve populations, were very high, and similar to what 
 was seen with 48 weeks of treatment. relapse rates were low in both arms, with no indication of 
 different relapse rates. on this basis, a relatively solid inference about the appropriateness of response 
 guided therapy in treatment naïve patients can be drawn, with early responders receiving 4 weeks lead 
 in + 24 weeks of triple therapy. 
 concerning treatment naïve late responders, results from the p05216 study summarized above 
 indicate that 24 weeks is too short in this subset, as discontinuing therapy at this time is associated by 
 an apparent increase in viral breakthrough rates, as described above. however, data do not indicate 
 what would be the optimal duration - that is, whether 20 weeks of further exposure to boceprevir is 
 necessary, or if boceprevir treatment can be discontinued earlier, for instance at week 32. this has not 
 been studied in treatment naïve patients, but it has been investigated in the treatment experienced 
 population comprising of prior relapsers and prior partial responders. as stated above, approximately 
 45% of boceprevir treated patients qualified as early responders and were treated for 28 weeks. this 
 roughly corresponds to the svr rate in treatment naïve patients exposed to p/r. thus, the late 
 responder population would likely primarily consist of a mixture of would-be p/r relapsers, partial 
 responders and null responders. this implies a rationale for looking at the outcomes of the p05101 
 study, were the virological efficacy of 32 weeks total boceprevir therapy (late responders, rgt arm) 
 and 44 weeks total boceprevir therapy (late responders, boc/pr48 arm) was directly compared. this 
 small dataset failed to indicate any efficacy difference between 32 and 44 weeks of boceprevir 
 exposure in prior relapsers and prior non-responders that are late responders to boceprevir based 
 therapy. the point estimate in fact favors 32 weeks of boceprevir therapy, and the relapse rate is 
 similar. what can further be inferred from the eot response, which is higher in the rgt arm (32 weeks 
 of boceprevir), is that, as opposed to the case with 24 weeks of boceprevir therapy in treatment naïve 
 late responsers, there was no excess of viral breakthroughs when boceprevir was dosed for 32 weeks, 
 in comparison to 44 weeks. 
 now, it may be argued that this was demonstrated in a different population, but as stated above, the 
 baseline interferon responsiveness in the subpopulation of treatment experienced late responders is 
 likely to largely overlap with that of treatment naïve late responders. therefore, a reasonable guess on 
 available evidence is that 32 weeks would be sufficient for maximizing svr rates in most interferon 
 responder strata. in light of the safety profile of boceprevir, risk/benefit is considered to likely be more 
 positive with 32 than with 48 weeks of therapy, though the uncertainties of this inference are 
 acknowledged. on this basis it is proposed that the boceprevir regimen for treatment naïve late 
 responders is 4 weeks of lead in + 32 weeks of triple therapy, followed by 12 weeks of p/r. 
 in treatment experienced early responders that were randomized to the rgt arm, and thus received 4 
 weeks of lead in followed by 32 weeks of triple therapy, svr rates were lower than in corresponding 
 patients randomized to 44 weeks of triple therapy. when looking at the dataset consisting of patients 
 that actually received 36 weeks of similar therapy, a roughly 10% difference in svr in favor of the 
 longer duration is entirely explained by higher relapse rates in patients receiving a shorter duration of 
 therapy. the 95% confidence limits of this difference are compatible with a 17% higher relapse rate in 
 case of discontinuation of therapy at week 36. 
 it is recognized that this dataset is small, and that the difference is driven by less than 10 events. the 
 uncertainty of the inference, due to the limited size of the dataset, is clear. nonetheless, the likely

 equivalence of a 36 and a 48 week total duration of therapy in treatment experienced patients is not considered sufficiently demonstrated in the light of these outcomes, with all recorded relapses taking 
 place in the shorter treatment duration arm. therefore, treatment experienced early responders should 
 continue therapy after week 36. as already stated above, there is no indication that extending 
 boceprevir therapy beyond 32 weeks is of any value in treatment experienced late responders. by 
 inference, no benefit is expected in treatment experienced early responders either. therefore, the 
 difference seen in the early responder subset is attributed to the effect of continued p/r medication, 
 and the recommended regimen for treatment experienced early responders is 4 weeks lead in, 32 
 weeks of triple therapy, followed by 12 weeks of p/r consolidation. 
 the recommended treatment regimen for treatment experienced late responders is 4 weeks lead in 
 followed by 32 weeks of triple therapy, followed by 12 weeks of p/r. the rationale for a total of 32 
 rather than 44 weeks of therapy has been described above. there is no evidence for an added benefit 
 of boceprevir use beyond week 36. 
 cirrhotics represent a special case. very few patients with the most advanced degree of liver 
 histopathology were included in the boceprevir trials. no conclusion can be made on the optimal 
 treatment duration in cirrhotics from these data. an important consideration in cirrhotics is that this 
 subgroup contains the patients in whom achieving an svr may be expected to have the most 
 immediate clinical consequences. thus, a particularly conservative approach to optimizing the 
 likelihood of response can be motivated in this group. on the other hand, they may be the most 
 sensitive to some boceprevir side effects, particularly thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. therefore 
 the primary recommendation 4 weeks lead in + 44 weeks of triple therapy. however, the smpc should 
 clearly state that adequate monitoring of side effects is tantamount, and that boceprevir should be 
 discontinued if the side effect profile of the patients indicate that the risks may outweigh the benefits. 
 also for prior null responders, for whom the evidence of efficacy of boceprevir is altogether indirect, 
 treatment durations of 4+44 weeks are primarily recommended.</p><p>
 stopping rules</p><p> 
 in the phase iii studies the stopping rules were different for naïve and treatment experienced patients. a disputable non conservative 24 weeks futility rule was predefined in the phase iii study in naïve 
 patients whereas it was set at 12 weeks (as for the soc) for treatment experienced patients. the mah 
 was asked to justify why conservative measures are not equally proposed for both naïve and treatment 
 experienced patients.</p><p>
 the question is, should physician do something between week 12 and week 24, to avoid unduly 
 keeping a treatment naïve patient under unchanged treatment whereas no benefit can be anticipated 
 (and only risk). 
 the following futility rule that would be applicable for both treatment naïve and prior treatment failure 
 patients are proposed: discontinue all 3 drugs if hcv rna is ≥100 iu/ml at treatment week 12; 
 discontinue all 3 drugs if hcv rna is detectable at treatment week 24. 
 these stopping rules</p><p>simplifies the posology of victrelis because the same futility rule is used for both 
 treatment naïve and previous treatment failure patients, and because the treatment week (tw) 12 
 and 24 time points are already part of the standard of care for monitoring hcv rna testing during 
 therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin. 
 the futility rule is based on the observations in the phase 3 program that patients with hcv rna levels 
 ≥100 iu/ml at tw 12 are unlikely to achieve svr; and patients with low levels of detectable hcv rna 
 at tw12 still had a substantial possibility of achieving svr.

 ema/chmp/393216/2012</p><p>
 page 53/78</p><p>the implementation of a stopping rule at tw12 (hcv rna ≥100 iu/ml) means that only patients with very low (or undetectable) hcv rna levels will remain on treatment after tw12, and therefore it is</p><p>
 not considered necessary that additional hcv rna testing occurs between tw12 and tw24.</p><p>null responders</p><p>prior null response to p/r therapy was an exclusion criteria from the pivotal study respond 2/p05101 in treatment experienced. despite this exclusion criteria, the mah claimed that clinical experience was 
 gained in “null responders” by using the lead in phase to re-qualify patients (&lt;1 log copies/ml at week 
 4).</p><p>
 the mah highlights that there is a close correlation between the historical week 12 response to prior 
 treatment (&lt;2 log copies/ml) and the week 4 on treatment (&lt;1 log copies/ml). furthermore when 
 applying the week 4 definition of null responders, a significant benefit of the tritherapy is shown in 
 respond 2/p05101 over the pr in this challenging population (rgt 33%, no rgt 34%, pr 0%). while 
 a lead in response of &lt;1 log10 is not considered a sufficiently sensitive substitute for null response 
 (defined as &lt;2log10 decline at week 12, it is recognised that the findings in this category are 
 supported by outcomes in the still more strictly defined subgroup of patients with &lt;0.5 log10 decline 
 during the lead in. among such patients 0% reached svr in the control arm, whereas 28-30% reached 
 svr in the boceprevir arms (pooled cohort 1 +2).</p><p>
 the total sample size underlying this point estimate is 84 patients (versus 25 patients in the p/r arm). 
 thus, there is hardly any doubt that boceprevir increases svr rates in null responders, though an 
 exact estimate of the magnitude of this effect is not available.</p><p>
 overall, given the medical need in this population and waiting for further option, it is recognised that 
 access to the drug should not be hampered by exclusion from the indication, however a statement is 
 reflected in the boceprevir product information.</p></section><section><header>assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy</header><p>no clinical studies in paediatric patients have been carried out.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>boceprevir provides higher rates of svr as compared to the current standard of care with peginterferon alfa+ribavirin (pr). the gain of svr in the phase iii/sprint 2-p05216) in treatment 
 naïve patients was of the magnitude of approximately 30%. in the phase iii/respond 2-p05101 in 
 treatment experienced the gain was approximately 40%. for both studies, superiority over placebo+ 
 p/r was established with p&lt;0.0001. 
 regarding il28b, data from a retrospective analysis question the added benefit of boceprevir in 
 patients with good prognostic factors of response to pr. the limitations of the retrospective analysis 
 are recognized and leave a level of uncertainty concerning the predictive value of il28b that requires 
 addressing by means of a prospective trial. a prospective study will be carried out to help draw formal 
 conclusion on the clinical utility of il28b genotyping.</p><p>
 concerning the rgt, for treatment naive patients, a shorter treatment duration of 4 plus 24 weeks 
 tritherapy is accepted for early responders. for treatment naive late responders and treatment 
 experienced early and late responders the 4w pr+32w bpr+12 w pr appears an adequate balance 
 between maximising svr and the risks of prolonged exposure of tritherapy, notably anaemia.</p><p>

 regarding patients with cirrhosis, the number of cirrhotic patients is overall very limited and mandates particular caution in terms of treatment recommendations. in these patients, a recommendation to 
 maximise the tritherapy period until 48 weeks is given. however, taking into account that these 
 patients are particularly challenging to manage in clinical practice due their hematological 
 abnormalities, the feasibility of pursuing the tritherapy with the incremental risk of anaemia is 
 uncertain. therefore, this decision should be adapted according to the patients tolerance to treatment 
 beyond 32 weeks. the same recommendation should apply for the challenging null responders 
 patients. 
 null responders where excluded for the phase iii trials, however given the medical need in this 
 population and waiting for further options, it has been admitted that access to the drug should not be 
 hampered by exclusion from the indication. furthermore it can be acknowledged that the addition of 
 boceprevir might increase the likelihood of achieving svr in null responders waiting for optimal 
 therapeutic management that might require in the future combination of antiviral agents.</p></section><section><header n="2.4">2.4 clinical safety</header></section><section><header>patient exposure</header><p>during the course of clinical development of boceprevir, approximately 2827 subjects were exposed to any dose of boceprevir in 28 clinical trials, including 20 phase i studies, three phase ii studies, and five

 week boc/pr arms and the 48- week pr control arms in each of the two studies. if a safety advantage 
 of arm 2 rgt over boc/pr48 was observed, then a secondary comparison of safety was made 
 between the shorter rgt arm (in early virologic responders) and the longer rgt arm within arm 2 of 
 each study. 
 there were similar proportions of subjects with treatment-related aes, and dose modifications due to 
 ae in the rgt arms compared with the boc/pr 48-week arms in both studies. 
 when the shorter rgt treatment arms are compared with the longer rgt arms, there are fewer saes 
 and study drug discontinuations in the early virologic responders who qualified for shorter treatment in 
 both the treatment-naïve and previous treatment failure study populations. there were similar

 proportions of subjects with treatment-related aes, and d, in ose modifications due to ae in the short and long rgt arms. 
 the safety differences between the shorter vs longer duration of therapy in arm 2 are confounded by 
 differences in the demographic characteristics of both groups. in study p05216, subjects who qualified 
 for shorter duration of treatment compared to long treatment were more likely to be white (88% vs 
 79%) and have a lower mean bmi (27.7 vs 28.5 kg/m

 vs 54.0 years). 
 the pattern with respect to timing of onset of events appeared similar when comparing the pr and 
 boc/pr arms. most (98-99%) subjects reported at least one ae early, within the first 28 weeks of 
 treatment. after tw 28, however, 67% of pr-treated subjects and 70% of boc/pr-treated subjects 
 had the new onset of at least one ae. hematologic events and fatigue were reported with new onset 
 after tw 28 by ≥5% of subjects in both pr- and boc/prtreated subjects.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</header><p>deaths eight subjects died in the key studies: one in study p03523, boceprevir arm (drug cocaine toxicity)

 studies had 4-week pr lead-in), hgb concentrations continued to decline up to tw 6 to tw 8. in these 
 studies, the change in hgb over time beyond tw 8 was confounded by the use of epo in approximately

 an additional ~1 g/dl decrement in hgb concentrations was observed in the boceprevir-containing 
 arms.</p></section><section><header>mean hemoglobin concentration over time by treatment arm in the key studies</header><p>multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify baseline and disease characteristics associated with anaemia. in the treatment-naïve populations of studies p03523 and p05216 and using 
 the full model, treatment with boceprevir, low baseline hgb, female sex and age &gt;40 were significant 
 factors for developing anaemia (treatment [boc/pr vs control, or 2.9, p&lt;0.0001], baseline hgb [or 
 0.6, p&lt;0.0001], sex [female vs male, or 1.9, p&lt;0.003], and age [≤40 vs &gt;40 years, or 0.4, 
 p&lt;0.0001]). 
 multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed to identify baseline and disease 
 characteristics associated with anaemia in the previous treatment–failure population in study p05101. 
 similar risk factors for anaemia were seen compared to the treatment-naïve population, with the 
 addition of race: non-black being associated with an increased risk. 
 ae terms potentially representing clinical symptoms of anaemia were selected. aes that are 
 characteristic of anaemia were reported with similar frequency in the pr (76%) and boc/pr arms 
 (80%). the most common (≥10%) events in each arm were fatigue (57% pr, 57% boc/pr), asthenia 
 (18% pr, 16% boc/pr), dyspnea (16% pr, 19% boc/pr), and dizziness (14% pr, 17% boc/pr).</p><p>

 the anaemia was managed by rbv dose reduction alone in 10% and 7% of pr-treated and boc/pr-
 treated subjects, respectively; with erythropoietin use alone in 37% and 33% of subjects, respectively, 
 and with both rbv dose reduction and erythropoietin use in 32% and 46% of subjects, respectively. in 
 21% of pr-treated subjects and 14% of boc/pr-treated subjects with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl, neither of 
 these methods were retorted to. 
 in total epo was used in 131/547 (24%) patients in pr arms and 667/1548 (43%) in boc/pr arms. 
 medically important aes potentially attributable to the use of erythropoietin, such as cardiovascular 
 events, thrombotic or thromboembolic events were evaluated. these events occurred with similar 
 frequency in subjects who received epo and those who did not (4% and 6%, respectively). 
 one case of arterial thrombosis resulting in below-the-knee amputation in a 56-year old black female 
 with stable hypertension was observed in study p05216 arm 3 (boc/pr48). the investigator assessed 
 the event as possibly related to epo.

 received boceprevir or placebo + pegylated interferon alfa2b and ribavirin 600 to 1400 mg/day during 
 48 weeks.</p><p>
 the study is currently ongoing. a three month safety update is available from this study with the cut

 as of 1 december 2010, 93 subjects had been enrolled and had received at least one dose of pr and 88 subjects had reached tw 4 and received at least one dose of boceprevir or placebo. median 
 treatment duration was 141 days.</p><p>
 as of the safety update report, the treatment phase was ongoing for 75 (81%) of the 93 treated 
 subjects and the follow-up phase was ongoing for 13 of the 16 subjects who had entered follow-up 18 
 (19% had discontinued treatment and 8 (9%) discontinued treatment due to aes. 
 no deaths were reported during this study as the cut off date of 01 december 2010. 10 subjects 
 (11%) experienced saes including two subjects who had a sae of anaemia. 
 the other saes concerned gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue and influenza like illness, 1 neurotoxicity 
 and 1 agitation. there was also a sae of ventricular fibrillation.</p><p>
 regarding anaemia, the protocol provided guideline for the use of epo. however, the decision whether 
 to use epo or reduce the ribavirin dose was made at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>

 subject, in the severe impairment group, reported one ae of vomiting during the study which was mild 
 in intensity and possibly related to treatment. there were no death, no sae and no subject who 
 discontinued because of an ae. 
 the safety of boceprevir was also evaluated in renally-impaired subjects (6 healthy subjects and 8 
 subjects with end stage renal disease (esrd). in this study, healthy subjects received one 800mg 
 single dose of boceprevir. renally impaired subjects received a second 800mg single dose to determine 
 the effect of dialysis. 
 a total of 2 subjects (14%) (both in the esrd group) reported 3 aes (ventricular extrasystoles and 
 flatulence in one subject and catether thrombosis in another subject) of moderate severity and which 
 were considered unlikely related to treatment. there were no death, no sae and no subject who 
 discontinued because of an ae.</p></section><section><header>safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</header><p>a total of five clinical drug-interactions studies in healthy subjects were conducted in the boceprevir clinical pharmacology program. boceprevir interactions with the akr inhibitors ibuprofen and diflunisal; 
 the cyp 3a4/5 inhibitors clarithromycin, ketoconazole, and ritonavir; the cyp3a4/5 inducer efavirenz, 
 the cyp3a4/5 substrate midazolam, the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and an oral 
 contraceptive have been studied. 
 overall, no important safety concern was raised from these drug-drug interactions studies. 
 in the key studies, the following cyp3a4/5 substrates, inhibitors and inducers were also examined as 
 concomitant medications: 
  substrates: hmg- coa reductase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, methadone, oral contraceptives

  other: antidepressants</p><p>
 in general, subjects using these drugs (statins, calcium channel blockers, macrolides antibiotics, oral 
 contraceptives and methadone) in the boc/pr or in the pr-treatment arms had a similar safety profile 
 than those that did not use them. there were no clinically relevant adverse events reported with 
 significant different frequency in both treatment groups. however, the number of subjects using these 
 drugs concomitantly was limited.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation due to adverse events</header><p>discontinuation due to aes</p><p> overall, there was no difference between the pr control (12%) and boc/pr (13%) arms in percentage of subjects that experienced aes that resulted in study discontinuation. in the study in pretreated 
 patients (p05101), there were fewer discontinuations due to aes in the pr control arm (3%) compared 
 to the boc/pr arms (10%); while in the studies in naive patients this was comparable 14% for control 
 as well as experimental arms. events resulting in discontinuation were anaemia, asthenia, fatigue, 
 nausea, depression, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>
 although overall discontinuation is comparable between control and experimental treatment, when 
 incidence is corrected for exposure the incidence of anaemia and neutropenia leading to 
 discontinuation appear to be higher in the experimental arms compared to control. the lower exposure 
 rate in the pr arms is due to the higher treatment failures (futility rule).

 the proportion of subjects with peg2b dose modifications was similar in the pr arms and boc/pr 
 arms; however, the boceprevir-containing arms had a greater proportion of subjects with rbv dose 
 reduction (29%) than did the pr control arm (16%). in subjects with anaemia (hgb &lt;10 g/dl), the

 subjects, respectively; with epo use alone in 37% and 33% of subjects, respectively, and with both 
 rbv dose reduction and epo use in 32% and 46% of subjects, respectively. none of these methods

 dose modification compared with the control arm. the difference was more marked in pre-treated 
 patients than in naïve patients. 
 the most frequently reported adverse reactions in boceprevir treatment arms were comparable to 
 those reported in the control arm, i.e flu-like syndrome (fatigue, chills, headache), hematologic 
 disorders and (anaemia) and gastrointestinal disorders. however, compared with the control arm, the 
 addition of boceprevir increased significantly the risk of developing anaemia, neutropenia and 
 gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea, nausea but also in a higher extent dysgueusia. 
 there was by contrast no apparent increase of the risk of having other ifn –related adverse reactions, 
 such as psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disorders or endocrine disorders. 
 the most significant aspect of the safety profile of the drug is the high rate of anaemia and dysgueusia 
 that occurred in 49% and 37% of boceprevir-treated subjects respectively. 
 regarding dysgueusia, this event generally did not lead to study drug discontinuation (only in 2 
 patients in the clinical development program) and few events were judged serious by the investigator. 
 more problematic is the occurrence of anaemia since decrease in hb &lt; 10 g/dl was reported twice as 
 often in boceprevir-treated subject compared with placebo-treated subjects (49% versus 29% 
 respectively). in summary, the addition of boceprevir to soc was reflected by an additional decrease 
 of hb of approximately 1 g/dl versus -2.5 to 3.5 g/dl with peginterferon and ribavirin only. 
 consequently, the proportion of subjects who required dose reduction of antiviral therapy and/or the 
 use of erythropoietin was much higher in boceprevir treatment arms, whatever the studied population 
 (naïve or pre-treated). more boceprevir-treated patients also required transfusion.</p><p>

 the mechanism of boceprevir-induced anaemia, has not been elucidated.</p><p>the benefit /risk ratio of epo in the management of hcv therapy-induced anaemia requires further 
 substantiation even though a scientific rational is admitted to support its use in this context. globally, 
 as part of the assessment of the maa of boceprevir, it is important to ensure that the need of using 
 epo due to anaemia in more of 40% of boceprevir-treated subjects does not induce additional safety 
 concerns. 
 regarding this issue, the mah</p><p>has explored the safety data in patients who received epo in the clinical 
 development program. in terms of safety, there was no apparent increased risk of developing adverse 
 events commonly associated with erythropoietin in epo users versus non epo users in the boceprevir 
 development program. a slight increase of thrombo-embolic events is however observed in boceprevir 
 –treated subjects who receive epo (1.2%) versus those who did not receive epo (0.7%). this slight 
 increase is mainly driven by a slight higher percentage of deep vein thrombosis (0.6% vs 0.2%) and 
 pulmonary embolism (0.3% vs 0.1%). globally, these differences were not unexpected due to the 
 known safety profile of epo. 
 more problematic is the occurrence of one serious of pure red cell anaemia (prca) with anti-epo 
 antibodies in the boceprevir clinical development program (with an incidence of 1.5 per 1000 patients). 
 reassuringly, the patient fully recovered and was no longer transfusion dependant.</p><p>the occurrence of 
 prca cannot be attributed to boceprevir only, rather to tritherapy and use of epo.</p><p>it is likely that the 
 immunomodulatory effect of ifn and the impact of the underlying disease itself may increase the risk 
 of developing prca in patients co-receiving epo.</p><p>
 overall, it is difficult to ascertain based on the available data whether anaemia can be adequately 
 managed with only rbv dose reduction without impacting on the efficacy results of the tritherapy.</p><p>in 
 some situations where the anaemia is not very pronounced it may be easily manageable with low 
 ribavirin dose reduction. however, if high dose reduction of rbv is required for severe hb level 
 decrease, one can not exclude an impact on efficacy and other measures may be considered in practice 
 in order to maintain rbv concentrations and achieve better response rates.</p><p>
 the addition of boceprevir to standard of care was also associated to an increased risk of developing 
 neutropenia and grade 3/4 neutropenia and, in a lesser extent, to an increased risk of developing 
 thrombocytopenia.</p><p>
 due to the potential increased risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia-related infections, it is important that 
 physicians are alerted on this concern and the need of monitoring this potential adverse reaction by a 
 warning in section 4.4 of victrelis smpc. the risk of neutropenia was identified as being further 
 increased when boceprevir was combined with pegylated interferon alfa 2a as compared to alfa 2b.</p><p>
 four cases of thyroid neoplasm were reported in the key studies, all of which represented thyroid 
 nodules based on the literal terms provided by the investigators.</p><p>two cases occurred in boc/pr-
 treated patients. taking together the pre-clinical findings which cannot exclude an effect on the thyroid 
 hormone levels and the thyroid gland, the 2 cases in clinical studies where the contribution of 
 boceprevir could not be excluded and was assessed as ‘probable’ thyroid neoplasm is included in the 
 boceprevir smpc as are the reported aes goitre, hypo- and hyperthyroidisms.</p><p>safety with response guided therapy in the key studies p05216 and p05101 two of the key safety studies included a response –guided therapy (rgt) arm in which subjects were assigned to either a 28- or a 48-week treatment duration (study p05216 in treatment-naïve subjects) 
 or a 36- or 48-week treatment duration (study p05101 in previous peg/r treatment failures ) based 
 upon their on-treatment virologic response at week 8.

 this offers the opportunity to shorten the treatment duration for a proportion of patients achieving undetectable hcv-rna at week 8 (early virologic responders). 
 the benefit of the rgt in terms of reduction of adverse events is not striking although it may offer the 
 advantage to reduce the occurrence of such late-occurring events in patient who had undetectable hcv 
 rna at week 8. 
 in terms of laboratory findings, excluding hematology disorders, the mah has presented an analysis of 
 liver function tests across studies that did not reveal safety concern. an analysis of other blood 
 chemistry values revealed that the addition of boceprevir to peginterferon/ribavirin is associated with 
 higher incidences of increase in uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol total. a slight higher rate of gout 
 was observed in boceprevir-treated subjects. although the clinical impact of these findings was 
 probably low due to the limited treatment duration. the boceprevir smpc reflects these findings. 
 regarding the impact on qt/qtc prolongation, the assessment of the thorough qt/qtc study 
 performed according to ich e14 guideline was overall reassuring with negative results, however there 
 was some dose dependent trend toward a prolongation of the qt interval. in addition, there was some 
 concerns raised in relation to the preclinical studies regarding this issue. as such</p><p>a thorough review 
 for any signal of potential proarrhythmic effect of boceprevir has been made. no patient in either 
 treatment group experienced torsades de pointes, qt prolongation, a ventricular arrhythmia, or 
 sudden death. overall although it can be concurred with the mah</p><p>that the clinical data are reassuring 
 so far, it remains that boceprevir has a proarrhytmic potential based on electrophysiological findings 
 and the trend observed toward a prolongation of the qt interval in the dedicated iche14 study.</p><p>
 the cardiac safety profile will continue to be assessed when boceprevir will be prescribed in normal 
 condition of use.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.2">2.4.2 conclusions on the clinical safety</header><p>globally, the addition of boceprevir to peginterferon plus rbv/standard of care led to a slight increase in the rate of serious adverse events and the rate of adverse events leading to study drug 
 discontinuation or dose modification compared with the control arm. the difference was more marked 
 in pre-treated patients than in naïve patients. 
 however the main safety concern associated with the use of boceprevir is the marked increase of 
 anaemia as compared to the already significant rate of anaemia with the soc.</p><p>although the available 
 data provide some degree of reassurance, the clinical dossier so far does not allow to fully appreciate 
 to what extent the management of the substantial incremental anaemia induced by boceprevir on top 
 of pr could per se negatively affect the benefit-risk balance of boceprevir, having in mind that on the 
 one hand ribavirin dose reduction could potentially alter the benefit and on the other hand the epo 
 use, through its safety profile (associated with risk of prca and thrombosis events), could alter the 
 risk. additional investigations are being undertaken in this context.</p></section><section><header n="2.5">2.5 risk management plan</header><p>the safety specifications, pharmacovigilance plans, and risk minimisation activities of combination therapy of boceprevir, when used in the context of approved tritherapy with pegintron</p><p>and ribavirin,

 the results of both phase iii studies show a significant improvement of svr over standard of care 
 (peg/rbv), of around 30% in treatment naïve patients (p05216/sprint 2) and 40% in treatment 
 experienced patients (p05101/respond 2). 
 in addition, treatment naïve early responders could benefit from a significant reduction of the total 
 treatment duration (28 weeks as compared to 48 weeks with the current bitherapy). when considering 
 the burden of treatment, this benefit is worthy of being taken into consideration.</p><p>
 given that svr is correlated with cure, the addition of boceprevir to the current soc will significantly 
 increase the individual likelihood of being cured, avoiding progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
 carcinoma.</p><p>
  uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.</p><p>
 recently the importance of patient genotype il28b as a strong predictor of svr in hcv genotype 1 
 infected patients became known. this was after the start of the phase iii studies. thus patients were 
 not stratified for this baseline characteristic. this information was only available for approximately 60% 
 of treatment naïve and pretreated patients (patients who gave their informed consent). 
 although overall addition of boc to pr resulted in significant higher svr rates, pharmacogenomic 
 analysis in which svr rates were evaluated according to patients il28b genotype, indicate that 
 treatment naïve patients with genotype il28b cc might not substantially benefit from additional 
 boceprevir to pr, contrary to patients with il28b genotype ct or tt.</p><p>
 taking into account the particular burden of anaemia, measures have been put in place within the 
 boceprevir marketing authorisation to address the chmp concerns (see victrelis epar).</p><p>
 as</p><p>a shortened duration of therapy might not be considered appropriate if this results in a net loss of 
 efficacy,</p><p>shortened treatment duration has not been found approvable for treatment experienced early 
 responders. 
 the treatment experienced population in the phase iii study, excluded the challenging population of 
 null responders qualified as such based on their prior response to pegylated ifn and interferon at 
 week 12. based on a retrospective analysis performed with requalifying on the basis of their on 
 treatment virologic response at treatment week 4 (using the peginterferon alfa/ribavirin lead in period) 
 as compared to baseline, it was admitted that null responders might gain some benefit in adding 
 victrelis to the bitherapy. however, this cannot be reliably quantified from the retrospective analysis.

 moreover, the optimal management of null responders remains to be established and might in the future require antiviral combination.</p><p>
 the proportion of patients with cirrhosis is limited, with only 100/1097 (9%) in the phase iii in naïve 
 patients and 49/403 (12%) in the phase iii in treatment experienced patients.</p></section><section><header>risks</header><p> unfavourable effects</p><p>
 the main safety concern with boceprevir is the increase in the risk of anaemia as compared to 
 bitherapy forty-nine percent of boceprevir-treated patients experienced anaemia &lt; 10 g/dl during 
 treatment versus 29% in placebo-treated subjects.</p><p>
  uncertainty in the benefits of the product</p><p>
 one of the main areas of uncertainty is to what extent anaemia associated with the use of boceprevir 
 in combination with standard or care can be managed without epo, taking into account the need for 
 sufficient ribavirin exposure, and also taking into account that the use of epo raises safety concerns 
 (risk of prca notably) and could impact the benefit risk balance. 
 overall even though the data at the time of opinion provide sufficient reassurance, the clinical dossier 
 so far does not allow to fully appreciate to what extent the management of the substantial incremental 
 anaemia induced by boceprevir on top of pr could per se negatively affect the benefit-risk balance of 
 boceprevir, taking into account that ribavirin dose reduction could potentially alter the benefit and on 
 the other hand the epo could alter the risk.</p><p>
 as such measures have been put in place for the mah of boceprevir to address these concerns.</p><p>
 the clinical consequence of resistance to boceprevir (in terms of response to boceprevir and impact to 
 subsequent lines of therapies) is unknown. 
 electrophysiological data carries some concerns as regards the cardiotoxicity of the drug in real life 
 (co-administration, electrophysiological disturbances). attention of physicians is warranted by a 
 specific statement in the smpc and this issue will be monitored in pharmacovigilance.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance</header><p> benefit-risk balance</p><p>
 boceprevir has been shown to significantly increase the percentage of treatment naïve and treatment 
 experienced patients chronically infected by hcv genotype 1 achieving sustained virologic response 
 (correlated with cure) and will reduce the treatment duration for some patients.</p><p>
 considering the limited response rate achieved so far with the peg-ifn+ ribavirin in patients 
 chronically infected with hcv genotype 1 and given the burden of such a treatment, this represents a 
 significant therapeutic advance. 
 this benefit is regarded as overweighing the safety issues associated with this drug, even though the 
 incremental anaemia and perhaps also neutropenia is anticipated as being a particular burden in 
 clinical practice.</p><p>

 for patients with the favourable cc genotype further substantiation of the added benefit of boceprevir to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is warranted, it is however noted that a higher proportion of patients 
 treated with tritherapy will benefit form a shorter treatment duration as compared to treatment with
