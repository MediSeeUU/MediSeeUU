 in 2004, the results from this study concerning patients infected with hcv genotype 2/3 were 
 reviewed by the chmp leading to a revised spc, including a recommendation for a treatment period 
 of 24 weeks in these patients in contrast to patients infected with virus genotype 1 (48 weeks). 
 previously, in september 2003, the chmp had been informed about the results in patients infected 
 with hcv genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt;600,000 iu/ml). a non-planned interim analysis showed 
 that the relapse rate overall was clearly higher in these patients than seen in the previous 48-week 
 study.</p><p>further analyses indicated that time to initial loss of detectable hcv-rna might be predictive of 
 relapse rate. 
 the chmp requested the mah to confirm these results with respect to patients showing early 
 response in a second cohort of patients (including already enrolled patients but not analysed + new 
 patients if needed). the mah has now provided these results. 
 the type ii variation is aimed to modify the duration of treatment of pegylated interferon in 
 combination with ribavirin to 24 weeks in hcv genotype 1 infected patients with low viral load who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 (sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the spc are affected).</p></section><section><header>clinical aspects</header><p>study p01882 diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: adult, treatment naïve subjects with chronic hepatitis c who were infected with hcv genotype 1, viral load &lt;600,000 iu/ml.</p><p>

 patients were recruited from 43 centres in europe. characteristics were similar across weight-based 
 ribavirin dose groups. the percentage of males is smaller than in studies without selection based on 
 viral load. similarly, fibrosis score is low. the low withdrawal rate is notable. treatment compliance 
 (allowing for dose-reductions according to protocol, etc.) was very high, about 98%.

 participating in the unplanned analysis are excluded, the svr is 92% (95% ci 82; 97%) confirming 
 that on-therapy data are highly predictive of final outcome.</p><p>
 pre-treatment viral load predicted for svr and a viral load of 250,000 iu/ml was shown to best 
 discriminate between sustained responders and non-responders. a low viral load was as expected also 
 associated with early response to therapy, but the sustained response rate in patients with viral load ≤ 
 250,000 at baseline seems lower (67%, 93/138) than in patients responding at week 4. 
 weight was not predictive. normalisation of alt was highly correlated with svr.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>the overall safety profile of the drug combination observed in this study is consistent with that seen in previous clinical research studies and clinical experience described in the literature; no novel events

 an unplanned interim analysis was conducted as there were signals indicating that the overall relapse rate was higher than expected. this suspicion was confirmed, but in an exploratory subgroup analysis 
 it was found that patients responding at week 4 had a sustained response rate of 41/47(95% ci 78; 
 97%). this high sustained response rate was confirmed in another set of patients with viral response at 
 week 4; 57/63 (95% ci 83; 98%). this latter analysis should not be regarded as a subgroup analysis, 
 but as a proper confirmatory analysis.</p><p>
 the sponsor has now analysed data from a 24w versus 48w comparative introna/rebetol study. these 
 data provide some support for the notion that 24w of therapy is sufficient.</p><p>
 there is agreement that shortening the duration of therapy is of major benefit to the patient if not 
 associated with a too great loss in efficacy. as it is highly unlikely that 24 weeks of therapy is superior 
 to 48 weeks, the acceptable loss in activity has to be defined remembering that re-treatment (48w) is 
 possible in patients relapsing. there is no simple answer to this, but we find a recommendation to treat 
 for 48 weeks unacceptable as it means that at least 80% of the patients are treated for 24 weeks too 
 long with a far from well tolerated therapy.</p><p>view 2:</p><p>
 some chmp members expressed concern that such a change in the treatment duration could be associated with a higher, poorly estimated, risk of relapse as compared with the currently 
 recommended 48 weeks treatment duration.</p><p>
 the applicant was requested to provide further ensurance that the shortened treatment duration would 
 not expose patients to an increased risk of relapse. the applicant was encouraged to make a proposal 
 for an observational surveillance study with monitoring of the relapse rate as a post-marketing 
 commitment.</p><p>
 it was considered that observational non-comparative data could not provide sufficient evidence to 
 recommend a shortening of treatment duration and some chmp members were therefore of the 
 opinion that the question of the optimal treatment duration in patients with a virological response a 
 week 4 and week 24 warrants to compare a 24 week additional treatment course (versus no additional 
 treatment) in patients having responded at 4 and 24 weeks.</p></section><section><header>benefit risk assessment</header><p>following the chmp evaluation of the clinical data provided in support of the application, there were two main views within the committee:</p><p>
 view 1 - to shorten the treatment course mainly in view of the heaviness of the treatment and because it is considered that even if there is a higher risk of relapse, a relapse could be re-treated in case it 
 occurs (48 weeks). finally, there is no reason to treat the majority of patients with a regimen of 48 
 weeks of treatment whereas only a minority is expected to relapse.</p><p>
 view 2 - that it is not possible to replace the recommendation of 48 weeks of treatment by a recommendation of 24 weeks of treatment, because it has not been adequately demonstrated that both 
 treatment durations are equivalent:</p><p>
 - a higher, not precisely known, risk of relapse is associated with the shortening of the treatment 
 duration;</p><p>
 - there are uncertainties concerning clinical consequences of relapses (treatment duration for re-
 treatment of the relapses, response to re-treatment of relapsers after a short term treatment failed 
 treatment);</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised5/5 - it is debatable whether a major gain in the safety profile should be expected by a reduction of the treatment duration.</p><p>
 following discussions within the chmp, the committee agreed to accept the shortening of the 
 treatment duration. however, it was considered that the choice between the two possible durations 
 should be maintained for prescribers and patients.</p><p>
 as requested by the chmp, the mah agreed to perform (as a follow-up measure) an observational 
 surveillance study with monitoring of the relapse rate and to offer the opportunity to be re-treated for 
 48 weeks to the patients relapsing in the observational study. the mah will also provide the chmp 
 with periodic progress reports from the observational study together with any new information 
 available from the literature on hcv1 low viral load patients relapsing after a short-term treatment 
 duration of 24 weeks.</p><p>
 as a compromise between the different positions expressed, the following proposal for the product 
 information was agreed within the chmp and with the mah:</p></section><section><header>spc</header><p>section 4.2:</p><p>
 genotype 1: 
 -for patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another 
 nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).</p><p>
 -in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt;600, 000 iu/ml) who become 
 hcv rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv rna negative at week 24, the treatment 
 could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. 
 overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be 
 associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 section 5.1:</p><p>
 in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) 
 received pegintron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight 
 adjusted ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%. 
 forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and 
 week 24 of therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. 
 the high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis 
 (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).</p><p>
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).</p></section><section><header>package leaflet</header><p>the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one year, depending on your physician’s judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing 
 medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>conclusion</header><p>on 28 july 2005 the chmp considered this type ii variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet.</p><p>medicinal product no longer authorised</p></section></body></xml>
