 responders (see also</p><p>section</p></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1</header><p>). •</p></section><section><header>genotype 1</header><p>: for patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). 
 in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment 
 duration (see section 5.1). 
 •</p></section><section><header>genotypes 2 or 3</header><p>: it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. 
 •</p></section><section><header>genotype 4:</header><p> in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for 
 genotype 1.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>the recommended duration of dosing for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.</p><p>predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; 
 study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.</p><p>4</p></section><section><header>duration of treatment - retreatment predictability of sustained virological response</header><p>: all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have 
 demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 48 weeks of 
 therapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at week 12 are unlikely to become 
 sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients with severe renal impairment, including those on 
 hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal function decreases during treatment, pegintron

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in 
 some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are 
 generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have 
 occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>8</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>9haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-

 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose

 methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>14cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy,

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4). 
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products

 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available,

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the</p><p>16following combination regimens: • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>22for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from

 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks

 early virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for 
 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104;

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>31</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>32haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>33cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicinesmetabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>37cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy,

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm

 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease in cd4+ 
 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>38treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>39 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 44overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the

 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>45for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment 
 duration (see section 5.1).</p><p>•</p></section><section><header>genotypes 2 or 3</header><p>: it is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.

 sustained response in hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with 
 ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104;

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>54</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment.</p><p>patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>55haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>56cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>57childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and 
 injection site reaction. additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of subjects 
 included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability 
 and insomnia. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in 
 severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of 
 therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur 
 at a notably lower rate in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy compared to those treated with

 combination with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>60cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute 
 cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific 
 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>61treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>62 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 67overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>68for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>77</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>78haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>79cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>80childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>83cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>84treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>85 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 90overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>91for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

 combination therapy with ribavirin: also see ribavirin summary of the product characteristics (spc) if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use 
  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>100</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>101haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>102cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.. studies in animals 
 have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>103childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see 
 ribavirin spc).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of</p><p>the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and 
 injection site reaction. additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of subjects 
 included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability 
 and insomnia. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in 
 severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of 
 therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).</p><p>106cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease.</p><p> 
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), 
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infected patients</header><p>for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease in cd4+ 
 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell 
 counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products 
 that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>107treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>108 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 113overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior

 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>114for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>123</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>124haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>125cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>126childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia during 
 therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with cd4+ cell

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>130treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>131 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 136overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.</p><p>among 480</p><p>patients with &gt; 2 log viral 
 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>137for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced 
 by 50 %. data are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance

 combination therapy with ribavirin: also see ribavirin summary of the product characteristics (spc) if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use 
  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>146</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>147haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>148cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>149childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an

 mitochondrial toxicity: mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patients: although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm
 3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% 
 (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 cd4 lymphocytes decrease: treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute 
 cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).

 for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p><p>153</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the</p><p>154following combination regimens: • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 .</p><p> 159overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.</p><p>among 480</p><p>patients with &gt; 2 log viral 
 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %.</p><p>
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>160for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>169</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>170haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>171cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the 
 potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>177 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>183for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>192</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>193haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>194cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.
 . studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient 
 in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect.</p><p>
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 combination therapy with ribavirin:</p><p>ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female 
 patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of</p><p>195childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients and their female partners must each use an 
 effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see

 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic

 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>200 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens:

 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 %

 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron

 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>

 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been

 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>206for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

  psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even 
 after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including 
 aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and 
 alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely 
 monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential 
 seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the 
 need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or 
 worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.</p><p>
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this 
 should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic 
 management of the psychiatric condition.</p><p>
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.</p><p>
 all patients in the chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. 
 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a 
 reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical 
 therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p><p>215</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, 
 cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 thyroid changes and 4.8). 
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular 
 symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv co-infection</header><p>mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be 
 at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: 
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration. 
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.</p><p>216haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patients: hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may 
 be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 patients with low cd4 counts: 
 in patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in 
 subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.</p><p>
 please refer to the respective summary of product characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal 
 products that are to be taken concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of 
 toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and 
 ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>dental and periodontal disorders:</header><p> dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving pegintron and ribavirin</p><p>combination therapy. in addition, dry 
 mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term 
 treatment with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly 
 twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. 
 if this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>:</p><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing p450 substrates in chronic hepatitis c patients receiving once weekly pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of</p><p>217cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.</p><p> 
 caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by 
 cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and 
 phenytoin (cyp2c9) and flecainide (cyp2d6).</p><p>
 these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation 
 in patients undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore advised when pegintron 
 treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic 
 window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p><p> methadone: in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy 
 and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously 
 for 4 weeks increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 
 103 – 128 %). the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be 
 monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. 
 especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be 
 considered.</p><p>hcv/hiv co-infection nucleoside analogs: use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine 
 nucleosides 
 in vitro. this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not 
 recommended. reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of 
 which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.</p><p> there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.

 cd4 lymphocytes decrease:treatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell 
 percentage. the decrease in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of 
 therapy. the use of pegintron in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>222treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, peginterferon alfa-2b, atc code: l03a b10.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials – naïve patients</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p><p>223 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received

 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.</p></section><section><header>long-term efficacy data</header><p>a large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained</p><p>
 responders relapsed during the study. 
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>229for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into

 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was 
 a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either 
 active substance alone.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder for solution for injection:</p><p>

 cartridge (water for injections) for administration of up to 0.5 ml of solution. a small volume is lost 
 during preparation of pegintron for injection when the dose is measured and injected. therefore, each pen 
 contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure delivery of the labelled dose in 
 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection. the reconstituted solution has a concentration 
 of 150 micrograms in 0.5 ml.</p><p>pegintron is injected subcutaneously after reconstituting the powder as instructed, attaching an injection 
 needle and setting the prescribed dose. a complete and illustrated set of instructions is provided in the 
 annex to the package leaflet.</p><p>
 remove pegintron pre-filled pen from the refrigerator before administration to allow the solvent to reach</p><p>231room temperature (not more than 25°c).</p><p>
 as for all parenteral medicinal products, inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration. 
 the reconstituted solution should be clear and colourless. do not use if discolouration or particulate 
 matter is present. after administering the dose, discard the pegintron pre- filled pen and any unused 
 solution contained in it.</p></section><section><header n="7">7. marketing authorisation holder</header><p>sp europe 73, rue de stalle

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>269</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>270it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of

 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first-time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>271in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>272blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose

 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes,

 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>273necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>277slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>278</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 80 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>280it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>281in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor has told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, 
 and take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if

 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>282blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>

 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>283necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>287slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the

  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>289</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron.

 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>290it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>291in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>292blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose

 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>293necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>297slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>298</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 120 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of

 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>300it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>301in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>302blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising,

 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speakingand swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>303necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>307slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>308</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user  pegintron 150 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection</header><p>peginterferon alfa-2b (conjugation of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol)</p></section><section><header>read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron
  is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>309</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines:</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>310it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>311in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give 
 yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>312blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>313necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p>317slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>318</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the user

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>319</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>320it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>321in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>322blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes,

 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>323necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the 
 pegintron which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p> 327</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button

      figure 4</header><p>• take the pen from the tray holder.</p><p>• holding the pen firmly, pull the dosing button out as far as it will go, until you see a</p></section><section><header>dark ring</header><p> on the pen. the dosing button should be easy to pull out without too much force 
 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
   figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper 
 dark ring</p><p>329</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your 
 dose, it is extra. 
 • once the injection site is dry, pull off the</p></section><section><header>yellow inner needle cap</header><p> carefully exposing the injection needle. you are now ready to inject.</p><p>outer needle 
 cap 
 yellow 
 inner 
 needle cap</p><p>330</p><p>• remove the needle from your skin. • gently press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for a few seconds. 
 • do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. • discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with the needle safely in a closed rigid container.</p></section><section><header>after 2 hours, check the injection site for redness, swelling, or tenderness. if you have a skin reaction and it doesn’t clear up in a few days, contact your health care 
 professional.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>

 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>332</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.

 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron.

 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your

 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>333it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products.

 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>335blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose

 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>336necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the 
 pegintron which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p> 340•</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
   figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper

 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>345</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>346it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>347in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>348blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose

 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>349necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 additionally, vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the 
 eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with pegintron use.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the 
 pegintron which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p> 353•</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
   figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper 
 dark ring</p><p>355</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your 
 dose, it is extra. 
 • once the injection site is dry, pull off the</p></section><section><header>yellow inner needle cap</header><p> carefully exposing the injection needle. you are now ready to inject.</p><p>outer needle

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon. 
 -</p><p>if you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled 
 during the past 6 months. 
 -</p><p>if you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak. 
 -</p><p>if you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are 
 taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against 
 infection and some diseases). 
 -</p><p>if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. 
 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>358</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. 
 -</p><p>if you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination. 
 -</p><p>if you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood. 
 -</p><p>if you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use 
 pegintron. 
 -</p><p>if you are also being treated for hiv, please see</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>. -</p><p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>359it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>360in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>361blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>362necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the 
 pegintron which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p> 366•</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab. 
 • take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective</p></section><section><header>paper tab</header><p>, but</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle. 
 •</p></section><section><header>keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, firmly</header><p> push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane 
 (figure 2) and</p></section><section><header>screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction</header><p>.</p></section><section><header>figure 1</header><p>dosing button

 being needed (figure 4).</p></section><section><header>note: do not push the dosing button back in at this time. you will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron. 
   figure 3</header><p>• check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.</p></section><section><header>if they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).</header><p>stopper stopper 
 dark ring</p><p>368</p></section><section><header>step 4: inject the pegintron solution</header><p>• select the injection site. your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen). the best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and 
 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much 
 force being needed (figure 5). if you have trouble dialing your 
 dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out</p></section><section><header>as far</header><p> as it will go.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p>:</p></section><section><header>if you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen 
 because it may not deliver the correct dose.</header><p>• carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. do not remove either of the needle caps and do not push 
 the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the 
 pegintron dose.</p></section><section><header>figure 6</header><p>• pull off the</p></section><section><header>outer needle cap (figure 6)</header><p>. • there may be some liquid around the inner needle cap. don’t worry, this is normal. this liquid is not part of your 
 dose, it is extra. 
 • once the injection site is dry, pull off the</p></section><section><header>yellow inner needle cap</header><p> carefully exposing the injection needle. you are now ready to inject.</p><p>outer needle

 • do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. • discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with the needle safely in a closed rigid container.</p></section><section><header>after 2 hours, check the injection site for redness, swelling, or tenderness. if you have a skin reaction and it doesn’t clear up in a few days, contact your health care 
 professional.

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>interferons modify the response of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases. pegintron, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection 
 of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable hiv.</p><p>
 pegintron is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in 
 first-time users. this combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not 
 responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy 
 or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 pegintron is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use pegintron</header><p>pegintron is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.</p></section><section><header>do not use pegintron</header><p>- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of

 -</p><p>if you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).</p><p>371</p></section><section><header>take special care with pegintron</header><p>- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or 
 hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. 
 -</p><p>if you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder. 
 -</p><p>if you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your 
 kidney blood values regularly during treatment. if you have a kidney disease and you are using 
 pegintron in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should 
 monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count. 
 -</p><p>if you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis c). 
 -</p><p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, 
 or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.

 -</p><p>if you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
 sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with pegintron (see section 4). 
 -</p><p>if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase 
 the risk of rejection. be sure to discuss this with your doctor.</p><p>
 dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
 pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
 teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of pegintron with 
 ribavirin. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in 
 addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth 
 thoroughly afterwards.</p></section><section><header>while being treated with pegintron</header><p>your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect on human pregnancy is not known. in 
 combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both 
 female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance 
 for pregnancy to occur: 
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. you and your 
 partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 
 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with your doctor.</p><p>
 - if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. if your female 
 partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month 
 during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. this can be discussed with your 
 doctor. if you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during 
 the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this can be discussed with 
 your doctor.</p><p>372it is not known whether this product is present in human milk. therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking pegintron. in combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective 
 informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking pegintron.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron</header><p>this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;. 
 this medicinal product contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
 intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header>patients who also have hiv infection</header><p>lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), an hiv treatment. if you are receiving haart, the addition of 
 pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. your doctor will 
 monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. (please be sure to read the ribavirin patient 
 leaflet also). additionally, patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and 
 zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). if you 
 are also being treated for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection (aids) with zidovudine or 
 stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your 
 blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, 
 your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. 
 co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of 
 lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use pegintron</header><p>your doctor has prescribed pegintron specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.</p><p>
 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 86 and 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 of 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 105 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening (total of 
 1,400 mg each day).</p><p>
 in first time users, the combination treatment is continued for 3 to 6 months, and sometimes for one 
 year</p><p>depending on your physicians judgement. take notice of the respective informing texts of 
 ribavirin containing medicinal products. 
 for</p><p>hcv</p></section><section><header>/</header><p>hiv co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.</p><p>373in patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year. if you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, 
 depending upon your kidney function. 
 pegintron alone was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is

 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
 pharmacist.</p><p>
 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if there is discolouration of the reconstituted 
 solution or if particulate matter is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you 
 give yourself the injection, discard the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 always use pegintron exactly as your doctor told you. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and 
 take it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. contact your doctor or pharmacist if 
 needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 some people get depressed when taking pegintron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, 
 and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice 
 that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want 
 to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or 
 changes in your behaviour.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, 
 wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); 
 trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;</p><p>374blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes 
 severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or 
 mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your 
 white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets 
 (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 other side effects that may occur with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules include:</p><p>
 very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):</p><p>irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose 
 stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, 
 trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood 
 swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, 
 rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): increased sweating, chest pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), 
 stomach upset, rapid heart rate, agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorder, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, changed 
 behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), feeling sleepy, cold sores, 
 fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, increased need to pass urine, ear or 
 respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair texture, sensitivity to sunlight, 
 migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy hands or feet, enlarged liver, 
 problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking and swollen glands.</p><p>
 the following rare and very rare events have been reported with pegintron:</p><p>
 rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): 
 diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.</p><p>
 very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very 
 rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke 
 (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of 
 these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia. pure red 
 cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been 
 reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack 
 of energy.</p><p>
 additionally, the following events have been reported with pegintron: facial palsy (weakness and 
 slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin 
 disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous 
 layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal</p><p>375necrolysis/stevens johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other 
 mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable 
 enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and 
 excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining 
 of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p>
 if you are receiving haart, the addition of pegintron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic 
 acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells 
 which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called 
 platelets).</p><p>
 the following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of pegintron 
 and ribavirin capsules (adults) in hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving haart: oral candidiasis 
 (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, cd4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, 
 hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.</p><p>
 if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
 tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use pegintron pre-filled pen.</p></section><section><header>please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.</header><p>your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the pegintron pre-filled pen. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared. use the injection 
 needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack</p></section><section><header>only</header><p>for the pegintron pre-filled pen. make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it. your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take 
 for your treatment.</p></section><section><header>note: the colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the pegintron pre-filled pen.  preparation:</header><p>a. find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will 
 need for the injection. all of the supplies you will need are in the pegintron pack. the pack 
 contains: 
 •</p><p>pegintron pre-filled pen •</p><p>one disposable injection needle •</p><p>two cleansing swabs, and •</p><p>dosing tray b. 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to 
 come to room temperature before you use it. before taking the pegintron pre-filled pen out of its 
 carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton. do not use if the expiration date has 
 passed. 
 c 
 take the pegintron pre-filled pen out of the carton. look in the window of the pen and make 
 sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. this is the 
 pegintron which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. 
 d. 
 wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. it is important to keep 
 your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.</p></section><section><header>please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.  step 1: mix the medicine 
 key points: 
 before you mix the pegintron, make sure it is at room temperature. it is important that you 
 keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright (dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).</header><p> 379•</p></section><section><header>step 2: attach the needle</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen</p></section><section><header>upright (dosing button down)</header><p>and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. 
 • screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.</p></section><section><header>note</header><p> : you may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen. this is normal. 
 • wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • the dark stoppers</p></section><section><header>move up</header><p> and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3). 
 •</p></section><section><header>place the pegintron pre-filled pen</header><p>upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on 
 the</p></section><section><header>bottom</header><p>) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface. you may want to hold the pen using the grip. 
 • to mix the powder and the liquid, keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright in the dosing tray and</p></section><section><header>press the top half</header><p>of the pen</p></section><section><header>downward</header><p> toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface</p></section><section><header>until you hear the pen click.</header><p>once you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that both dark stoppers are now touching. the dosing button should be 
 flush with the pen body.</p><p>• wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. •</p></section><section><header>gently turn the pen upside down twice. do not shake the pen.</header><p>• keep the pegintron pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down. then, look through the pen window to see 
 that the mixed pegintron solution is competely dissolved. if 
 there is still foam, wait until it settles.</p><p>
 • the solution should be clear and colourless before use.</p></section><section><header>do not use</header><p>the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles
 . • before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the 
 solution. 
 • place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.</p></section><section><header>figure 2</header><p>• keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the pegintron pre-filled pen with one cleansing 
 swab.

 muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen. do not inject yourself in 
 the area near your navel or waistline. if you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>you should use a different site each time you inject pegintron to avoid soreness at any one site.</header><p> do not inject pegintron into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.</p><p>• clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.</p></section><section><header>figure 5</header><p>• turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab. the button should turn easily without too much
