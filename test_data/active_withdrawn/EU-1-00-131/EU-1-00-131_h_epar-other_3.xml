 ribonucleic acid (hcv-rna) or anti-hcv, including naïve patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection in combination with ribavirin. this combination is also indicated in patients who have failed 
 previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination 
 therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>the approved dose of peginterferon alfa-2b (peg2b) is 1.5 
 μg/kg. to date the efficacy of the 1.0 
 μg/kg dose and the 1.5 μg/kg dose in combination with ribavirin has not been compared. the study “ideal” (p03471) was therefore designed, in accordance with a post-approval commitment to the 
 fda, to compare the safety and efficacy of the two peg2b dosing regimens. ideal also included the 
 use of an active comparator, peginterferon alfa-2a (peg2a) 180 µg/week plus weight-based ribavirin 
 to allow for the evaluation of comparative safety and efficacy of the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin 
 (peg2b/r) and peg2a/r treatment regimens.</p><p>
 the ideal study (p03471) supports a therapeutic extension of indication to include treatment of 
 patients with compensated cirrhosis. on the basis of the ideal study results the mah proposes to 
 maintain the approved dose of peginterferon alfa-2b (peg2b) as 1.5 
 μg/kg. a change in the scheme for dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b in case of adverse effects and a change in the weight-based 
 dosing algorithm for rebetol are also proposed. the mah also proposed an increase in the dose of 
 rebetol in the 81-85 kg weight category across all genotypes.</p></section><section><header>i.2 scientific overview and discussion  
  study design</header><p>ideal was a randomised, parallel-group multicentre trial conducted in the usa, in treatment-naive genotype 1 patients with chronic hepatitis c. patients were randomised to three different treatment 
 arms: 
 • peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μg g/kg/week plus ribavirin (peg2b 1.5/r).</p><p>• peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 μg/kg/week plus</p><p>ribavirin (peg2b 1.0/r) • peginterferon alfa-2a 180 μg/week plus ribavirin (peg2a/r).</p><p>
 in all arms, the pegylated interferon was combined with weight-based ribavirin. the dosing algorithm 
 for ribavirin, however, was different between arms, reflecting the different posologies for ribavirin co-
 treatment in the pegintron and pegasys spcs: 
 • in the peg2b arms, ribavirin was dosed at 800 mg/day when body weight (bw) was 40-65kg, 1000 mg/day if bw &gt;65-85, 1200 mg/day if bw &gt;85-105 and 1400 mg/day if bw &gt;105kg. 
 • in the peg2a arm, patients with bw &lt; 75 kg received 1000 mg/day and those with bw &gt;75 kg received 1200 mg.</p><p>the predefined algorithms for ribavirin dose modification in case of anaemia differed between arms: 
 • in the peg2b arm, the ribavirin dose was to be decreased stepwise by 200 mg (400 mg if initial dose 1400 mg), and again by 200 mg if necessary.</p><p>
 • in the peg2a arm, the dose was to be decreased to 600 mg regardless of initial dose.</p><p> 
 3/15 medicinal product no longer authorisedtreatment duration was planned to 48 weeks, and stopping rules were applied in case of detectable hcv-rna at 24 weeks, or detectable and less than &gt;2 log10 decline of hcv-rna at week 12.</p><p>
 the comparison between peg2b doses was double-blinded, whereas the assignment to peg2a or 
 peg2b was open-label. 
 endpoints 
 • the primary endpoint variable was svr (sustained virological response = undetectable hcv-rna 24 weeks post treatment completion). 
 • comparison of proportions with svr of arm 1 vs arm 2, and arm 1 vs arm 3 were defined as co-primary endpoints.</p><p>
 • patients were stratified as to race (black vs non-black) and baseline hcv-rna (≤600 000 vs &gt;600 000 iu/ml). differential response in these strata were predefined secondary endpoints.</p><p>power considerations the comparison between the two peg2b was designed to have an 80% power to detect a 6.5% difference in response rate, given a one-sided test, on the assumption of a greater efficacy of the higher 
 dose, for an alpha of 0.025. the comparison between peg2b1.5/r and peg2a/r had 80% power to 
 detect a 7% difference in response rate, at a two-sided alpha of 0.025.</p></section><section><header>results</header><p>patient disposition</p><p>a total of 3070 subjects (1019 in the peg2b 1.5/r arm, 1016 in the peg2b 1.0/r arm, and 1035 in the peg2a/r arm) were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug.</p><p>baseline characteristics the study population consisted of mostly male (60%), caucasian subjects, over 40 years old, with 82% having a high viral load (&gt;600,000 iu/ml).</p><p>most subjects had metavir f0/1/2 scores, and 
 11% of each arm had bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis.</p></section><section><header>i.3 clinical efficacy</header><p>primary endpoint the study demonstrated that each of the three treatment regimens results in similar svr rates</p><p>(table 1) that did not differ significantly. the response rates for the peg2b 1.5/r and the 
 peg2b 1.0/r arms were 39.8 and 38%, respectively. the point estimate for the difference was 1.8 
 with a 95% ci of -2.3 - +6.0.</p><p>

 the peg2b 1.5/r arm showed a higher proportion of svr among black patients, compared with the peg2b 1.0/r arm (23 vs 16.6%). this difference was discernable regardless of baseline hcv-rna.</p><p>
 in the subgroup with high baseline viral load (&gt; 600 000 iu/ml), the probability of svr was roughly 
 similar (35.3 vs 33.4%; difference 1.9%; 95% ci -3.1 - +6%). among non-black patients, the 
 probability of svr in patients with high baseline viral load was similar between arms (38.8 vs 38.6%).</p><p>

 as shown in previous studies with interferon and ribavirin, early negativity is an important predictor 
 for achieving a svr. subjects who achieve hcv negativity by tw 4 (rapid virologic response) have a 
 high probability of being sustained responders (high ppv). as shown in table 5, subjects with an 
 undetectable hcv-rna level at tw 4 who were treated with peg2b 1.5 μg/kg/wk (92.2%) had the 
 highest response, followed by subjects treated with peg2b 1.0 μg/kg/wk (87.3%) or peg2a (79.7%). 
 consistent with the higher relapse rate observed with peg2a/r, the ppv was lower in the peg2a/r 
 arm than in the peg2b/r arms.</p><p>
 among those subjects who had detectable hcv-rna at tw 12 and met the criteria of ≥2-log

 dose as compared to the 1.0 
 μg/kg would translate into a higher rate of the clinically relevant svr for the 1.5 µg/kg compared to 1.0 µg/kg, when combined with ribavirin. the ideal study did not deliver 
 evidence in support of this hypothesis. the overall svr rates for peg2b 1.5 and 1.0 
 μg/kg/week were similar (40% and 38%, respectively).</p><p>
 regarding the extension to include patients with compensated cirrhosis, 11 % of patients in the 
 ideal study had bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis, approximately 35 % had a normal baseline alt. it 
 should be noted that the ideal study was not designed to evaluate treatment of subjects with normal 
 alt level. however the results according to baseline alt appeared to be comparable between the 
 three treatment arms with somewhat higher svr rates for patients with elevated alt at baseline. 
 therefore the extension of indication is considered approvable.</p><p>overall the addition of patients with 
 cirrhosis is sufficiently substantiated by the ideal study.</p><p>
 subgroups of patients with hcv known to have a lower likelihood of successful treatment outcome 
 include those with genotype 1, high baseline hcv-rna, black race and/or cirrhosis. in patients with 
 baseline hcv-rna &gt;600 000 there was however</p><p>no significant difference in the svr rate between 
 doses in the ideal study, and point estimates are roughly similar (35.3 vs 33.4%; difference 1.9%; 
 95% ci -3.1 - +6%). this equivalence of effect is supported by data from the dose-ranging 
 monotherapy study [1], where the svr rates for peg2b 1.5 and peg2b 1.0 were similar regardless of 
 baseline hcv-rna.</p><p>
 in black patients there was a non-significant trend towards a higher svr rate in patients treated with 
 peg2b 1.5/r compared to peg2b 1.0/r (23.0 vs 16.6%). these results imply that the exposure-
 response relation of peginterferons may be different in this population. the fact that similar rates of 
 dose modifications and discontinuations due to neutropenia are seen regardless of race, despite lower 
 baseline neutrophil counts in black, may corroborate this implication.</p><p>
 a number of studies have established that african-americans (aa) are less responsive to interferon 
 therapy than caucasians and that higher initial doses of interferon in difficult to treat patients have 
 limited effect in increasing svr. this suggests that increasing interferon doses for african-americans 
 will have led to only a small improvement in svr, especially in contrast to using a protease inhibitor 
 8/15 medicinal product no longer authorisedas a third therapeutic agent. as such no change in the posology for black patients has been recommended.</p><p>
 importantly, in patients with cirrhosis (metavir f4; n = 61 and 70), there was a striking and 
 statistically significant difference in svr rates, to the advantage of the lower peg2b 1.0/r arm on the 
 peg2b 1.5/r arm (30.0 vs. 9.8%; difference 20.2%, 95% ci 7-33%). in the broader category of 
 patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis (f3/f4; n = 111 and 107), point estimates were also clearly, and 
 almost statistically significantly, in favour of the lower dose (29.9 vs. 20.7%; difference 9.2%; 95% ci 
 20.7 - -2.3).</p><p>
 the chmp considered whether a lower starting dose could be considered for cirrhotic patients who 
 may have lower haematological reserve and could potentially tolerate higher total regimen when 
 receiving a lower peg2b dose. however the chmp agreed that the ideal study is not robust enough 
 to demonstrate this taking into account that the conclusion are based on a subgroup analysis from a 
 failing global analysis and this subgroup represents around 7% of the whole population of the study.</p><p>
 there are also critical imbalances in favour of the peg2b lower dose, including factors potentially 
 influencing the treatment response (i.e. vl&gt;600k, black). an unexpected sharp decrease in the 
 response rate between f3 and f4 was also noted in the peg2b 1.5/r (from 34% to 9.8%). furthermore 
 the difference between both treatment arms in favour of the peg2b 1.0 µg/kg dose is already observed 
 at week 2 suggests a sampling bias more than a true difference due to a differential tolerance. finally 
 the higher rate of epo in the peg2b 1.0 µg/kg allowing a higher dose ribavirin might in part explain 
 the better response rate in the peg2b 1.0 µg/kg arm.</p><p>
 as such the chmp agreed that the higher dose (1. 5 µg/kg) should be used for patients with cirrhosis.</p><p>
 taking into account the higher response rates with higher doses of ribavirin per body weight the 
 chmp accepted the proposed change in ribavirin dose from 1000 mg to 1200 mg (or 14-15 mg/kg) in 
 patients with a body weight of 81-85 kg and genotype 1. there were concerns that the higher ribavirin 
 dose might have an impact on adherence and thus svr rates. however data provided by the mah did 
 not show a falling adherence rate within the range of mg/kg in question for the proposed change in 
 posology.</p><p>
 the mah also proposed an increased ribavirin dose from 1000 to 1200 mg in genotype 2 and 3 
 patients in the 81-85 kg stratum, although ideal exclusively studied patients with genotype 1. the 
 chmp had concerns that putative gain in efficacy with the increased dose is at best marginal in these 
 genotypes, and would mainly cause an increased rate of anaemia. taking this into account the chmp 
 considered that the posology for ribavirin when treating with peginterferon alfa-2b might be 
 harmonised with the flat dosing of ribavirin that is used when co-treating with peginterferon alfa-2a.</p><p> 
 the only randomised comparison between a flat dose of 800 mg and a weight based regimen</p><p>
 (800-1400 mg/day) for peg2b 1.5 
 μg/kg is the win-r [2] study, in which there was no genotype restriction. in a subgroup of 1500 patients with genotype 2/3, point estimates for svr in the weight-
 based and flat dose arms were 61.8% and 59.5% respectively, a non significant difference. of note, the 
 win-r study had a rather high rate of missing data, as reflected by the relatively low point estimates.</p><p>
 the 800 mg flat dose posology for ribavirin in genotype 2/3 is mainly based on a phase iii clinical 
 trial published by hadziyannis et al [3]. in this study, including over 1000 patients of whom 
 approximately 500 patients had genotype 2/3, an 800 mg flat dose of ribavirin was compared to a 
 higher, weight-based ribavirin dose regimen (1000/1200 mg below/above 75 kg), both in combination 
 with peg2a. the study, which had a factorial design, also compared 24 versus 48 weeks of therapy. 
 there was no evidence of an increased efficacy in patients with genotype 2/3 given the higher, 
 weight-based dose, point estimates for svr rates being very similar at around 80%. data from this 
 study also show a higher rate of serious adverse events and anaemia with the higher, weight-based 
 dose.</p><p>
 9/15 medicinal product no longer authorisedoverall the available randomised evidence with peg2a or peg2b fail to support any clinically significant efficacy advantage of a higher dose of ribavirin. available observational evidence 
 including suboptimal interferon regimens such as introna or peginterferon alfa-2b</p><p>dosed at 0.5 µg/kg 
 imply that there may be a lower response rate in very heavy individuals (&gt;110 kg), where effects of 
 dose and baseline factors could hardly confidently be separated by multiple regression approaches. 
 importantly the ribavirin exposure response relationship when co-treating with standard interferon is 
 not relevant to the question at hand. with regards to safety, the two studies comparing flat dose and 
 weight based ribavirin treatment have, as is expected, shown a greater degree of anemia in patients 
 treated with the higher dosed weight based ribavirin algorithms. taking into account the lack of 
 supportive evidence for weight based ribavirin dosing the chmp requested the mah to provide a 
 rational for the differing dosing recommendations between the different peginterferons.</p><p>
 the mah provided a putative rational as to why data from studies with peg2a in genotype 2/3 might 
 not be applicable to peg2b. importantly the size and position of the peg molecule used for peg2b 
 and peg2a differ significantly in their respective physical-chemical characteristics. of note it also 
 results in loss of 
 in vitro biological activity. the antiviral activity of peg2b is approximately 28% of the interferon alfa-2b core protein while the antiviral activity of peg2a ranges between 1% to 7% of 
 the antiviral activity of the interferon alfa-2a core protein. it has also been demonstrated that the size 
 and position of the peg moiety on the interferon alpha molecule markedly affects its specific activity, 
 presumably by stearic hindrance imposed upon the peptide by the addition of a larger peg molecule. 
 silva et al 
 [4] compared pharmacokinetics and assessed mrna expression of selected interferon-induced rna gene transcripts for the two pegylated interferons (peg2b and peg2a).</p><p>in this trial 
 (compare), 26 genotype 1 patients received peg2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) or peg2a (180 µg/week) 
 monotherapy for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks with the addition of ribavirin (~13 mg/kg/day).</p><p>
 overall there is a much greater protein exposure with the larger peg2a at the recommended dose 
 which, in part, reflects the lower specific activity of the molecule thus requiring more product to 
 achieve optimal antiviral activity. despite the greater exposure with peg2a, there was consistently 
 greater up-regulation of rna transcripts in patients treated with peg2b compared with patients 
 treated with peg2a for the majority of the interferon-response genes investigated. similarly, with a 
 greater up-regulation in interferon response genes, peg2b demonstrated significantly greater antiviral 
 activity vs. peg2a at week one, with greater maximum antiviral activity (p&lt;0.001) and greater 
 cumulative antiviral activity (p=0.017); the slope of the viral load reduction for peg2b was greater 
 over the eight-week study duration (p&lt;0.002).</p><p>in addition, 72% percent of patients in the peg2b arm 
 achieved at least a 2.0 log10 reduction in viral load as compared to 44% of patients in the peg2a arm 
 during the study (p=0.09).</p><p>the mean maximum and time-weighted decreases in log10 viral load were 
 significantly greater with peg2b than peg2a on week 1 and week 4. these results show that the 
 viral kinetics are very different for both of these interferons with apparent periods of viral replication 
 with peg2b vs. peg2a. this may also affect the mechanism by which the pegylated interferons 
 interact with ribavirin.</p><p>thus, the two molecules, while each exerting interferon antiviral activity, do 
 so in a very different manner, and it cannot be assumed that the ribavirin interaction at a given dose 
 will be the same.</p><p>
 the chmp considered that it is questionable whether these differences in pk/pd really imply that the 
 need of ribavirin dosing is actually higher for peg2b in genotype 2/3, given that the total viral load 
 decline over time in this cited study was greater with peg2b than with peg2a and that ribavirin has 
 virtually no direct effect on hcv viral load 
 [5]. overall however the chmp acknowledged that the mah has provided an argument that data generated with peg2a might not be applicable to peg2b, 
 due to the clear differences in the pk/pd relation between these two drugs. as such the chmp agreed 
 to maintain weight base dosing for ribavirin in combination with peg2b and therefore to the dose 
 increase of ribavirin in genotype 2 and 3 patients weighing 81-85 kg.</p><p>
 regarding the predictive value of response at treatment week 4 and 12 and their usefulness in clinical 
 practice for the management of hcv-infected patients, this has been increasingly highlighted in the 
 recent years. some data suggest that rapid and early virological response to treatment (at treatment 
 week 4 (tw4) and 12 (tw12)) rather than genotype might be better factor to guide optimal treatment 
 duration (24 weeks, 48 weeks or longer treatment duration). in the ideal study a null response 
 10/15 medicinal product no longer authorised(defined as less than 1 log decline in hcv rna from baseline) at tw4 was found to be a strong predictor of lack of response and is a relevant early stopping rule. furthermore among those subjects 
 who had detectable hcv-rna at tw12 and met the criteria of ≥2-log decrease, reassessment at tw 
 24 allowed for good predictability in the two peg2b groups (44.6%/48.7%).</p><p>rebetol and pegintron

 the incidence of treatment-related, treatment-emergent depression was 6% higher in the peg2b 1.5

 if wbc count falls below 1.5*10
 9/l, if neutrophils falls below 0.75*109/l or if the platelet count falls below 50*10
 9/l (and that pegintron be discontinued if these levels fall below 1*109/l, 0.5*109/l and 25*10
 9/l, respectively). a large proportion of patients randomised to 1.5 μg/kg, who had a one step dose reduction, did not require a second dose reduction, maintaining a high exposure. this dose 
 reduction schedule appears justified as the 1.5 
 μg/kg starting dose has been endorsed. however, the dose reduction scheme did not prevent a significantly higher number of discontinuations in patients 
 randomised to the higher dose: 12.7% of subjects discontinued treatment in the peg2b 1.5/r arm, 
 compared to 9.6% in the peg2b 1.0/r arm, and 13.0% in the peg2a/r arm. the difference in 
 discontinuation rates between peg2b 1.5/r and peg2b 1.0/r was 3%; 95% ci 0.2-5.7%.</p></section><section><header>table 8: summary of dose modification steps due to adverse events</header><p>the mah also proposed a change to the algorithm for dose adjustment of rebetol in case of anaemia to be modified in accordance with that used in the peg2b 1.5/r and peg2b 1.0/r arms of the ideal 
 study. in the peg2b arm, the ribavirin dose was decreased stepwise by 200 mg (400 mg if initial dose 
 1400 mg), and again 200 mg if necessary. this strategy was also used in the win-r study 
 [2]. the dose modification algorithm has been extensively evaluated, and is in line with available evidence that 
 maintaining a high ribavirin exposure is important for the optimisation of the likelihood of svr. 
 12/15 medicinal product no longer authorised</p></section><section><header>discussion clinical safety</header><p>the safety profile of peg2b and peg2a when used in combination with ribavirin in this study is consistent with that in the respective current product information; no new or unexpected aes were 
 observed. the study drug discontinuation rate was higher in the peg2b 1.5 
 μg/kg arm than in the peg2b 1.0 
 μg/kg arm (12.7 vs. 9.6%). the frequency of sae was similar: 8.6% vs 9.3%. there was however a higher rate of anemia and neutropenia in the 1.5 
 μg/kg arm as compared to the 1.0 µg/kg arm which is as expected.</p><p>
 the proportion of patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, as defined by the center for 
 epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) data, was compared for the two pegintron doses 
 (32% in the peg2b 1.5 arm and 29.4% in the peg2b 1.0 arm). from a clinical perspective the 
 difference of 2.6% is not meaningful, although due to the large sample size of the study the difference 
 is statistically significant. study sites were notified in case of critical values of ces-d assessment and 
 patients were to be assessed and managed clinically according to a pre specified plan at site.</p><p>
 the ces-d evaluation was included in the ideal study to determine if a patient self-administered 
 assessment could provide, in addition to physician assessment, an indicator of development of 
 psychiatric adverse events. the ces-d scores during the study did not predict the most severe 
 psychiatric outcomes and cannot therefore supersede a physician’s clinical assessment. in an attempt 
 to determine the physician utility of the ces-d and the potential to use baseline ces-d scores to 
 predict the likelihood of a particular patient developing a psychiatric adverse event(s), further analyses 
 are being performed by the mah.</p><p>
 the new dose-reduction schedule for pegintron of 1.5
 →1.0→0.5 μg/kg, and the stepwise dose reduction of 200 mg (400 mg if initial dose 1400 mg), and again 200 mg of ribavirin if necessary in 
 case of adverse events is accepted. this dose reduction schedule of pegintron appears justified also 
 taking into account that</p><p>the 1.5

 caucasians the higher dose is likely to be more efficacious. therefore 1.5 
 μg/kg remains the recommended dose in the overall population.</p><p>regarding the extension to include patients with compensated cirrhosis, 11 % of patients in the 
 ideal study had bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis, approximately 35 % had a normal baseline alt. it 
 should be noted that the ideal study was not designed to evaluate treatment of subjects with normal 
 alt level. however the results according to baseline alt appeared to be comparable between the 
 three treatment arms with somewhat higher svr rates for patients with elevated alt at baseline. 
 therefore the extension of indication is considered approvable. overall the addition of patients with 
 compensated cirrhosis is sufficiently substantiated by the ideal study.</p><p>
 the chmp considered whether a lower starting dose could be recommended for cirrhotic patients who 
 may have lower haematological reserve and could potentially tolerate higher total regimen when 
 13/15 medicinal product no longer authorisedreceiving a lower peg2b dose. however the chmp agreed that the study is not robust enough to demonstrate this and thus agreed to maintain the 1.5 
 μg/kg posology in this subgroup.</p><p> 
 in black patients there was a non-significant trend towards a higher svr rate in patients treated with 
 peg2b 1.5/r compared to peg2b 1.0/r. a number of studies have established that african-
 americans (aa) are less responsive to interferon therapy than caucasians and that higher initial doses 
 of interferon in difficult to treat patients have limited effect in increasing svr. this suggests that 
 increasing interferon doses for african-americans will have led to only a small improvement in svr, 
 especially in contrast to using a protease inhibitor as a third therapeutic agent. as such no change in 
 the posology for black patients has been made.</p><p>
 concerning the weight based dosing of rebetol, pk/pd data give a putative pharmacologic rationale 
 for why data from studies with peg2a in genotype 2/3 might not be applicable to peg2b. 
 discounting the hadziyannis study, the evidence base for a flat dose is considerably weakened. there 
 is clearly more experience with weight based regimens when co-treating with peg2b, though the 
 relative merit of this remains undecided. the generalisation of the suggested dose increase is not 
 mandated by data, but there are no prohibitive safety concerns. from a practical point of view, two 
 very similar posologies for genotype 1 and 2/3 should be avoided. finally, the putative benefit of 
 harmonised ribavirin dosing between peginterferons in genotype 2/3 would depend on this being 
 implemented also outside eu. as this presently does not appear feasible, the main argument for 
 pursuing harmonised dosing falls. therefore, the generalisation of the dose increase to all genotypes is 
 recommended.</p><p>
 overall the risk benefit balance of peginterferon alfa-2b is considered positive taking into account the 
 changes implemented to reflect the results of the ideal study.
