 which have been finalised before 7 may 2002. for scientific information on procedures after this 
 date please refer to module 8b.  
 1.
 introduction</header><p>the active substance is a polyethylene glycol-modified (&quot;pegylated&quot;) derivative of introna (human recombinant interferon alfa-2b). the modification was developed in order to decrease the systemic 
 clearance of the active moiety. in addition, an improved benefit risk relationship was aimed for, based 
 on the hypothesis that cmax governs side effects, while efficacy may relate better to auc. this is the 
 first peg-conjugate of a therapeutic protein for which an assessment in the centralised procedure is 
 made. 
 therapeutic indication</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>pegintron was initially indicated in monotherapy in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with histologically proven chronic 
 hepatitis c who have serum markers for virus c replication, e.g. those who have elevated 
 transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv. 
 the indication was extended following the first authorisation of pegintron further to the availability of 
 preclinical and clinical data on the use of peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin. 
 the indication currently approved is therefore the following: 
 pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis c 
 who has elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-
 rna or anti-hcv.</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. 
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded 
 (with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have 
 subsequently relapsed. 
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin. 
 proposed posology</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c. 
 pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administered 
 depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy. 
 combination therapy 
 pegintron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules. 
 the dose of ribavirin to be used in combination with pegintron is based on patient body weight 
 (</p></section><section><header>table 1</header><p>). ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

 duration of treatment: based on the results of clinical trials, it is recommended that patients be treated for at least six months. during those clinical trials in which patients were treated for one year, patients 
 who failed to show a virologic response after six months of treatment (hcv-rna below lower limit 
 of detection) were unlikely to become sustained virologic responders (hcv-rna below lower limit of 
 detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). 
 •</p></section><section><header>genotype 1</header><p>: treatment should be continued for another six month period (i.e., a total of one year) in patients who exhibit negative hcv-rna after six months of treatment.</p><p>
 •</p></section><section><header>genotypes non-1</header><p>: the decision to extend therapy to one year in patients with negative hcv-rna after six months of treatment should be based on other prognostic factors (e.g., age 
 &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).</p><p>
 pegintron monotherapy</p><p>
 as monotherapy the pegintron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg/week.</p><p>
 duration of treatment:</p><p>it is recommended that patients be treated initially for six months. in patients 
 showing loss of hcv-rna at six months, treatment is to be continued for an additional six months, 
 i.e., one year of treatment.</p><p>
 dose modification for all patients 
 if severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with pegintron 
 monotherapy or pegintron in combination with ribavirin, modify the</p><p>dosages of each product if 
 appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose 
 modification (see dosage modification guidelines,</p></section><section><header>table 2a</header><p> for pegintron monotherapy and</p></section><section><header>table 2b</header><p>for pegintron combination therapy with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header>table 2a</header><p>dose modification guidelines for pegintron monotherapy</p></section><section><header>laboratory values reduce pegintron

 composition</header><p>pegintron is supplied in five dosage strengths: (50 µg, 80 µg, 100 µg, 120 µg, 150 µg) as a lyophilized powder to be reconstituted in 0.7 ml water for injections before use. the label dose is contained in 0.5 
 ml of the reconstituted solution. the composition of the excipient matrix is the same for all dosage 
 strengths; only the amount of the active ingredient varies. excipients are: sodium phosphate 
 dibasicanhydrous, sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate, sucrose, and polysorbate 80. 
 the strength is defined by weight in contrast to most interferon medicinal products, the strengths of 
 which are defined by bioactivity. although the proposed definition does not allow for a conclusive 
 direct comparison of 
 in vitro activity with other products of the kind, it is preferred from a clinical point of view, taking into account the kinetics which distinguish this product from non-pegylated 
 interferon alfa-2b. although not part of the labelled strength, the bioactivity of pegintron is controlled 
 as part of the product specifications.</p><p>
 the container is a 2 ml type i flint glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper and flip-off aluminium seal.</p></section><section><header>active substance</header><p>the active substance used to manufacture pegintron is a conjugate of the same active substance as used for introna, i.e. recombinant human interferon alfa-2b produced in 
 e. coli. peginterferonalfa-2b is prepared by reacting interferon alfa-2b with activated methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (peg). the 
 reaction involves the formation of a covalent bond between the mpeg and amino groups on the 
 interferon alfa-2b molecule. 
 appropriate molecular size characterization techniques (mass spectroscopy, sds-page and size 
 exclusion chromatography) were used to confirm that peginterferon alfa-2b is predominantly 
 composed of monopegylated species with small amounts of dipegylated species and free interferon.</p><p>
 in the thorough characterisation of the active substance, involving high-resolution ion exchange 
 chromatography, the monopegylated species were found to consist of a population of positional 
 isomers of varying biological activities. this substance heterogeneity results from a purification 
 process that removes the coupling and quenching reagents and to some extent di-peginterferon and 
 free interferon, but does not resolve the monopegylated positional isomers. isomer distribution data of 
 13 clinical batches have been submitted. the substance heterogeneity has been shown to be essentially consistent, thereby assuring a consistency of activity across the totality of the finished product.</p><p>medicinal product no longer authorised 4/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>development pharmaceutics</header><p>a lyophilised formulation of sodium phosphate, sucrose and polysorbate 80 was developed to avoid a certain degree of depegylation that occurred with the soluble formulation used during pre-clinical and 
 phase i clinical studies. 
 the sections dealing with the conjugation chemistry, the structural elucidation and the degradation 
 pathways are considered to represent the current state of art. also, in general the relevant eu 
 guidelines are met. the resolution of the separation process does not allow for base-line separation, 
 and therefore fraction selection relies on in-process control. this was a matter of points for 
 clarifications, which are now solved.</p></section><section><header>line extension: pegintron powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen</header><p>on 6 february 2002 a marketing authorisation was granted for pegintron powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen as a line extension to the existing marketing authorisation for 
 pegintron. this is a new presentation for pre-filled pens with the active substance, peginterferon alfa-
 2b,</p><p>remaining the same as that used for the vials. the product is intended for use in the same way and 
 on the same indications as pegintron vials. the formulations are identical but these new products are 
 presented in two-chamber cartridges and supplied in pre-assembled single dose pen devices. the front 
 chamber contains the lyophilised cake including the active ingredient and the rear chamber contains 
 the solvent, 0.5 ml of water for injections.</p><p>
 pegintron powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen is presented as 50, 80, 100, 
 120 and 150 microgram strengths. the pen delivers 50, 80, 100, 120 and 150 microgram / 0.5 ml in 
 doses between 0.3 and 0.5 ml and is adjustable in increments of 0.05 ml. the composition has been 
 adequately described. the active ingredient, together with excipients is in the lyophilised powder. the 
 excipients are disodium phosphate, anhydrous, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sucrose and 
 polysorbate 80. the solvent, water for injections, is provided in the second chamber of the two-
 chamber pre-filled pen.</p><p>
 the pegintron pre-filled pen is packaged in a two-chamber type i borosilicate glass cartridge.</p><p>the 
 two chambers are separated by a gray bromobutyl rubber (helvoet fm 457/0 gray) plunger. the filled 
 cartridge is permanently fitted into a plastic pen assembly. the reconstitution process is carried out 
 when the user pushes the upper subassembly and lower body together which push the plungers so that 
 the solvent is transferred from the rear chamber to the front</p><p>bypassing the centre rubber plunger by the 
 way of the bypass channel.</p><p> 
 the formulation of the lyophilised powder and also the solution after reconstitution are the same as for 
 the pegintron vial. the development pharmaceutics refers mostly to studies done for the vial product. 
 however, some additional development activities for the pre-filled pen such as determination of fill 
 volume, choice of packaging components and lyophilisation cycle development is satisfactorily 
 described. 
 integrity of the container/closure system has satisfactorily been performed by microbial challenge and 
 pressure challenge leak test according to iso 11608-3:1997. the needle supplied is ce-marked and 
 the sterilisation method is by irradiation.</p><p>
 the applicant has conducted stability studies on the finished product. the proposed shelf life of 1 year 
 is acceptable.</p><p>
 the polysorbate 80, used as an excipient, can be either of bovine or vegetable origin. the applicant 
 has provided a tse certificate of suitability for the material of bovine origin, and thereby 
 demonstrated compliance with directive 1999/82/ec (i.e shown compliance with the joint 
 cpmp/cvmp tse guideline).</p><p>

 emea 2005</p></section><section><header n="3">3. toxico-pharmacological aspects</header><p>the binding of interferon to specific cell surface receptor molecules signals the cell to produce a series of antiviral proteins. most of this act to inhibit the translation of viral proteins, but other steps in viral 
 replication is also affected. however, no cell or animal models of chronic hepatitis c infection exist. 
 furthermore, the assessment is restricted by the fact that human interferon alfa-2b is inactive in 
 rodents, and the activity is comparatively low in primates available for preclinical studies.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics</header><p>the comparisons of in vitro antiviral and immune system related effects between pegylated and non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b have been described. the innate biological activities of both compounds 
 are similar. 
 safety pharmacology. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, cns and renal effects were studied in rats (six) and cynomolgus monkeys (three). in monkeys a significant sustained increase (doubling) of the heart 
 rate was recorded in animals treated with a high dose, with a concomitant rise in body temperature. no 
 other significant effects were found on electrocardiographic parameters. additional information 
 provided shows that the increased heart rate in injected monkeys found during the safety 
 pharmacology studies is not specific for pegintron but is also caused by introna. 
 since there are no animal or cell culture models for hcv infection, no preclinical studies were 
 performed to demonstrate the antiviral pharmacodynamic activity by the combination of ribavirin and 
 interferon alfa-2b on hepatitis c virus.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>the bioavailability after subcutaneous injections was 60-90 % in monkeys. the plasma half-life was 13-25 hours, as compared to about 4 h for introna. distribution studies in rats indicated no 
 localization to any specific organ or tissue; elimination (as low molecular weight radioactivity) was 
 primarily through the kidneys.</p><p>
 two mechanisms may contribute to the pharmacokinetic profile of interferon activity in plasma after 
 the subcutaneous administration of pegintron to rats and monkeys.</p><p>
 the mechanism, which appears to have a greater role, is a prolonged terminal phase half-life, 
 indicating slower elimination of the molecule. the terminal phase half-life of interferon activity after 
 administration of pegintron was approximately 17-25 hours in rats and 24-35 hours in monkeys, 
 compared to approximately 4 hours after administration of introna. 
 another mechanism, which may contribute to the pk profile of ifn activity in plasma, is slower 
 absorption after subcutaneous administration. in man, the half-life for absorption of pegintron is 4.6 
 hours and for introna is 2.3 hours. 
 the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b administered concomitantly is available from 
 two preclinical studies conducted in monkeys. serum neutralizing factors are elicited by interferon 
 alfa-2b, and dosing was therefore limited to one-month duration.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>single dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys using up to several hundred times the intended clinical dose of pegintron, indicated a low order of toxicity in these animals.</p><p>
 repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with subcutaneous doses of pegintron every other day for one month.</p><p>
 important findings included dose-related decreases in all types of blood cells, serum proteins, calcium 
 phosphorus and potassium. the findings observed in pegintron-dosed monkeys were similar in nature 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 6/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 to those produced by introna. there was thus no unique toxicity due to the pegylation. greater incidence and/or severity of the findings were noted in the high-dosed monkeys compared to introna -
 dosed monkeys, which is in accordance with the prolonged exposure and higher auc values. 
 reversal of the findings were observed after several weeks of dosing, possibly due to the appearance 
 of neutralising activity to interferon alfa in monkeys. 
 in order to assess the effects of the combination peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, one-month 
 repeated toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys were performed. the duration of the studies was 
 limited to one month due to occurrence of neutralising antibodies directed to interferon. the 
 combination did not reveal unexpected new target organs but the effects were more marked with the 
 combination compared to each individual component. overall, there were changes in haematological 
 parameters (reduced numbers of erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes), lymphoid 
 organs (atrophy) and skin (inflammation, erosion and ulcers). one important aspect to consider is the 
 reduction in neutrophil numbers that is linked to peginterferon alfa-2b treatment. this reduction could 
 alter the host resistance to infections and may explain the few cases of mortalities reported. neutrophil 
 function was, however, not affected.</p><p>reproduction studies were not performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron can be assumed to also have this effect, as expressed adequately in the spc.</p><p>
 genotoxicity was studied using a standard battery of tests. all findings were negative. the dosing was limited to 175 µg/plate in the ames test, and 35 µg/ml in the chromosome aberration study, which, 
 although below the guideline recommendations, is considered acceptable due to the (protein) nature of 
 the test article. 
 carcinogenicity studies were not performed, which is acceptable since human interferon alfa has no apparent effect in rodents, and since antibodies are rapidly formed after administration of the 
 pegylated product. 
 local tolerance. subcutaneous injection of pegintron and placebo to rats, both produced mild irritation, as did intramuscular injection of pegintron to rabbits.</p><p>
 free methoxypoly (ethylene glycol) (mpeg) the relative non-toxicity of mpeg has been convincingly shown in the following studies:</p><p>
 single dose toxicity. mpeg given i.v. or subcutaneously at 6480 µg/m
 2 to mice and rats was non-toxic.</p><p>
 13-week study in rats. mpeg was given subcutaneously twice weekly in doses up to 2276 µg/m
 2/week (15 animals per sex per group). no mpeg-related findings were observed at macroscopic or 
 microscopic examinations. 
 13-week + 4-week recovery study in cynomolgus monkeys. mpeg was given subcutaneously twice 
 weekly in doses up to 2276 µg/m
 2/week (5 animals per sex per group). no mpeg-related findings were observed at macroscopic or microscopic examinations. 
 embryo-foetal development study in rats. mpeg was given daily in doses up to 800 µg/m
 2 per day on day 6 through 17 after mating (25 animals per group). no signs of toxicity, maternal or in utero 
 effects, were noted. 
 embryo-foetal development study in rabbits. mpeg was given daily in doses up to 800 µg/m
 2 per day on day 7 through 19 after mating (20 animals per group). no signs of toxicity, maternal or in utero 
 effects, were noted. 
 mutagenicity. mpeg up to 5000 µg/plate ±s9 was not mutagenic in the standard battery of salmonella 
 and escherichia strains.

 emea 2005 chromosomal aberration test. mpeg up to 5000 µg/ml of for 4 and 19 h without s9 and 4 h with s9 had no effect in a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test. 
 mouse micronucleus study. mpeg at a dose of 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally had no effect in a mouse 
 micronucleus assay</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical aspects 
  
 clinical pharmacology</header><p>pharmacodynamics. interferon pharmacodynamics was assessed by examining changes in concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-
 oas). serum neopterin levels, measured as both c
 max and auc, increased with dose until the maximum effect was reached at the 1.5 
 µg/kg dose. for 2’5’-oas the maximal effect was attained already at 0.25 – 0.50 
 µg/kg. pharmacokinetics. the single- and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of pegintron were evaluated in two studies, of which the multiple-dose study (0.5–2.0 µg/kg q.w.) was conducted in the target 
 population. pegintron was quantified using immuno- (mainly) and bioassays, the latter being a 
 measure of the antiviral activity. 
 pegintron is slowly absorbed following subcutaneous administration with the maximal serum 
 concentrations attained within 15-44 h, which are sustained for up to 48 to 72 h post-dose. cl/f 
 ranged from 11 to 33 ml/h/kg, which is about one-tenth of the cl/f of intron</p><p>a. 
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is about 1 l/kg, which is slightly less than for intron</p><p>a. 
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. as measured by the 
 bioassay, accumulation is less pronounced, fully in-line with available safety data. 
 mean pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 30.7 hours (range 27-33 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance. 
 a single-dose interaction study was conducted to assess the influence of pegintron on the most 
 important p-450 enzymes. results of this study demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome 
 (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in a 
 50% reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2. 
 in a dose ranging, pharmacokinetic study (study i96-403), it was demonstrated that there is no 
 pharmacokinetic interaction when peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin are co-administered. there was a 
 peginterferon alfa-2b dose-related effect on viral clearance, and this effect was further enhanced by the 
 addition of ribavirin. peginterferon alfa-2b at the dose of 1.4 micrograms/kg/week combined with 
 ribavirin (800 mg or 1000-1200 mg/day) had the best efficacy for clearing hcv-rna from the serum, 
 at weeks 1, 12 and 24, with an acceptable tolerance. 
 clinical studies in special populations. patients with decompensated liver function were not eligible in the clinical studies, therefore the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients 
 with severe hepatic dysfunction. 
 in patients with renal impairment the exposure, as determined by the immunoassay, was doubled in 
 the patients with the poorest renal function. renal elimination only contributed to about 30 % of the 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 8/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 overall elimination of pegintron. no further suggestions are given on additional mechanism of elimination.</p><p>
 there were no significant pharmacokinetic changes in elderly.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>the clinical efficacy data on which the initial application was based included two studies, which demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of pegintron: a small dose exploration study and a large pivotal 
 study. each compared various dose-regimens of pegintron with the approved dose of introna in 
 patients not previously treated with an interferon. 
 dose finding study. the dose exploration study was an open-label, active control study in which 64 
 patients naïve to interferon were randomized to receive treatment for 6 months with dosages of 
 pegintron varying from 0.25 
 µg/kg s.c. once weekly to 2.0 µg/kg s.c. once weekly. introna at the dose licensed for the treatment of chc was chosen as comparator. numerically favorable activity 
 compared with introna was observed for pegintron dosages between 0.5 and 2.0 
 µg/kg. serum neopterin concentration increased in a dose-related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions 
 at the end of week 4 also correlated with dose. 
 one pivotal confirmatory clinical study has been submitted as part of a variation application to support 
 the extension of the use of ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (study c/i98-580) in 
 patients with chronic hcv not previously treated with interferon (n = 1580).</p></section><section><header>main clinical studies</header><p>the main confirmatory study on which the initial application was based is a double blind, active control, randomized study conducted in the us, europe, and australia. the target population 
 comprised treatment-naive, adult subjects with chc confirmed by positive hcv-rna/qpcr 
 (national genetics institute), a liver biopsy within the previous year compatible with chronic hepatitis 
 and abnormal alt levels. compensated liver disease and essentially normal bone marrow function 
 was required. the study was randomised, four-armed, and double blind with regard to pegintron dose. 
 the licensed dose of introna for the treatment of chc (3 miu s.c. thrice weekly) was compared with 
 pegintron 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 
 µg/kg s.c. once a week for 48 weeks. for the assessment of sustained response, a 6 months follow-up after the end of therapy was conducted. 
 the characteristics of the patients and baseline disease parameters were comparable across all 
 treatment groups even though it was conducted in multiple geographic locations (table 1). these 
 characteristics are representative of the typical profile of a treatment-naïve patient with chronic 
 hepatitis c. 
 altogether 1224 patients were randomized and 1219 were treated.</p><p>

 the study was designed with a single measure of efficacy, but with assessments at two time-points. to 
 allow for this approach and to protect against type 1 error, the 
 α was split equally between the two time points (
 α = 0.025 x 2). the primary efficacy measure was a composite of viral response, hcv rna &lt;100 copies/ml (qpcr) and normalised alt. non-completers were classified as failures.</p><p>
 in long-term follow-up studies, virologic response as measured by sensitive quantitative pcr 
 techniques has been shown to have a strong correlation with eradication of hcv-rna and halt of 
 disease progression. the hcv-rna assay employed in this study is a commercially available service 
 and is a highly sensitive validated assay. undetectable serum hcv-rna is highly indicative of viral 
 clearance and predictive for the cure of chronic hepatitis c disease. moreover, it has been 
 demonstrated that virologic response corresponds highly with histologic improvement in the liver. 
 pegintron was superior to introna at both time points assessed in the study, as measured by loss of 
 serum hcv-rna during treatment and sustained virologic response six months post treatment. 
 significantly more patients were negative for serum hcv-rna with all three pegintron regimens 
 compared with introna (table 2). there was a dose response for the pegintron groups during 
 treatment, however, for sustained response the 1.0 and 1.5 
 µg/kg groups were similar.</p><p>

 the primary endpoint of the study was a combination of loss of serum hcv-rna plus normalization 
 of alt. however, sustained virologic response is the gold standard for assessing long-term response 
 to therapy and is therefore the focus of the assessment of efficacy in this application. 
 as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 3</header><p>, nearly all patients with a sustained virologic response also normalized alt; only 10/238 (4%) had alt levels above the upper limit or normal.

 when used as a surrogate for response, sustained normalization of alt was a relatively poor predictor

 therefore, virologic response is the optimal way to assess the efficacy of pegintron in this study as 
 normalization of alt is a less sensitive measure of outcome. 
 hcv genotype and pretreatment viral load have been shown to be predictors of response to 
 interferons. when considered by the subgroups of hcv genotype and viral load, the response rate for 
 all dose-regimens of pegintron remains superior to that with introna (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>). as has been shown in other studies, patients with hcv genotypes 2/3 have a much higher response rate than those with 
 genotype 1. patients with a low (
 ≤2 x 106 copies/ml) pretreatment hcv level have a higher response rate than their counterparts regardless of genotype.

 emea 2005 altogether, it is concluded that non-inferiority of pegintron in terms of efficacy has been demonstrated for the 0.5 
 µg/kg dose (17% sustained combined response) in relation to the licensed dose of introna (12%), as the 97.5% confidence interval for difference between pegintron 0.5 
 µg/kg and introna was (-2%; +11%) (primary endpoint). in terms of the presently preferred virology endpoint the p-value “in 
 favour of” pegintron 0.5 
 µg/kg was 0.042.</p><p>with respect to higher doses of pegintron, sustained viral response appears similar comparing peg 
 1.0 and 1,5 
 µg/kg, 25 and 23%, respectively. it therefore seems reasonable to focus on a comparison between the 0.5 and 1.0 
 µg/kg regimens. in this comparison the 95% ci for difference in sustained viral response rate is about –0.2% to +13% in favour of the 1.0 
 µg/kg dose.</p></section><section><header>combination peginterferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin</header><p>relating to the proposed indication, there is a synergistic effect, whose mechanism is unknown, of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b on the virologic sustained response and on the 
 histologic response in both relapse and naïve patients. 
 the efficacy and the safety of the combination was evaluated in study (c/i98-580), a large (n = 1580 
 randomised, 1530 treated), randomised (stratified: genotype 1 versus non-1, cirrhosis +/), multicentre, 
 open label and active control study, where patients received one of the following treatment: 
 •</p></section><section><header>i/r</header><p>: interferon alfa-2b 3miu three times weekly + ribavirin 1000/1200 mg (authorised posology) 
 •</p></section><section><header>peg1.5/r</header><p>: peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 microgram/kg once weekly in combination with ribavirin 800 mg daily for 48 weeks.</p><p>the dose of ribavirin was lower than that originally approved due to 
 safety concerns 
 •</p></section><section><header>peg0.5/r</header><p>: peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 microgram/kg once weekly for 4 weeks, dropping to 0.5 microgram/kg/week for a further 44 weeks in combination with ribavirin 1000/1200 mg daily</p><p>
 patients were instructed to take rebetol with food.</p><p>the primary efficacy variable was the loss of detectable serum hcv-rna/pcr (&lt; 100 copies/ml). 
 efficacy was evaluated at 24 weeks and also at follow-up (24 weeks after the end of treatment). 
 sustained response was determined by the proportion of subjects that were hcv-rna negative 24 
 weeks after the end of treatment. secondary endpoints were the normalisation of alt at the end of 
 treatment and at 24 weeks of follow-up, loss of hcv-rna at the end of treatment, and improvement 
 and change from baseline in biopsy scores.</p><p>
 population</p><p>all patients recruited were naive and had histological evidence of chronic hepatitis, with proof of 
 infection with hepatitis c virus (presence of serum hcv-rna) and abnormal alt. the patients 
 enrolled were predominantly caucasian, middle aged males (mean age 44 years). as it is typical with 
 european/american population, the majority were infected with genotype 1 (~ 70%) and had a high 
 viral load pre-study (&gt; 2 million copies/ml). baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
 consistent across all patients groups. approximately 10 % had cirrhosis as determined by local 
 pathologist assessment.</p><p>
 of the 1580 patients randomised, 1530 were treated (50 patients were not treated mainly due to patient 
 preference). overall 80 % (1230/1530) of patients completed 48 weeks of treatment. discontinuation 
 of treatment was mainly due to adverse events (14 %, 13 % and 13 % respectively for peg 1.5/r, 
 peg 0.5/r and i/r). all patients treated with at least one dose of study medication defined the itt 
 population.</p><p>
 virological response</p><p>

 a: logistic regression</p><p>secondary endpoint (alt normalisation)</p><p>with respect to the secondary endpoint of normalisation of alt, almost all subjects who became 
 sustained responders also normalised their alt after completion of therapy. among those few 
 sustained responders who failed to normalise their alt during follow-up, the alt was only 
 minimally elevated (&lt;1.5 uln) in the majority of the peginterferon alfa-2b treated patients.</p><p>
 doses recommendation</p><p>
 in this study, it was shown that dosing both peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin by patient weight 
 optimises sustained virologic response rates to treatment. 
 a logistic regression analysis of the weight effect demonstrated that weight-adjusted dosing for 
 ribavirin maximises the sustained virologic response rate (61 %) compared to 47 % with standard i/r 
 therapy. the sustained response rate with this regimen was improved to 48 % in the difficult to treat 
 hcv genotype 1 patients and to 88% in patients infected with hcv genotypes 2 &amp; 3; relapse rates 
 were reduced in these sub-populations 17 % and 7 %, respectively. the analysis confirmed that the 
 optimal dose of peginterferon alfa-2b is 1.5 micrograms/kg and demonstrated that the optimal dose of 
 ribavirin, balancing for efficacy and safety, for use in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 
 micrograms/kg is 13 
 ± 2 mg/kg for all patients; this is particularly effective for those infected with hcv genotype 1. 
 on the basis of the data, the following dose recommendation for ribavirin, in combination with 
 peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg per week) was defined: 
 • patients with body weight &lt; 65 kg, 800 mg/day • patients with body weight 65 - 85 kg, 1000 mg/day medicinal product no longer authorised 13/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 • patients with body weight &gt; 85 kg, 1200 mg/day duration of treatment</p><p>
 the efficacy of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b + ribavirin has been demonstrated in a large 
 clinical study.</p><p>the sustained response rate with peg 1.5/r 6 months after the end of 1 year of 
 treatment was significantly higher than that with i/r (54% versus 47%; p = 0.0121).</p><p>it was 
 demonstrated that the response rate was optimised when both peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin are 
 dosed according to body weight. the sustained response rate increased up to 61% with peg 1.5/r 
 with the optimised ribavirin dose (&gt; 10.6 mg/kg). in the subgroup of patients infected with genotype 1 
 the response rate was 48% (versus 33% with the regimen i/r) and for genotype2/3 patients was 88% 
 (versus 79% with the regimen i/r) when the ribavirin dose was optimised.</p><p>the rationale for selecting a fixed treatment period of 1 year in this study was the type of patients 
 anticipated to be enrolled (~ 70 % genotype 1/high viral load). the risk of over-treating some patients 
 and inducing undue adverse events could not be excluded. in genotype 1 patients with a high viral 
 load at baseline, it was shown that a treatment for 48 weeks was necessary to establish high sustained 
 response rate. therefore a 6 months treatment period was agreed, with the automatic extension of this 
 treatment period to another 6 months in genotype 1 patients with high baseline viral load who exhibit 
 negative hcv rna after the first 6 months. for the other patients, the possibility to extend the 
 treatment period for another 6 months can be considered.</p><p>
 the optimal duration of the combined treatment has not yet been fully established in subjects with non 
 type 1 genotype infections or type 1 genotype infections with low baseline viral load. the information 
 provided on the overall population at present indicate that the treatment should be continued at least 
 for 24 weeks and thereafter the patients shall be re-evaluated in order to extend the treatment up to one 
 year. it was considered that a number of prognostic factors would be involved in the clinical decision 
 of continuing the treatment beyond 24 weeks, including the level of bridging fibrosis, the level of 
 response in terms of viral load, age, gender, tolerability to the treatment of individual patients. the 
 marketing authorisation holder has agreed to provide the cpmp with additional information on the 
 clinical benefit of the optimised dosing regimen of the combined treatment for specific subgroups of 
 hepatitis c patients.</p></section><section><header>clinical studies in special populations</header><p>use in hepatic impairment: the safety and efficacy of pegintron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore pegintron must not be used for these patients. 
 patients with decompensated liver function were not eligible in the clinical studies, however the 
 cpmp requested clarifications whether there were pharmacokinetic data available from patients with 
 histologically proven cirrhosis at baseline. the analysis of pharmacokinetics data in cirrhotic patients 
 (metavir iv) from a population pk substudy of the pivotal clinical trial (c/i97-010) was made. due to 
 the small number of patients with metavir scores of 4, an adequate comparison of their trough 
 concentration data with those of patients with lower scores was not possible. 
 use in renal impairment: the clearance of pegintron is reduced in patients with significant renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 ≤ 50 ml/minute) (see</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2</header><p>). it is recommended that these patients be closely monitored and that their weekly dose of pegintron be reduced if medically appropriate. 
 use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age): there are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of pegintron. data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of pegintron suggest no alteration in 
 pegintron dose is necessary based on age (see</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2</header><p>). use in patients under the age of 18 years: pegintron is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under the age of 18, as there is no experience in this group.

 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>patient exposure the safety assessment in this application is based primarily on data from the pivotal study in which most of the 1,219 patients completed the one-year treatment period and were followed for 6 months. 
 given the small number of patients (36) treated in the supportive dose exploration study, this study 
 was of minor importance for the assessment of safety.</p><p>
 altogether 940 patients in the pivotal study were exposed to pegintron, of whom 754 received 0.5 to 
 1.5 microgram/kg for a year. all patients were followed for an additional 6 months post-treatment. 
 the most commonly reported aes were those typically associated with interferon use, headache and 
 myalgia, which were reported by a majority of patients (both pegintron and introna). 
 the side effect profile observed for pegintron was qualitatively similar to that of introna. the 
 incidence and severity of adverse events reported for the lowest dose of pegintron appeared similar to 
 introna 3 miu, while flu-like symptoms, weight loss, anorexia, dizziness and alopecia tended to be 
 more frequently observed with higher dosages of pegintron. 
 the incidences of the most common adverse events observed in monotherapy treatment are 
 summarized in table 6. in general, the severity of the adverse events in all treatment groups was mild 
 to moderate and manageable by appropriate additional therapy and adjustment of the dose of the study 
 drug.</p><p>

 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the two most common reasons for dose reduction. dose 
 interruption was more common with introna (9%) than with pegintron (4-6%). a relatively small 
 proportion of subjects in each group discontinued (2-5%) or dose reduced (1-3%) due to psychiatric 
 aes. depression was the most common reason for discontinuation or dose reduction due a 
 psychiatric ae. 
 application site disorders have been reported with the use of all alpha interferons. the incidence of 
 injection site inflammation (erythema and/or swelling) with pegintron at all doses was greater than 
 that seen with introna (44-47% vs 21%), but was not dose related. the majority were mild in severity. 
 no patient experienced local skin necrosis. less common were pain or reactions (i.e. bruising, 
 itchiness, and irritation). 
 laboratory findings as for introna, reduced neutrophil and platelet counts developed within a few weeks of therapy and changes thereafter were minor (table 8).

 fluctuation of alt values is characteristic of chronic hepatitis c infection. this variation is also seen 
 during treatment with interferons. looking at individual patients, there were 97 patients with a during-

 there was no specific pattern as to when the elevations of alt occurred. with the exception of one 
 patient, whose maximum total bilirubin was 33 
 µmol/l (predominantly indirect bilirubin), the alt elevations were not associated with simultaneous increase in bilirubin or clinical signs of hepatoxicity. 
 forty-four pegintron-treated patients had an elevated bilirubin value, none sufficient to cause clinical 
 jaundice. these elevations were equally distributed across the pegintron groups. of these one had a 
 concomitant elevated alt value. 
 the prevalence of post-treatment binding antibody in the main clinical study was 9.1-10.2% among all 
 pegintron dose groups and was lower than that detected for introna in the same trial (15.2%). serum 
 neutralising antibody was also detected in small but similar proportions of subjects receiving introna 
 or pegintron (0.8-1.9%). 
 in general, only high titres of antibodies are supposed to influence the kinetics of proteins, and a high 
 titre of binding antibodies normally correlates with neutralising activity. the low incidence of 
 neutralising antibodies is therefore reassuring. 
 health-related quality of life (hql) data was collected using the sf36 module as described in the 
 clinical protocol for c/i97-010. the sf36 assesses eight domains of health; physical functioning, role 
 physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and 
 general mental health. data were collected at baseline, at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks during treatment 
 (treatment period), and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation (follow-up period). the 
 hql analyses were based on all randomised patients who received study drug.</p><p>
 in general, patients from all treatment groups showed reductions in scores for all hql domains tested 
 during treatment followed by a return back to baseline during follow-up. secondary analyses showed 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 17/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 that patients receiving pegintron 0.5 µg/kg experienced the least decrease in the following domain scores compared to introna and the higher doses of pegintron: role-physical, bodily pain, vitality, and 
 social functioning. at the end of follow-up, sustained responders in all pegintron groups showed 
 increased scores from baseline across all domains compared to non-responders who showed 
 reductions in mean scores. 
 combination peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin: the safety profile of peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin was assessed based on data from study (c/i98-580), which became available following the initial marketing authorisation.</p></section><section><header>adverse events</header><p>overall, the adverse events reported with the combination were as expected with interferon alfa-2b and/or ribavirin. the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin had a safety profile 
 comparable to the combination of interferon alfa-2b + ribavirin.</p><p>
 the most common adverse events with peginterferon alfa-2b + ribavirin (fatigue, fever, headache, 
 injection site reaction, rigors, myalgia, insomnia) were also those most frequently reported with i/r.</p><p>
 the increase in the incidence of some flu-like symptoms with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 
 micrograms/kg was not unexpected given the higher dose of interferon alfa-2b being administered. 
 the incidence of psychiatric adverse events was similar among groups. few adverse events, such as 
 injection site reaction (58% vs. 36%), fever (46% vs. 33%) and nausea (43% vs. 33%) were more 
 common with peg 1.5/r than with i/r (
 ≥10% difference between groups).</p><p>however, most of these events were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit treatment. comparing peginterferon alfa-2b 
 1.5/r to i/r, the optimised dose of ribavirin was associated with a higher incidence of 5 adverse 
 events for which the incidence between treatments was 
 ≥ 10 %: injection site reaction, weight decrease, nausea, asthenia and alopecia. 
 serious psychiatric adverse events are uncommon, but are recognised problem with interferon alpha 
 treatment. during the 48-week treatment period, adverse events broadly classified as “psychiatric” 
 were reported by approximately 75-77% of patients across all groups. the majority of these were mild 
 or moderate and not significantly psychiatric, such as insomnia (40-41%) and irritability (34-35%). 
 depression was reported by 29-34% of patients, this compares with 
 ≈28% reported in previous trials with peginterferon alfa-2b monotherapy and i/r. the incidence of depression was similar in all 3 
 groups and remained relatively constant during the study period (66-68% in the second 24 weeks vs. 
 71-73% in the first 24 weeks), demonstrating there is no increased risk of depression with longer 
 treatment duration. there was no difference in the incidence of psychiatric adverse events between the 
 per protocol peg 1.5/r group and the optimised ribavirin dose group.</p></section><section><header>severe and life-threatening adverse events</header><p>the incidence of severe aes in every body system organ class category was similar with peg 1.5/r and i/r, with the exception of “body as a whole” and “white cell and res”, where severe fatigue and 
 neutropenia were more frequently reported with peg 1.5/r than with i/r. 
 the frequency of life threatening aes reported in this study was low (1 %) and was similar between 
 the treatment groups. all were successfully managed with treatment discontinuation. there were 13 
 cases of neutropenia classified as who grade 4(life-threatening), none of which was associated with 
 infection. for the peg 1.5/r group there is no pattern to suggest that the optimised dose of ribavirin 
 resulted in more life-threatening events. the incidence of suicidal attempts and suicidal ideation 
 during treatment with the combination ribavirin/peginterferon alfa-2b was low (
 ≤ 1.2 %) and similar in all groups. specific reference to these life-threatening psychiatric events observed during treatment in 
 this clinical study has been added in the spc.</p><p>
 6.6% of the relapse patients and 11% of naïve experienced severe and life-threatening events pooled 
 from four phase iii trials. the most common are psychiatric, the category which occurred more 
 frequently comparing i/r (2%) and i/p (1%). there were 6 deaths, 5 in the naïve patients and 1 in the 
 relapse patient trials: two myocardial infarctions, two cases of illicit drug overdose, and an intracranial 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 18/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 haemorrhage. of the 6 patients who died, 3 were randomized to combination therapy and 2 of the deaths occurred during the follow up period (16-20 weeks after dosing completion).</p></section><section><header>laboratory values and relationship to infection</header><p>there was a clear dose-relationship in the frequency of neutropenia with peginterferon alfa-2b.</p><p>there was also a dose-effect in the proportion of patients who had a dose modification due to neutropenia 
 (18 % with peg 1.5/r compared with 10 and 8 % for peg 0.5/r and i/r).</p><p>however, the incidence of 
 discontinuation for neutropenia was low in all groups (0.2 –1 %). in this study, only 5 peg 1.5/r 
 subjects and 2 i/r subjects discontinued because of neutropenia suggesting that the dose-modification 
 schedule included in the protocol provided adequate protection. there was a higher frequency of 
 grade 3/4 neutropenia when peginterferon alfa-2b was combined with the optimised of ribavirin; 
 however, this was also seen with interferon alfa-2b. among the subjects who had a grade 3 or 4 
 neutropenia, the incidence of infections was similar: 47 % peg 1.5/r, 39 % peg 0.5/r; 55 % i/r. a 
 mention on the risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia associated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin has been 
 added to the spc.</p><p>
 nine subjects reported serious infections.</p><p>these serious infections were neither associated with 
 neutropenia nor life threatening.</p><p>the optimised dose of ribavirin did not influence the pattern of 
 infections.</p><p>
 anaemia is a well-recognised effect of ribavirin and the pattern previously observed with ribavirin in 
 combination with interferon alfa-2b is seen in this study. a decrease in haemoglobin to less than 10 
 g/dl, which mandates dose modification, occurred in approximately 10% of patients; discontinuation 
 was rare (0.2 – 0.8 %).</p><p>guidelines for dose reduction for anaemia are included in the rebetol spc.</p><p>
 as would be expected, the higher (optimised) dose of ribavirin resulted in a greater number of patients 
 having a decrease in haemoglobin to less than 10 g/dl, with the need for dose modification. this 
 occurred in approximately 12-14% of patients receiving the &gt;10.6 mg/kg dose of ribavirin.</p><p>
 grade 1-2 thrombocytopenia was significantly higher with peg1.5/r than with i/r, however, no 
 significant clinical consequences were observed during the study.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation and dose modification</header><p>discontinuation due to adverse events was similar among all treatment groups (13-14 %). the most frequent reasons for discontinuations in all treatment groups were flu-like symptoms (2-3 %) and 
 psychiatric adverse events (5%).</p><p>
 the most common reasons for dose modification due to adverse events were anaemia and neutropenia. 
 dose modification for psychiatric adverse events was low in all groups (4-5 %).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment</header><p>from a chemical-pharmaceutical and toxicological point of view, satisfactory responses to the points for clarification have been submitted. 
 taking into account both the preclinical data and the clinical exposure to peginterferon alfa-2b, it is 
 concluded that the benefit/risk for the use in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c (chc) 
 is positive. the cpmp have previously agreed that the optimum treatment for chc is the combination 
 of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. for this reason pegintron, and all interferon monotherapies, should 
 be used primarily in patients intolerant of ribavirin. 
 from an efficacy point of view, pegintron 0.5 
 µg/kg has been demonstrated to be non-inferior and the 1.0 
 µg/kg to be superior compared with the licensed dose of introna. the 1.0 µg/kg dose, however, appears to be less well tolerated and dose reduction and discontinuation of therapy were more 
 commonly encountered. it should be noted that these differences in safety do not relate to irreversible 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 19/19</p><p> 
 emea 2005 adverse events. dosing can be individualized taking into account expected viral response and tolerability. 
 when reviewing the clinical data of peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in naive 
 patients, which became available after the initial granting of the marketing authorisation, the cpmp 
 considered that the benefit/risk profile of pegintron was still favourable.</p><p>
 indeed, it was demonstrated that use in combination of peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin offers greater 
 efficacy than the current standard of care interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin without the introduction of 
 any new adverse events, although the frequency of a few of the interferon-related events was affected. 
 all the aes appeared to resolve with dose-modification or discontinuation, without clinical sequelae.</p><p>
 further refinement of the data analyses demonstrated also that weight adjusted dosing for both 
 peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin maximises the sustained virological response rate. it was concluded 
 that the peg 1.5/r regimens is adopted for all patients, but with the ribavirin dose modified to take 
 account of the impact of body weight. the peginterferon alfa-2b regimen is already weight adjusted. 
 the ribavirin dose of 13 
 ± 2 mg/kg/day is the optimal dose for use in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 
 µg/kg/week without compromising safety.</p><p>this combination will provide an increased sustained response rate for all patients, particularly those infected with genotype 1. in addition, the 
 optimisation of ribavirin dose had an effect on the frequency of only a few of the ribavirin-related 
 events.</p><p>
 hence, the cpmp agreed on the following dosing recommendations:</p><p>
 peginterferon alfa-2b: 1.5 
 µg/kg/week ribavirin 13 
 ± 2 mg/kg/day as:</p><p>
 800 mg/day for patients weighing &lt; 65 kg</p><p>
 1,000 mg/day for patients weighing 65 to 85 kg</p><p>
 1,200 mg/day for patients weighing &gt; 85 kg</p><p>
 the optimal dose recommendations have been reconsidered and agreed upon. as far as the treatment 
 duration is concerned, the cpmp agreed that it should last for at least six months. in genotype 1 
 patients with high baseline viral load, treatment should be continued for another six-month period in 
 patients who exhibit negative hcv-rna after the first six months treatment. for the other patients, 
 the possibility to extend the treatment period for another 6 months can be considered on individual 
 basis. the marketing authorisation holder has agreed to provide the cpmp with additional 
 information on the clinical benefit of the optimised dosing regimen of the combined treatment for 
 specific subgroups of hepatitis c patients. 
 based on the available data on quality, safety and efficacy, the cpmp considered that the benefit/risk 
 profile of peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
 was favourable, and recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for the following 
 indication: 
 pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis c 
 who has elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum hcv-
 rna or anti-hcv.</p><p>
 the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.</p><p>
 this combination is indicated in naïve patients as well as in patients who have previously responded 
 (with normalisation of alt at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have 
 subsequently relapsed.</p><p>
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.</p><p>
