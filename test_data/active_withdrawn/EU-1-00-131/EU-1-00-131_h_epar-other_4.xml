 introduction</header><p>pegintron/viraferonpeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum hepatitis c virus 
 ribonucleic acid (hcv-rna) or anti-hcv, including naïve patients with clinically stable hiv co-
 infection in combination with ribavirin. this combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients 
 with clinically stable hiv coinfection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon 
 alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy.</p><p>
 the mah applies to extend the therapeutic indication of pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with 
 rebetol capsules or oral solution (ribavirin) to the paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis c. 
 a type ii variation application has been submitted in parallel for both pegintron/viraferonpeg and 
 rebetol.</p><p>
 to support this variation the mah submitted one pivotal study (p02538) evaluating the safety and 
 efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c (chc). there is a 
 planned 5 year long- term follow-up portion of the study.</p></section><section><header>i.2 
 scientific overview and discussion</header><p>hepatitis c is a milder disease in children than in adults with a less frequent and a slower progression. severe hepatitis and cirrhosis are very infrequent complications (2-4%) in childhood up to 20 years post 
 infection in the absence of associated conditions (polytransfusion infection, chemotherapy, hiv or 
 hepatitis b virus (hbv) co-infection) [1,6]. chronic infection is asymptomatic in most cases, with 
 minimal histological lesions in 80% cases, as assessed when analysing results of biopsies from 300 
 children aged 6-10 yrs with a chronic hepatitis c since 3-7 yrs. significant fibrosis was present in 15% 
 cases, cirrhosis in &lt; 4% [2.3.4.5].</p><p>fibrosis progression, histological score, alanine transaminase (alt) levels and viral load were lower in 
 children when compared to adults over a 10 years period [6] hepatocellular carcinoma as the result of 
 chc is extremely rare in childhood, and only a few cases have been reported.</p><p>
 even though important inter-individual variations exist, and severe evolution may be observed in childhood, 
 some data demonstrate an overall mild pathology in children, with a low rate of complications in the adult age 
 in the absence of alcohol consumption and of another hepatic disease.</p><p>
 with regards to treatment, for adults the goal of therapy is to avoid progression towards the life threatening 
 conditions that are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). in adults, the standard of care is treatment 
 of patients at risk of progression or of “easy-to-treat” patients (genotypes 2/3 without co-factors), with the 
 combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon. in the difficult-to-treat g1 patients, the efficacy of 
 pegylated inf plus ribavirin provided an approximately 10% increase in the rate of sustained responders 
 when compared to the combination with standard interferon.</p><p>
 regarding treatment in children, due to the relatively slow progression of the disease, the potential for 
 spontaneous clearance of the infection (in approximately 20% of cases and up to 45%) and the typically 
 asymptomatic or mild nature of the disease, it is mostly considered that treatment could be deferred to 
 adulthood or initiated only in the presence of progressing disease. the national institute of health (nih) 
 3/22 medicinal product no longer authorised consensus conference for the management of hepatitis c confirmed the most frequent “wait and see” strategy towards management of chc in children.</p><p>
 there is to date no clear international consensus for the treatment of children and treatment seems 
 restricted to children</p><p>with rapidly progressive disease (most often polytransfused, receiving chemotherapy 
 or hiv/hbv co-infected), and treatment strategy is assessed on a case by case basis.</p><p>
 in january 2005, interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin were granted an extension of indication for use in 
 children from 3 years with chronic hepatitis c. the clinical development consisted of 4 open studies with 
 only 1 phase iii study (p00321) in 70 paediatric subjects aged 3 through 16 years. during the assessment 
 of the dossier several safety concerns were identified, in particular growth retardation and psychiatric 
 disorders since a higher rate of suicidal attempt/ideation compared to adult patients was reported. of note, 
 the impact of growth was principally marked by a decrease in linear growth and weight gain. these data 
 were later substantiated by data from 97 children enrolled in the long-term pediatric study p01906 
 showing that twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 
 10 of the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to 
 the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years) raising a concern towards potential non reversibility of the 
 growth inhibition.</p><p>
 although pegylated interferon is considered to have a clear therapeutic advantage over standard interferon 
 in terms of efficacy (like for adults) the safety signal of non reversible growth inhibition identified with 
 standard interferon raise the same safety concern on the use of the pegylated bitherapy in childhood.</p><p>
 taking into account the safety concerns of bitherapy in children the chmp agreed that the scientific 
 advisory group should be requested to consider when treatment of hepatitis c should be initiated in 
 childhood, the safety profile of bitherapy in children and the place of bitherapy with standard interferon as 
 compared to bitherapy with pegylated interferon. the list of questions to the sag was adopted in march 
 2009. the sag meeting was held in may 2009.</p><p>
 overall the sag experts were not reassured that there is no irreversible growth retardation associated with 
 the bitherapy.</p><p>
 regarding treatment initiation in children, the sag concluded that early fibrosis is a criterion for 
 treatment initiation. due to the high response rates of around 90% in patients with genotypes 2 and 3, as 
 well as considering the potentially shorter treatment duration of 6 months, initiation of treatment in this 
 population could also be considered. however, there was a mixed view amongst sag experts whether in 
 this case it might be more appropriate to defer treatment given the safety issues as well as the fact that 
 treatment in (early) adulthood would also lead to similar response rates. for genotypes 1 and 4 the 
 potential risks together with the lower response rates and the longer treatment period required made the 
 sag experts only recommended closer monitoring, i.e. every 3-5 years. the recommendation was that 
 treatment initiation should only occur in case of early fibrosis.</p><p>
 the sag experts agreed that treatment can be initiated after the pubertal growth spurt as the risk of 
 growth retardation is no longer of clinical relevance. this recommendation can be given irrespective of 
 genotype and the presence of early fibrosis as the treatment responses in children with genotypes 1 and 4 
 are superior to those in adults.</p><p>
 the pubertal period should be avoided for treatment. whether there is an option for treatment prior to 
 pubertal period cannot be concluded due to the lack of sufficient data in final growth outcomes in younger 
 children.</p><p>
 4/22 medicinal product no longer authorised the sag experts agreed that adequate warnings in the summary of product characteristics (spc)/ package leaflet (pl) are an important element to highlight that the risk of irreversible growth inhibition 
 cannot be excluded; the proposed wording was not discussed further.</p><p>
 however, the sag experts felt strongly that it needs to be ensured that information about the safety risk 
 “growth retardation” is provided to parents and – as appropriate – to the concerned child upfront in the 
 consenting process prior to treatment initiation. it is acknowledged that parents have a particular role in 
 the treatment decision in this case, and might request treatment if deferral is recommended, hence full 
 information is a pre-requisite.</p><p>
 regarding the place of bitherapy with standard interferon as compared to bitherapy with pegylated 
 interferon there is higher response rates, shorter treatment duration for genotype 2 and 3 and once weekly 
 dosing regimen versus 3 times a week for standard interferon. as such, the sag experts felt confident that 
 pegylated interferon would replace standard interferon in medical practice provided a license for the use of 
 pegylated interferon in children was granted.</p></section><section><header>i.3 
 non clinical aspects</header><p>no non clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies have been submitted by the mah in support of this extension of indication. however ribavirin juvenile toxicology studies have been 
 performed post approval of the paediatric indication of interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. in order to better 
 appreciate the potential impact of the ribavirin safety profile in children, and in particular the potential 
 impact of ribavirin to affect growth, the mah committed to conduct a dose range-finding study to define 
 a maximum tolerated dose for ribavirin in rat pups and a juvenile toxicity study to assess effects on 
 growth, skeletal formation, and reproductive development and function. assessment of these studies led to 
 the update of the rebetol spc to draw the attention of prescribers to these non animal data in line with the 
 concern raised in clinic. (commission decision 04/01/2007).</p><p>
 as for standard interferon, no juvenile study has been conducted with peginterferon alfa-2b due to 
 feasibility issue (antibodies development in chronic treatment).</p></section><section><header>environmental risk assessment</header><p>no data were submitted by the mah as regards the environmental risk assessment. as the pec surface water for the active ingredient peginterferon alfa-2b is clearly below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l no 
 further action is required and the environmental risk assessment can be stopped in phase i.</p><p>
 the mah has not performed an octanol-water partition coefficient study with peginterferon alfa-2b and 
 requested a waiver to perform this test given the nature of peginterferon alfa-2b, which is a polyethylene 
 glycol-modified derivative of introna (human recombinant interferon alfa-2b). proteins are polar, water-
 soluble compounds. even if the log k
 ow has not been calculated, it can be assumed that it is below the trigger value of 4.5.</p><p>

 clinical aspects</header><p>in support of this extension of indication of the combination peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin to children and adolescents 3 years of age and older, the mah submitted study p02538 (n=107). the primary 
 objectives of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
 peginterferon alfa-2b 60µg/m
 2 once weekly plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day in paediatric subjects with chc.</p></section><section><header>i.4.1 
 pharmacokinetic</header><p>the secondary objective of study p02538 was to measure the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of peg2b and ribavirin in paediatric subjects with chc in order to develop population pharmacokinetic models to 
 describe peg2b and ribavirin disposition in hcv-infected paediatric subjects and to evaluate the effect of 
 covariates on peg2b and ribavirin pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 twenty one subjects were enrolled in the pharmacokinetic group (pk subjects) and had intensive blood 
 sample collections at weeks 1, 4, and 8. the other 86 subjects (profile pharmacokinetic group, ppk 
 subjects) had sparse blood sample collections at treatment weeks (tw) 4, 6, 12, 24, 30, and 48 for profile 
 pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 a nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach was used to analyse the ribavirin and pegintron data. the 
 primary objective of the ppk analysis was to estimate exposure of peginterferon in the paediatric 
 population receiving 60µg/m
 2/week. on the basis of the model, it was shown that exposure to peginterferon in children was 58% higher than observed in adults dosed with 1.5 µg/kg/week. however no 
 particular signal was raised towards a worsening of the haematologic or psychiatric adverse events as 
 compared to adults in relation to this over-exposure. furthermore, the proposed 1.5µg/kg dose was 
 considered acceptable as it allows an enhancement of the response rate as compared to standard ifn.</p></section><section><header>i.4.2 
 clinical pharmacology</header><p>the dose of rebetol and pegintron selected for study p02538 are pegintron 60 µg/m2 once weekly (qw) plus rebetol 15 mg/kg/day (in two divided doses).</p><p>
 the dose of pegintron to be used for this clinical study, 60 µg/m
 2 qw, is approximately equivalent to the dose licensed for adults in the us and the eu based on calculated conversion to body surface area 
 (1.5µg/kg/week). a body surface area (bsa)-based dosing of pegylated interferon was chosen by the 
 mah since judged appropriate to adjust the dose in paediatric patients on the basis of a similar mean 
 bsa-normalised apparent clearance across the different paediatric age groups. no comparison with 
 clearance from adults was nevertheless provided.</p><p>
 a dose ranging pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic</p><p>(pk/pd) study (p00018 cohort 1) identified the 15mg/kg dose as the optimal dosage of ribavirin in children. this dose was further evaluated in clinical 
 phase ii (p000018 cohort 2) and iii (p00321) in combination with introna.</p></section><section><header>i.4.3 
 clinical efficacy</header><p>the clinical study, p02538, is provided as a pivotal study to support the efficacy and safety of combination therapy pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus rbv in patients 3 years of age and older. the study 
 is presented hereafter:</p><p>

 6/22 medicinal product no longer authorised</p><p>study design phase 3/1b, open-label, global, multicenter study in paediatric patients who were all treated with peg2b plus ribavirin for up to 48 weeks and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-treatment. subjects with 
 genotype 1, 4, 5, 6, or high-viral-load (≥600,000 iu/ml) genotype 3 whose treatment week (tw) 12 
 hcv-rna levels were above the lower limit of quantitation (llq) and had dropped &lt;2 log10 as 
 compared to baseline values were to discontinue treatment at tw 18 and proceed to follow-up, unless the 
 principal investigator discussed and obtained approval from the sponsor&apos;s project physician prior to the 
 continuation of therapy beyond tw 18. subjects who had tw 12 hcv-rna levels that were below llq 
 were to continue therapy to 48 weeks. subjects whose tw 12 hcv-rna levels were above llq and had 
 dropped ≥2 log10 as compared to baseline values were to continue therapy and be reassessed at tw 24. if 
 the tw 24 hcv rna levels remained above llq, these subjects were to discontinue therapy at tw 30 
 and proceed to follow-up. subjects with hcv genotype 2 or low-viral-load (&lt;600,000 iu/ml) and 
 genotype 3 were to receive 24 weeks of treatment plus 24 weeks of follow-up.</p><p>
 subjects who were treated with at least one dose of peg2b and ribavirin and who completed the 24-week 
 post-treatment follow-up were eligible for enrollment in the 5-year long-term follow-up portion of the 
 study.</p><p>
 objectives</p><p>the primary objective of this study was to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the combination of peg2b 60 μg/m
 2 qw plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day in paediatric subjects with chc. the secondary objective was to measure the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of peg2b and ribavirin in paediatric 
 subjects with chc. there is a planned 5 year long- term follow-up portion of the study.</p><p>
 study participants</p><p> planned enrolment was for 100 paediatric subjects with chc. 107 subjects, including 67 aged 3-11 years and 40 aged 12- 17 years were enrolled and treated.</p><p>
 eligible subjects were male and female children and adolescents, 3 through 17 years of age, weighing</p><p>
 ≤90 kg, who had a diagnosis of chc documented by a positive anti-hcv or hcv-rna for at least</p><p>
 6 months prior to screening, with a liver biopsy (historical or pretreatment) showing evidence of fibrosis 
 and/or inflammatory activity. a liver biopsy waiver was possible for children 3-11 years old with an 
 elevated alt within 1 year prior to the screening 1 visit.</p><p> 
 patients were excluded from entry if having serum alt level &gt;10 times uln, evidence of decompensated 
 liver disease, known coinfection with either hiv or hbv, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or poorly 
 controlled noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, pre-existing psychiatric condition, including but not 
 limited to moderate to severe depression, or a history of severe psychiatric disorder, such as psychosis, 
 suicidal ideation and/or suicidal attempt.</p><p>
 treatments</p><p>peg2b; 60 μg/m2 qw; administered by sc injection. ribavirin; 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for up to 48 weeks (the maximum dose of ribavirin was not to exceed 1200 mg/day); administered po with 
 food.</p><p>
 efficacy analyses the primary efficacy variable is the proportion of subjects with sustained virologic response (svr) at</p><p>24 weeks following the end of treatment. for the primary efficacy analysis, any subject with undetectable 
 hcv rna level at the follow-up week 24 visit was considered a sustained virologic responder. 
 additional, &quot;carry-forward&quot;, efficacy analyses were conducted in subjects with undetectable hcv rna 
 level at the follow-up week 12 visit and missing data for follow-up week 24 were also considered to be 
 sustained responders and were summarised by age group. the proportion of sustained virologic 
 7/22 medicinal product no longer authorised responders was estimated using the normal approximation to the binomial. ninety-five percent confidence intervals of the proportion of sustained virologic responders were computed for each of the two age 
 groups (3-11 years old and 12-17 years old).</p></section><section><header>plasma hcv-rna assay</header><p>the mah informed the chmp in february 2007 that in some instances the hcv-rna assays conducted in the company’s laboratories (in-house polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay) to quantitatively assess 
 hcv-rna from subjects samples in this clinical trial had underreported the levels of hcv-rna as 
 evidence by the underrecovery of the positive control. a substantial proportion of samples were impacted 
 in study p02538 (23%). a corrective action plan was developed by the mah that included the 
 development of new and revised procedures with additional assay and laboratory controls to ensure 
 confidence in the robustness of the assay and retesting of the impacted samples. all but 11 samples in 
 study p02538 were retested. among the 11 subjects with insufficient plasma available to be retested, it is 
 noteworthy that under-reporting of hcv rna due to assay problem led to inadequate management in</p><p>
 3 patients (early stopping rule was mistakenly not applied). svr was however achieved in one of these 
 patients. the data presented in this report constitutes the retested sample data.</p></section><section><header>results   
 patient disposition</header><p>one hundred seven subjects were enrolled. patient disposition was as follows and presented in table 1 below
 :</p><p>all patients in the 24-weeks treatment arm (n=27) completed the treatment phase. on the contrary, only 64% (51/80) of patients in the 48-week treatment arm (equally shared between the 2 age groups) 
 completed treatment phase due to a high rate of treatment failure. indeed, contrarily to the 24-week 
 treatment group, stopping rule (at tw 12 and tw24) were applied for subjects assigned to the 48-week 
 treatment group (i.e. for g 1, 4, 5, or 6 or high-viral-load g3)</p></section><section><header>baseline characteristics</header><p>paediatric patients included in this study had similar demographic characteristics to children that were included in the paediatric study using introna and rbv (p00321) although study p02538 included more 
 caucasians (89% vs 80%) and patients were a little younger in this study (median age: 9 vs 10.5). subjects 
 weighting less than 47kg were to receive rbv oral solution. as a consequence, 94% (63/67) of younger 
 children (3-11 years old) received oral solution and 78% (31/40) of adolescents (12-17 years old) received 
 rbv capsule. 63% of paediatric patients included in this study were aged 3-11 years, of which most 
 8/22 medicinal product no longer authorised (67%) were aged from 6-&lt;12 years. similarly, in the previous paediatric study with introna plus rbv 67% of children were aged from 3-12, most of then being aged from 7-12 (64%).</p><p>in line with epidemiological data, vertical transmission was the primary mode of contamination in the 
 study patients (70%). median year since exposure was 8 years. in this study, 67% of patients were 
 infected with genotype g1 (74% of patients had g1 in p00321). in study p02538, the more difficult to 
 treat patients, i.e. g1 patients with high viral load, account for 29% of the study population. g2/3 account 
 for 28% of patients (of which 1/3 having high viral load g3).as a consequence of the problem of hcv-
 rna under-reporting, 7 patients with g3 and high viral load (hvl) were mistakenly assigned to receive 
 24 weeks of treatment instead of 48 weeks.</p><p>
 pre-therapy biopsies (performed at an unspecified time) were available for 99% of subjects. twelve 
 percent of patients had no fibrosis and the large majority of patients (82%) had minimal fibrosis (f1). 
 furthermore, most of the subjects had mild (44%) or moderate (30%) liver inflammation with only 18% 
 having severe inflammatory activity. no patients had cirrhosis in this study. biopsy results were similar 
 between both age groups. median alt was 0.87 uln in this study and 59% of patients had normal alt 
 level at baseline. overall, a large proportion of patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b plus rbv in this 
 study had only minimal hepatic disease. this is in line with the previous paediatric study with introna 
 plus rbv.</p></section><section><header>efficacy results</header><p>the primary analysis was to include all subjects who were assigned a subject number. the secondary analysis was to include all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. since all subjects 
 who were assigned a subject number received at least one dose of study medication, the secondary 
 efficacy analysis (all treated population) is identical to the intent-to-treat population.</p><p>
 primary endpoints: svr rates overall, 64.5% (69/107) of the subjects achieved svr. when carry-forward analysis was used, the svr rates were similar (65.4% [70/107]), since only one additional subject with genotype 1 (who had a rapid 
 virologic response and remained negative from tw 4 to fw 12) was considered a sustained “carry 
 forward” responder.</p></section><section><header>table 2 carry-forward sustained virologic response rates by genotype, age group, and assigned treatment duration</header><p>b: svr rate at follow-up week 24, n = 14/26 (53.8%). c: svr rate at follow-up week 24, n = 13/25 (52.0%). 
 d: svr rate at follow-up week 24, n = 43/80 (53.8%). 
 e: svr rate at follow-up week 24, n = 37/72 (51.4%).</p><p>svr rate were 72.5% in subjects aged 12 to 17 years and 61.2% in subjects ages 3 to 11 years.</p><p>however, when response rate is analyzed by genotype, no significant difference between both age groups is noticed. 
 these results highlight the fact that the genotype but not the age drives the response to bitherapy. in g1 
 9/22 medicinal product no longer authorised patients, svr rate was 52.8% after 48-w treatment, which is substantially higher than the response rate previously reported in g1 paediatric patients that received 48 weeks of introna plus rbv therapy in the 
 pivotal study p00321 (36%). although less striking, combination therapy with pegylated interferon plus 
 rbv enhances response rate when compared to combination therapy with standard interferon (93.3% vs 
 82%).</p><p>
 relapse rates subjects who had undetectable hcv-rna at the last treatment visit and detectable hcv-rna at the last follow-up visit were considered relapsers. among the 75 subjects who had undetectable hcv rna at the 
 end of study treatment, 5 relapsed (all had detectable hcv rna at fu week 4). therefore, the overall 
 relapse rate in the study was 6.7%. all 5 relapsers were female patients with g1. all had fibrosis grade f1. 
 of note, 4 /5 had &gt;80% adherence to ribavirin, pegintron and treatment duration. due to the small number 
 of relapsers, relationship between relapse rate and baseline characteristics are difficult to assess. however, 
 no relationship was apparent between relapse rate and baseline viral load, age or weight/body mass index 
 (bmi)/ body surface area (bsa).</p><p>svr by baseline demographics and disease characteristics sustained virologic response by baseline demographic data and disease characteristics is presented in the table 3 below:</p><p> 
 the svr rate in subjects with hcv genotype 1 was much higher in subjects with a baseline low viral 
 load (&lt;600,000 iu/ml) (71.8%) than in subjects with a baseline high viral load (≥600,000 iu/ml) (29%). 
 similarly, an additional analysis showed that the svr rate in g1 subjects with baseline viral load 
 &lt;400,000 iu/ml was notably higher than in subjects with baseline hcv-rna ≥ 400,000 iu/ml (82.8% 
 [24/29] vs 32.6% [14/43] including 2 subjects with missing baseline results). 
 10/22 medicinal product no longer authorised</p><p>furthermore, subjects with hcv genotype 1 who took ribavirin capsules had a higher svr rate compared with those who took oral solution (68.2% [15/22] vs. 46.0% [23/50], respectively).</p><p>
 in addition, predictors of svr were assessed using logistic regression analysis in logistic regression 
 models. hcv genotype, viral load and ribavirin form remain predictor of the response rate in multivariate 
 analysis as shown in table 4 below:</p><p>positive and negative predictive values for svr similarly to adults, tw12 and tw4 response were highly predictive of treatment response in g1 patient. in these difficult to treat patients, a svr rate as high as 88.9% was reported in g1 paediatric patients who 
 exhibited undetectable hcv rna at tw4. however, only 9/72 g1 patients achieved this early endpoint. 
 a larger proportion of g1 patients achieved tw12 undetectability (60%). in this subgroup, svr was 
 83.7%.</p><p>
 for genotypes 2, 3, and 4, the majority of subjects (29/35) attained evr and svr. in this group, the 
 response rate was also high (2/2) in subjects who became negative later in the study. 
 due to protocol-defined stopping rules, subject with &lt; 2 log drop at tw12 as compared to baseline were 
 to discontinue treatment at tw18. therefore, the negative predictive value of tw12 response is not 
 available for pegylated interferon plus rbv combination therapy in children. by extrapolation from the 
 nvp of tw12 response observed with standard interferon plus rbv in children, it is proposed to 
 recommend treatment discontinuation in g1 (and g4) patients if their tw12 hcv rna dropped &lt;2log10 
 compared to pre-treatment value or if they have detectable hcv rna at tw24.</p><p>alt response overall, normalisation of alt occurred in 77.3% (34/44) of subjects who had elevated alt at baseline. the alt normalisation was mostly associated with svr (79.4% [27/34]). seven subjects demonstrated 
 alt normalization without having attained svr.</p><p>
 11/22 medicinal product no longer authorised effect of adherence on svr subjects were considered adherent to the assigned treatment regimen if they received at least 80% of both peg2b and ribavirin doses (according to the assigned dosing regimen) for at least 80% of treatment 
 duration. if the subject’s dose was reduced by the investigator according to protocol-specified criteria and 
 the subject dosed according to the instructions given by the investigator, then the subject was considered 
 compliant with his/her drug therapy but non-adherent to the therapy.</p><p>
 per the predefined criterion, 71% (76/107) of subjects were considered at least 80% adherent to initially-
 assigned doses and duration. many subjects were considered nonadherent due to the protocol-specified 
 early discontinuation requirement for poor virologic response (treatment failure).</p><p>
 treatment adherence was similar in both age groups.</p><p>
 to further assess the effect of adherence on the svr rate in this study, 26 subjects who discontinued 
 treatment early (had &lt;80% of planned duration of therapy), were excluded from the analysis. the 
 remaining 81 subjects were at least 80% adherent to treatment duration. the dosing adherence of these 
 subjects was very high; thus a comparison based on dose adherence is not meaningful because of the high 
 proportion of subjects who received at least 80% of peg2b and ribavirin doses (93.8%; 76/81).</p><p>
 of note the 4 patients who had &lt; 80% adherence for peginterferon and/or ribavirin dose nevertheless 
 achieved svr in this study. adherence was similar for ribavirin in both age groups, suggesting patients 
 were similarly adherent to ribavirin oral solution and capsule.</p></section><section><header>discussion on the clinical efficacy</header><p>overall, the efficacy results from study p02538 show that, similarly to adults, use of combination therapy with pegylated interferon compared to combination therapy with standard interferon results in an 
 enhanced response rate.</p><p>an approximate 17% gain is obtained in children infected with g1 (achieving a 
 53% svr) and approx 14% for children infected with g2/3 (achieving a 93% svr). this gain appears 
 more marked as compared to adults (respectively of approx 9% and 3%).</p><p>furthermore, the levels of svr 
 achieved with pegifn plus ribavirin is higher in children as compared to adults (g1: around 50% vs 40%; 
 g2/3: around 90% vs 80%).</p><p>no difference in treatment response rate was observed between both age 
 groups (3-11 and 12-17 years of age).</p><p>
 similarly to adults, high baseline viral load in g1 patients was associated with a poor response to 
 treatment. forty- eight week treatment with pegylated interferon plus rbv in g1 patients having low viral 
 load defined as hcv rna &lt; 400 000 iu/ml allows to achieve</p><p>response rate as high as 82.8%, which is 
 close to the response rate obtained in g2/3 patients. of note, baseline viral load does not influence 
 response rate in genotype 2 and 3 patients.</p><p>
 in adult studies, it was shown that 41% of g1 patient with baseline low viral load (&lt;600 000 iu/ml) may 
 achieve rvr, allowing for a svr rate of 92% with an as short as 24 weeks treatment duration. the mah 
 did not explore different treatment durations for paediatric genotype 1 patients in study p02538. 
 however, the mah considered that extrapolation from adult data is acceptable given that children have 
 been shown to have a better response to bitherapy. it is noteworthy that in practice the reduction of 
 treatment duration might have to be discussed only in a marginal subgroup of paediatric patients given 
 that, as illustrated in study p02538, only 15% of g1 children with lvl achieved rvr. in order to better 
 appreciate to whether reduction of treatment duration might be proposed, the chmp requested that any 
 differences in the proportion of g1 patients achieving 4 weeks rvr between adults and paediatric patients 
 be discussed as this might represent a difference in the kinetics of viral load decrease/clearance making 
 the 4 weeks rvr less predictable in children than in adults. the mah has committed to provide a 
 response to this issue as a follow up commitment.</p><p>
 12/22 medicinal product no longer authorised due to protocol-defined stopping rules, subject with &lt; 2 log drop at tw12 as compared to baseline were to discontinue treatment at tw18. therefore, the negative predictive value of tw12 response is not 
 available for pegylated interferon plus rbv therapy.</p><p>however, by extrapolation from the nvp of tw12 
 response observed with standard interferon plus rbv in paediatric patients, it is proposed to recommend 
 treatment discontinuation in g1 (and g4) patients if their tw12 hcv rna dropped &lt;2log10 compared to 
 pre-treatment value or if they have detectable hcv rna at tw24.</p><p>lower response rates were consistently reported in patients treated with oral solution in each genotype 
 group with a marked difference in g1 patients: 68.2% of g1 patients that received rbv capsule had svr 
 versus 46% of g1 patients that received rbv oral solution. furthermore the pharmaceutical form of 
 ribavirin was found to be predictive of treatment response in univariate and multivariate logistic 
 regression analysis.</p><p>
 the chmp requested the mah to provide reassurance as regards the comparability of exposure between 
 children dosed with the ribavirin capsule and the oral solution. the mah provided a limited pk 
 assessment with data available from 5 children dosed with the capsule and 11 children dosed with the oral 
 solution. no significant difference in exposure was found between both formulations. nevertheless, it is 
 noteworthy that svr rates in children dosed with the oral solution was consistently lower than svr rates 
 in the capsule group. the mah considered this is due to an artefact of the small sample size. the 
 difference in svr seems striking in g1 children with hvl (svr capsule: 56% vs svr solution: 18%). 
 according to the mah this difference is driven by the unexplained poor response rate observed in the 
 hvl youngest children (3-5 years) where only 1 out of 8 patients achieved svr. if not explained by a 
 difference in the pk parameters in relation to the formulation, the lower response rate levels observed in 
 young children as compared to adolescents in this study might be explained by a difference in the 
 likelihood of response between both patient populations, related or non related to the disease, such as 
 difference in tolerance, or in compliance (driven by the acceptability of the oral solution).however based 
 on the available data the chmp concluded that</p><p>it is unlikely that tolerability/acceptability issue has 
 driven the virological failure in children treated with the oral solution.</p><p>in order to better address this issue the mah has committed to perform a</p><p>bioequivalence study of the oral 
 solution in relation to the capsules. an initial proposal has been made that raised some comments from the 
 chmp. the mah will revise the protocol in the frame of a follow up measure and specify the timelines 
 for study initiation and completion

 clinical safety</header><p>patient exposure</p><p>all safety assessments were based on data from all 107 enrolled subjects. all 27 subjects who were assigned to 24 weeks of treatment (hcv genotype 2 and low viral load hcv genotype 3) completed the 
 treatment with a mean treatment duration of 169 days. sixty-four percent (51/80) of subjects who were 
 assigned to 48 weeks of treatment (hcv genotype 1, 4, and high viral load hcv genotype 3) completed 
 the treatment, and 29 subjects discontinued the treatment mostly due to poor response to the treatment 
 (90%, 26/29), according to discontinuation stopping rules defined in the study protocol, with a mean 
 treatment duration of 273 days. only one subject discontinued due to an adverse event (ae). the overall 
 mean treatment duration was 247 (sd: 92) days in this study.</p><p>overall safety profile the overall safety profile of the peg2b plus ribavirin observed in this paediatric study is consistent with that observed in previous adult clinical studies and also in the paediatric population treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b plus ribavirin. no new safety issues were identified in this study. all patients experienced aes in 
 this study. however, very few patients presented serious aes and only 1 discontinued the study from aes. 
 furthermore, a slightly lower rate of dose modification due to ae was reported in this study when 
 compared to previous paediatric studies with interferon alfa-2b plus rbv.</p><p>13/22 medicinal product no longer authorised</p></section><section><header>table 5 summary of safety</header><p>common treatment-emergent aes the frequency and pattern of treatment-emergent adverse events are overall consistent with what has been reported in adults treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. as previously noted in paediatric 
 studies with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, abdominal pain 
 and vomiting were reported more frequently in children compared to adult patients. furthermore, 
 nervousness was also more frequently reported (8%) in this study.</p><p>
 the safety profile of peginterferon plus ribavirin combination in children is also similar to that reported 
 with interferon alfa-2b plus rbv combination in this population, with the exception of a lower rate of 
 psychiatric adverse events reported in pegylated interferon plus rbv treated children.</p><p>it is noteworthy that vomiting was reported in 48% of children aged 3-11 years but in 24% of children 
 aged 12-17 years. notably, a large majority of cases were reported in the first 12 weeks of treatment. 
 however, surprisingly, no difference in compliance between both ribavirin formulations was reported in 
 this study.</p><p>treatment-related aes the most prevalent treatment-related aes in all subjects were pyrexia (80%), headache (62%), neutropenia (33%), fatigue (30%), anorexia (29%), injection-site erythema (29%) and vomiting (27%):</p><p>
 severe adverse events (saes) the majority of treatment-related aes reported in this study were mild or moderate in severity. severe aes were reported in 8% (9/107) of all subjects: 10% (7/67) of subjects aged 3 to 11 years and 5% (2/40) 
 of subjects aged 12 to 17 years, as shown in table 10.</p></section><section><header>table 6 – severe adverse events</header><p>serious adverse events serious aes were reported in 3 subjects in the 12 to 17 years of age group; these events were considered by the investigator to be unlikely related to study drugs.</p><p>
 discontinuation of study and dose modification due to adverse events 14/22 medicinal product no longer authorised adverse event leading to discontinuation: thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation of study medication in one subject in the group 12 to 17 years of age (platelet count = 45 x 109/l) at week 42, considered 
 resolved on day 298). this subject attained svr.</p><p>
 adverse event leading to dose modification: reductions in the dose of one or both study medications were 
 permitted if necessary for the management of aes. while at the first reduced dose level, the subject was to 
 return for assessment at a minimum of every 2 weeks until the ae resolved or the subject was stable. if 
 further dose reduction was required, the second level of dose reduction was to be utilized. reduced doses 
 of peg2b and ribavirin are summarised in table 7 below:</p></section><section><header>table 7 reduced dose of peg2b and ribavirin</header><p>a total of 27 (25%) subjects modified their dose. the aes that most commonly led to dose modifications included anaemia (7%, 7/107) neutropenia (12%, 13/107), and weight loss (10%, 11/107). dose 
 modifications were more common in 12- to 17-year-old subjects (35%, 14/40) than in 3- to 11-year-old 
 subjects (19%, 13/67). neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt;0.75 x 109/l) was the most common ae that led to 
 peg2b dose modification. anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl) and weight loss were the most common aes 
 that led to ribavirin dose modifications.</p><p>
 dose-modification rate in this study was close to that observed in paediatric interferon alfa-2b plus 
 ribavirin studies, in which 31% (37/118) of subjects experienced dose modification and 6% (8/118) were 
 discontinued due to ae. fewer paediatric subjects needed dose modifications compared with adult 
 subjects receiving similar treatment. 43.3% (441/1019) of adult patients that received pegintron 
 1.5µg/kg+rbv (1000-1200mg/d) in the ideal study had dose reductions and 12.7% (129/1019) were 
 discontinued due to ae.</p><p>clinical laboratory findings most of the changes in laboratory values with peg2b plus ribavirin therapy were mild or moderate, as classified by modified who criteria. grade 3 decreases in neutrophil count occurred in 13% (8/107) of 
 subjects and grade 4 decreases in neutrophil count occurred in 3% (3/107) of subjects. occurrence of 
 grade 3/4 neutropenia did not correlate with occurrence of infectious disorders. grade 3 
 thrombocytopenia was reported for one subject in the 12- to 17-year-old group, which resulted in the only 
 discontinuation of study treatment due to an ae. grade 2 anaemia occurred in 2% (2/107) of subjects, the 
 remaining cases were all grade 1. the events of anaemia were managed through dose reductions. no 
 subject received growth factor (eg, erythropoietin) or required blood transfusion, and no subject 
 discontinued treatment because of anaemia.</p><p>
 haematologic aes were more common in 12- to 17-year-old subjects than in 3- to 11-year-old subjects, 
 possibly due to a better compensatory bone marrow function in 3- to 11-year-old subjects. furthermore, 
 grade 3 alt elevation was reported in 3% (3/107) of subjects.</p><p>
 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a similar frequency in children treated with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2b plus rbv when compared to children treated with standard interferon alfa-2b plus rbv. a better 
 haematological tolerance seems to be observed in children, notably as regards the rate of anaemia (38% of 
 grade 1 anaemia and 15% of grade 2 anaemia were reported in the ideal study).</p><p>adverse events associated with endocrine function (including thyroid related disorders) there were no cases of diabetes. treatment-emergent abnormalities in fasting glucose level were mild and transient in nature and included fasting glucose values slightly below or above normal reference range. 
 15/22 medicinal product no longer authorised</p><p>hypothyroidism was reported in three female subjects (3%, 3/107). five subjects, all females, received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism or elevated tsh.</p><p>
 tsh abnormalities at one or more visits during the treatment period, occurred in 23% (25/107) of 
 subjects: 28% (19/67) of subjects 3 to 11 years old and 15% (6/40) of subjects 12 to 17 years old. most of 
 these abnormalities (92%, 23/25) were tsh elevations above normal range; 16 subjects had only mild 
 tsh elevations (&lt;10 miu/l).</p><p>
 elevation of tsh occurred earlier in treatment in the younger children (3-11 years old) than in adolescents 
 (12-17 years old): elevated tsh was reported for five (8%) subjects at tw 12 and nine (16%) subjects at 
 tw 24, in contrast to the older group, in which only one (3%) subject had elevated tsh before tw 40. 
 female subjects were more likely to have clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism on peg2b treatment 
 compared with male subjects. at least one elevated tsh value was reported in 32% (18/56) of female 
 subjects and in 10% (5/52) of male subjects.</p><p>
 three female subjects had elevated tsh at the end of the follow-up period (fw 24) and stayed on

 overall the incidence of thyroid disorders in this study were similar to that reported in previous paediatric

 adults (hypothyroidism was reported in 5% of patients treated with peg2b 1.5 µg/kg/week plusrbv in 
 the ideal study).</p><p>psychiatric adverse events</p><p>twenty-eight percent (30/107) of subjects had at least one adverse event that is categorized under the body system/organ class of “psychiatric disorders.” psychiatric disorders were less frequent in subjects 
 aged 12 to 17 years (18%; 7/40) as compared to subjects aged 3 to 11 years (34%, 23/67). all aes within

 time points. percentile assignments were made using the 2000 standard growth charts developed by the 
 centres for disease control.</p><p>height</p><p> the mean change in height percentile from baseline to the end of treatment was -10.85 for subjects 3 to 11 years old and -2.5 for subjects 12 to 17 years old. the mean change in height percentiles from the end of

 treatment to end of 24 week follow-up, and baseline to end of 24 week follow-up. of the patients 
 receiving the longer duration of therapy, 31% (17/55) had a height percentile decrease to between 15 and 
 30 percentiles. in the shorter duration group, 8% (4/52) had a height percentile decrease of between 15 and 
 30 percentiles. a greater than 30 percentile decrease in height percentile was reported in 0 subjects in the 
 shorter treatment group and 4% (2/55) of the subjects in the longer treatment group.</p><p>
 weight the mean change in weight percentile from baseline to the end of treatment was -17.06 for subjects 3 to 11 years old and -12.8 for subjects 12 to 17 years old. the mean change in weight percentile from the end 
 of treatment to the end of follow-up was 12.68 for subjects 3 to 11 years old and 11.63 for subjects 12 to 
 17 years old. these data suggest that there was a compensatory, catch-up weight gain for affected subjects 
 after treatment ended. the mean last weight percentile for all subjects (53.39), including both age groups, 
 was slightly above the median.</p><p>growth velocity</p><p> mean growth velocity for the follow-up period (5.73 +/-4.10 cm/yr) was twice that for the treatment period (2.47 +/-2.22 cm/yr). the mean growth velocities in girls were slightly slower than those of boys in 
 both study periods. mean growth velocities for subjects &lt;11 years old were higher than those for subjects 
 ≥11 years old during both study periods. mean growth velocities are expected to be lower in subjects 
 whose growth had reached a plateau during the late teenage years.</p><p>
 to assess the impact of treatment on growth, the growth velocities during study treatment and follow-up 
 were compared to age- and sex-standardized norms for the us population; growth velocity percentiles 
 relative to these norms were determined. the mean growth velocity percentile for the treatment period 
 (9.43 +/-18.64) was below the median (50th percentile), but that for the 24-week follow-up (58.35 +/-
 41.12) was above the median, thus suggesting that some catch-up growth may have occurred after the end 
 of treatment.</p><p>inhibited growth (&lt;3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of subjects during the treatment phase of the 
 study. during the follow-up period, of those subjects who had clearly inhibited growth during treatment, 
 34.67% had faster than normal growth (&gt;97th percentile), 36% attained improved growth velocity (3rd to 
 97
 th percentile), and 20% continued to have inhibited growth (remained &lt;3rd percentile after stopping the treatment).</p><p>
 interim data from long term follow up study of pegylated interferon</p><p>interim data from the ongoing long term (5y) follow-up of children treated with the pegylated bitherapy show that</p><p>22 % (16/74) of children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 3 (4 %) 
 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment for more than 1 year. in particular, 
 17/22 medicinal product no longer authorised decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long term follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children.</p></section><section><header>discussion on the clinical safety</header><p>the overall safety profile of the peg2b plus ribavirin observed in this paediatric study is consistent with that observed in previous adult clinical studies and also in the paediatric population treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b plus ribavirin.</p><p> 
 with regards to psychiatric disorders,</p><p>whereas a concern about a higher rate of suicidal ideation/attempt in 
 children had been identified in previous paediatric studies with standard interferon alfa-2b plus rbv as 
 compared to adults (2.4% vs 1% in adults), no patient experienced such an event in this study. 
 furthermore, 51% of children/adolescent treated with interferon alfa-2b/rbv in previous paediatric 
 studies experienced psychiatric adverse events vs 28% in this study.</p><p>notably, a lower rate of depression is 
 reported in this study (2% of depression plus 2% of depressed mood, half of which being judged 
 treatment-related) when compared to previous paediatric studies with standard inf plus rbv (13%) or 
 when compared to adults (26% depression reported in the ideal study). of note, 3% of mood altered, 
 8% of nervousness and 3% of aggression were nevertheless reported in this study. although this study 
 demonstrated low incidence of psychiatric events, based on peg2b treatment experience in adults and 
 previous experience with interferon alfa-2b studies in a paediatric population, the risk of severe depression 
 and associated life-threatening events (such as suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt) cannot be ruled out. 
 all pediatric subjects must be closely monitored for psychiatric events throughout therapy and during 
 follow-up.</p><p>
 in line with the signal previously identified in children that received interferon alfa-2 plus rbv, a 
 significant impact of treatment on height and weight is again observed in this study.</p><p>
 whereas a compensatory catch up gain in weight seems to occur after treatment cessation, this is not the 
 case as regards height. mean decrease in height percentile from baseline to eot was -7.73 (-10.85 for 
 children aged 3-1, -2.5 for children aged 12-17) and mean change in height percentile from eot to eof 
 was only +1.11 (+2.03 for children aged 3-11 and -0.42 for children aged 12-17), reflecting that reversal 
 of the growth inhibition that occurred during treatment is largely incomplete at the end of the 24 week 
 follow-up period. in addition, the fact that children/adolescents aged 12-17 continue to experience 
 decrease in mean height percentile after treatment discontinuation further questions the reversibility of 
 growth inhibition due to combination therapy in paediatric patients.</p><p>
 twenty one out of one hundred and seven (20%) had &gt;15 percentiles decreases in height from baseline to 
 eot of which 7 (6.5% of total population) had &gt;30 percentiles decreases. these data are comparable to 
 observation from paediatric studies with standard interferon where 20/97 (21%) of children had &gt;15 
 percentiles decreases in height from baseline to eot of which 10 (10% of total population) had &gt;30 
 percentiles decreases. therefore, at equal treatment duration both standard and pegylated ifn impact</p><p>
 growth in the same way. at 6 months follow-up, 21.5% (23/107) of patients had &gt;15 percentiles decreases 
 in height between baseline and efu with 20% (21/107) of patients had &gt;15-&lt;30 percentiles decreases and 
 2% (2/107) had &gt;30 percentiles decreases. of note, according to the height for age percentile curves, a 15 
 percentiles decrease represents a difference of around 4 cm in height and a 30 percentiles decrease 
 represents a difference of around 6-10 cm in height. it is noteworthy that the proportion of patients with &gt; 
 15 percentiles decreases in height was substantially higher in patients treated with &gt;48 weeks of treatment 
 as compared to patients who received &lt;48 weeks of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin.</p><p>
 with regards to mean growth velocity a clear and significant growth inhibition of children due to the 
 bitherapy was</p><p>identified in this study, with as much as 70% of children having growth velocity falling to 
 &lt;3
 rd percentile during treatment (in previous paediatric study with introna plus rbv, 59% (57/97) of children had experienced &lt;3
 rd percentile decrease in growth velocity). even though a faster growth velocity was observed after treatment discontinuation in some children, it is noteworthy that 20% 
 18/22 medicinal product no longer authorised continued to have inhibited growth (remained &lt;3rd percentile) at the end of 24-week follow-up, which clearly show that growth spurts on cessation of treatment did not occur for a considerable proportion of 
 patients. for other children it was not specified whether they got back to their initial growth velocity.</p><p>
 overall and in line with the sag expert’s conclusions the chmp concluded that it cannot be ruled out 
 that the negative impact on growth of the bitherapy is irreversible. long-term safety data from 
 children/adolescents included in study p02538 are awaited to further characterise the long-term impact of 
 bitherapy on growth and sexual maturation. parental height collection and sexual maturation assessment 
 will be made to help to assess the effect of bitherapy on growth more precisely.</p><p>tsh levels and

 overall conclusion and benefit risk assessment</header><p>the mah applied for an extension of the indication for pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peginterferon/viraferonpeg) plus ribavirin (rebetol) in children from 3 years of age. as for adults, the 
 pegylated interferon is expected to improve convenience for patients (once weekly administration vs 3 
 times a week).</p><p>
 a single pivotal study (p02538) is submitted to support the paediatric extension. study p02538 is a phase 
 3/1b, open-label, multicenter study (including 10 sites in eu), where 107 pediatric subjects (two age 
 strata 3-11 n=67; 12-17 years of age, n=40) were all treated with peg2b plus ribavirin for up to 48 weeks 
 and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-treatment. the objectives of the part 1 of the study were to 
 assess the safety, the efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in naïve 
 pediatric patients with chronic hepatitis c. the second part of the study (long-term follow-up) has the 
 objectives to confirm durability of the virologic response and to characterize the long-term safety of the 
 combination, including growth and sexual maturation, in pediatric subjects. this 5 years long-term part of 
 the study is still ongoing.</p><p>
 of note, an extension of the indication for the combination therapy of rebetol with standard interferon 
 alfa-2b was granted in 2005 on the basis of data from a pivotal study having a similar design. by the time 
 the extension of indication of ifn plus ribavirin was granted in paediatric patients from 3 years of age the 
 safety profile of both agents (psychiatric adverse events, negative growth impact during treatment with 
 partial catch up at short term follow up) was a concern taking into account also the slowly progressive 
 disease in most children. the long-term growth data have added particular concerns to the initial 
 reservations against the early introduction of the bitherapy in childhood. indeed, based on the 5 years 
 growth data with the standard ifn and ribavirin, the chmp concluded that the reversibility of the marked 
 growth impact observed during treatment is uncertain. this was also the conclusion of the recent sag 
 expert meeting</p><p>
 although pegylated interferon is considered to have a clear therapeutic advantage over standard interferon 
 in terms of efficacy (like for adults) the safety signal of non reversible growth inhibition identified with 
 standard interferon raise the same safety concern on the use of the pegylated bitherapy in childhood.</p><p>the chmp agreed that the benefit/risk assessment in the paediatric population is particularly complex 
 since several factors have to be taken into account making each child an individual case.</p><p>factors related 
 to the disease such as likelihood of therapeutic response in terms of genotype, co-morbidities such as hiv-
 co-infection, and the histological evidence of disease progression, need to be taken into account as well as 
 factors that may be pejorative in terms of growth impact. as such it is recommended that the treatment is 
 initiated after the pubertal growth spurt i.e. once the adult height has been achieved. furthermore, the 
 threat of a growth alteration might be differently handled in a child according to the predicted adult height.</p><p>
 beyond existing objective criteria that might justify the early introduction of the bitherapy in childhood, 
 the psychosocial burden of a continuous replication in children constitutes a subjective factor that</p><p>
 influences the decision to treat children.</p><p>
 therefore the chmp agreed that the most reasonable attitude is to adequately warn prescribers and 
 patients about the safety concerns so that a well balanced decision can be taken whether to treat or not on 
 a case-by case basis. this is all the more reasonable that the benefit/risk assessment is multi-factorial (as 
 also discussed by the sag experts).</p><p>
 overall, the spc and pil contain the key issues to be considered in the decision making process for 
 treating paediatric patients, i.e. the decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis and the safety 
 20/22 medicinal product no longer authorised profile of the bitherapy should be carefully taken into account when deciding not to defer the treatment until adulthood.</p><p>
 in particular, it is important to consider that the bitherapy induced a growth inhibition of which 
 reversibility is currently uncertain. furthermore the disease characteristics of the child are also important 
 to be taken into account in this decision making process, i.e. evidence of disease progression notably 
 fibrosis, existence of co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease progression (such as hiv-
 co-infection), as well as prognostic factors for response, (hcv genotype and viral load).</p><p>overall, expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for 
 children and adolescents in the clinical trials. whenever possible the child should be treated after the 
 pubertal growth spurt. the mah will have to make particular efforts to adequately collect growth data in 
 the long term follow up of the pegylated ifn. the sag experts have indeed significantly questioned the 
 reliability of the mah approach (lack of standardisation of technique for taking measurement, lack of 
 collection of parental heights).</p><p>
 finally, the chmp considered the benefit/risk balance of pegylated ifn/ribavirin in children from 3 years 
 of age positive. the product information clearly highlights the factors that have to be taken into account in 
 the decision making process when not deferring the treatment until adulthood.
