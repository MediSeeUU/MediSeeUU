 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 7fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 8laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should 
 not be used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>
 pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment period.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued

 most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some 
 cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in 
 combination with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).</p><p>
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucination have 
 been reported rarely.</p><p> 11rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b, including pegintron, include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, renal insufficiency and renal 
 failure.</p><p>
 very rarely cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cardiac 
 ischaemia, myocardial infarction, sarcoidosis or exacerbation of sarcoidosis and injection site necrosis 
 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 12metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> 15 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 22fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 23laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be

 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 27metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> 30 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 37fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin

 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been

 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated

 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 42metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic

 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> 45 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 52fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 53laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should 
 not be used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>
 pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment period.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have 
 been reported rarely.</p><p> 56rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b, including pegintron, include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, renal insufficiency and renal

 very rarely cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cardiac 
 ischaemia, myocardial infarction, sarcoidosis or exacerbation of sarcoidosis and injection site necrosis 
 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 57metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 the negative predictive value for sustained response in patients treated with pegintron in monotherapy 
 was 98 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>59 pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate 
 to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> 60 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 67fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 68laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>there are no adequate data on the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. pegintron should 
 not be used during pregnancy (see</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p><p>
 pegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment period.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>: it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued 
 prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>
 ribavirin is teratogenic and embryocidal and must not be used in pregnant women (see ribavirin spc,</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the safety of pegintron is evaluated from data from two clinical trials: one with pegintron monotherapy, one with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. in both cases, patients were treated

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have

 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 72metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-
 related manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the 
 dose of pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors</header><p>: interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples 
 of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p> 75 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 82fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have 
 been reported rarely.</p><p> 86rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b, including pegintron, include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, renal insufficiency and renal

 very rarely cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cardiac 
 ischaemia, myocardial infarction, sarcoidosis or exacerbation of sarcoidosis and injection site necrosis 
 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 87metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate</p><p> 89to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration

 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which

 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 97fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 98laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have 
 been reported rarely.</p><p> 101rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b, including pegintron, include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, renal insufficiency and renal 
 failure.</p><p>
 very rarely cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cardiac 
 ischaemia, myocardial infarction, sarcoidosis or exacerbation of sarcoidosis and injection site necrosis 
 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 102metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 the negative predictive value for sustained response in patients treated with pegintron in monotherapy

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate</p><p> 104to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p> 105studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 112fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 113laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be

 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a

 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. following marketing, psychosis and hallucinations have 
 been reported rarely.</p><p> 116rarely reported events with interferon alfa-2b, including pegintron, include seizure, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, renal insufficiency and renal

 very rarely cases of erythema multiforme, stevens johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cardiac

 have been reported. ulcerative and ischaemic colitis have been reported very rarely with pegintron.</p><p>
 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated 
 with aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool 
 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 117metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate</p><p> 119to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p> 120studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 127fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin 
 to haart therapy (see ribavirin spc).</p><p>
 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased 
 rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection has also been reported.</p></section><section><header>other</header><p>: due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p></section><section><header>laboratory tests</header><p>: standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a 
 guideline prior to initiation of pegintron therapy are:</p><p>
 • platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 • neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 • tsh level must be within normal limits</p><p> 128laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>results of a single-dose study with pegintron demonstrated no effect on the activity of cytochrome (cy) p1a2, cyp2c8/9, cyp2d6, and hepatic cyp3a4 or n-acetyl transferase. caution should be 
 advised in the interpretation of these results as the use of other forms of interferon alpha result in 
 a 50 % reduction in the clearance and thus a doubling of plasma concentrations of theophylline, a 
 substrate of cyp1a2.</p><p>no pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between pegintron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose

 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 132metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay 
 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>).</p><p>
 in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens: 
 • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). 
 • interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).</p><p>
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.</p><p>
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
 ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 7</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 6</header><p>sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)</p></section><section><header>pegintron monotherapy pegintron + ribavirin

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate</p><p> 134to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p> 135studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. current 
 treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>acute hypersensitivity</header><p>: acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with pegintron, discontinue treatment and 
 institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>cardiovascular system</header><p>: as with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require 
 close monitoring. it is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have 
 electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily 
 supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron 
 therapy.</p></section><section><header>psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>: severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy. other cns 
 effects including aggressive behaviour, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed 
 with alpha interferon. if patients develop psychiatric or cns problems, including clinical depression, it is 
 recommended that the patient be carefully monitored due to the potential seriousness of these undesirable 
 effects. if symptoms persist or worsen, discontinue pegintron therapy.</p></section><section><header>liver function</header><p>: as with all interferons, discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.</p></section><section><header>fever</header><p>: while fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.</p></section><section><header>hydration</header><p>: adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. 
 fluid replacement may be necessary.</p></section><section><header>pulmonary changes</header><p>: pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in</p><p> 142fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows 
 pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be 
 monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon 
 alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of 
 pulmonary adverse events.</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disease</header><p>: the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of 
 autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with 
 autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon 
 therapy should be reassessed (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 thyroid changes</header><p>and</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>ocular changes</header><p>: ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons 
 (see</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8</header><p>). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye 
 examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, particularly in 
 patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
 discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening 
 ophthalmological disorders.</p></section><section><header>thyroid changes:</header><p>infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. determine thyroid 
 stimulating hormone (tsh) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms 
 consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron 
 treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.</p></section><section><header>metabolic disturbances</header><p>: hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.</p></section><section><header>hcv/hiv coinfection</header><p>patients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and ribavirin

 co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic 
 decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.</p></section><section><header>organ transplant recipients:</header><p>the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been 
 studied. preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased

 very rarely, interferon alfa-2b or pegintron used alone or in combination with ribavirin may be associated

 spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>).</p><p>
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies 
 including mononeuropathies (see also</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4</header><p>,</p></section><section><header>autoimmune disorders</header><p>).</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>in clinical trials, cases of accidental overdose, at never more than twice the prescribed dose, were reported. there were no serious reactions. undesirable effects resolved during continued administration of

 pegintron is a covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene 
 glycol. the average molecular weight of the molecule is approximately 31,300 daltons.</p></section><section><header>interferon alfa-2b</header><p>recombinant interferon alfa-2b is obtained from a clone of e. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.</p><p>
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.</p><p>
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.</p><p>
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell</p><p> 147metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.</p></section><section><header>pegintron</header><p>pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.</p></section><section><header>pegintron clinical trials</header><p>two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic

 (&gt; 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no 
 other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a

 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received

 is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate</p><p> 149to free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.</p><p>
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.</p><p>
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.</p><p>
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.</p><p>
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.</p></section><section><header>renal function</header><p>: renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.</p><p>
 based on these data, no dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance. however, 
 because of marked intra-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients be monitored closely during treatment with pegintron (see</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2</header><p>). patients with severe renal dysfunction or creatinine clearance 
 &lt; 50 ml/min must not be treated with pegintron.</p></section><section><header>hepatic function</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</p></section><section><header>elderly patients</header><p>≥</p></section><section><header n="65">65 years of age</header><p>: the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration 
 in pegintron dosage is necessary based on advancing age.</p></section><section><header>patients under the age of 18 years</header><p>: specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients. pegintron is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c only in 
 patients 18 years of age or older.</p></section><section><header>interferon neutralising factors:</header><p>interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which 
 neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who 
 received pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data 
  pegintron</header><p>: adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.</p><p>
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. pegintron showed no genotoxic potential. (see</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6</header><p>for relevant human data. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. therefore, nursing must be 
 discontinued prior to the initiation of therapy.)</p><p>
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity</p><p> 150studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.</p></section><section><header>pegintron plus ribavirin</header><p>: when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to self-inject pegintron at the end of the package leaflet).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution 
 is present. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take 
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>157tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or 
 pharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>
 check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the 
 way your heart beats; breathing problems, confusion; feeling depressed, wanting to harm yourself, 
 hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; convulsion (&quot;fit&quot;); trouble sleeping, thinking or 
 concentrating; severe stomach pain or cramps; blood or clots in stool (or black, tarry stool); fever or chills 
 beginning after a few weeks of treatment, pain in your lower back or side; difficulty or inability to pass 
 urine, painful or inflamed muscles (sometimes severe); problems with your eyes or your eyesight or 
 hearing; severe or painful reddening of your skin or mucous membrane, severe bleeding from your nose. 
 your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red 
 blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are 
 at acceptable levels.</p><p>
 the most common side effects with the combination of pegintron and ribavirin capsules are irritation 
 or redness at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, 
 weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose stools, stomach pain, vomiting, 
 muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, trouble falling asleep or 
 staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, hair loss, itching, 
 dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, rash, and dry mouth.</p><p>
 other common side effects that may occur with combination treatment are increased sweating, chest 
 pain, pain on the right side around your ribs, numbness, pain or tingling feeling, change in thyroid gland 
 activity (which may make you feel tired or, less commonly, energetic), stomach upset, rapid heart rate, 
 agitation, nervousness, difficult or irregular menstrual period.</p><p>
 less common are pain at the place of injection, flushing, low or high blood pressure, dry or teary eyes, 
 redness of skin or skin disorders, psoriasis, hives, nail disorder, feeling unwell, feeling faint, poor 
 coordination, confusion, increased or decreased sensitivity to touch, tense muscles, arthritis, bruising, 
 loss of interest in activities including sex, sexual problem, unusual dreams, shaky hands, vertigo (spinning 
 feeling), increased appetite, heartburn, intestinal gas (flatus), constipation, hemorrhoids, red or bleeding 
 gums, redness or sores in mouth, change in taste, changes in hearing or ringing in ears, thirst, aggressive or 
 changed behaviour, feeling sleepy, cold sores, fungal or bacterial infections, irritation of prostate gland, 
 increased need to pass urine, ear or respiratory infections, sinusitis, stuffy or runny nose, abnormal hair 
 texture, sensitivity to sunlight, migraine headache, eye pain or infection, blurred vision, puffy face, puffy 
 hands or feet, enlarged liver, problem affecting ovary or vagina, pain in breast, difficulty in speaking, 
 diabetes and swollen glands.</p><p>
 very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and 
 swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. check with your doctor immediately if 
 you have any of these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.</p><p>
 very rarely, pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia.</p><p>
 when pegintron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not 
 occurred at all.</p><p> 158if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. storing pegintron</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>

 inject pegintron. do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure 
 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p> 161slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p> 162</p></section><section><header>package leaflet   read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p> 169slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the

 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5

 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p> 185slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p> 186</p></section><section><header>package leaflet   read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.</header><p>- keep this leaflet. you may need to read it again.

 and requirement of self-injection.</p><p>
 preparation 
 collect necessary items before you begin: 
 -</p><p>a vial of pegintron powder for injection; 
 -</p><p>an ampoule of solvent for pegintron (water for injections); 
 -</p><p>a 1 ml syringe; 
 -</p><p>a long needle (for example 0.8 
 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial; 
 -</p><p>a short needle (for example 0.3 
 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; -</p><p>a cleansing swab. 
 wash your hands carefully.</p><p>
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection 
 before reconstitution, pegintron may appear either as a white, tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder. 
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial. clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
 you can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. remove the syringe from the 
 wrapping. do not touch the tip of the syringe. take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the 
 syringe. remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
 your hand. tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of 
 the ampoule. break off the top of the ampoule of solvent. insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and 
 withdraw the total amount of solvent.</p><p>
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 0.5 
 ml).</p><p>
 a small volume is lost during preparation of pegintron for injection and when the dose is measured and 
 injected. therefore, each vial contains an excess amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labelled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.</p><p>
 to prepare the pegintron solution, insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial and 
 gently place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial 
 with your hands. 
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly</header><p>, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. it is best not to aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or to inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a 
 greater amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not cause for concern.</p><p>
 to dissolve the entire contents, swirl the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the needle 
 and attached syringe in the vial.</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved. the contents should now be completely dissolved. stand the vial 
 upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. once the solution has 
 settled and all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a 
 small ring of tiny bubbles around the top. now you can withdraw your dose from the vial. use this 
 solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 
 hours.</p><p>
 measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injection 
 turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger</p><p> 193slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.</p><p>
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration or particulate matter is present. you are now ready to inject the dose.</p><p>
 injecting the solution 
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: 
 thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), 
 abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface 
 of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the plunger 
 very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not 
 inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by pushing the 
 plunger all the way down gently. 
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage. 
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the 
 syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p> 194</p></section><section><header>package leaflet

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution 
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take 
 it for as long as prescribed.</p><p> 207</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 your doctor has determined your dose of pegintron based on your weight. if necessary, the dose may 
 be changed during treatment.</p></section><section><header>combination treatment</header><p>pegintron, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram/kg once a week.</p><p>
 ribavirin capsules are taken every day, morning and evening. the number of ribavirin capsules you 
 take depends on your weight. 
 -</p><p>if you weigh less than 65 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening (total of 
 800 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, take 2 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total of 
 1,000 mg each day). 
 -</p><p>if you weigh more than 85 kg, take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 in the evening (total 
 1,200 mg each day).</p><p>
 the combination treatment is continued for at least 6 months, and sometimes for one year.</p></section><section><header>pegintron alone</header><p>: pegintron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at 
 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution 
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take 
 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p><p>217</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or 
 pharmacist if needed.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, pegintron can have side effects. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.</p><p>

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution 
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take 
 it for as long as prescribed.</p><p> 227</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year.</p></section><section><header>all patients</header><p>:</p><p>if you are injecting pegintron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is 
 clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.</p><p>
 if you have the impression that the effect of pegintron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection 
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be 
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration 
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).</p><p>
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the 
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution 
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard 
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.</p><p>
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will 
 help you not to forget to take it.</p><p>
 use pegintron exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take 
 it for as long as prescribed.</p><p> 237</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or
