 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.

 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.6</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 pegintron is intended for subcutaneous use. this means that it is injected through a short injection
 needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be
 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.

 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.36</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or

 instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration
 are provided with this leaflet (see how to use the pegintron pre-filled pen).
 prepare the dose just before you intend to inject it and use it immediately. look carefully at the
 reconstituted solution prior to administration. do not use if discolouration of the reconstituted solution
 is present. pegintron is intended for single use only. thus, after you give yourself the injection, discard
 the pegintron pre-filled pen with any solution that is left in it.
 inject pegintron once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will
 help you not to forget to take it.

 it for as long as prescribed.</p></section><section><header>if you use more pegintron than you should:</header><p>tell your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.46</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take pegintron:</header><p>take the dose as soon as you remember, then continue your treatment as usual.do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. contact your doctor or
