 there is no difference in dose between symptomatic and presymptomatic patients. 
 wilzin is available in hard capsules of 25 mg or 50 mg.</p><p>
  adults: the usual dose is 50 mg 3 times daily with a maximum dose of 50 mg 5 times daily. 
  children and adolescents: data are very limited in children under 6 years but since the disease is fully penetrant, 
 prophylactic treatment should be considered as early as possible. the recommended dose is as 
 follows: 
 - from 1 to 6 years: 25 mg twice daily 
 - from 6 to 16 years if bodyweight under 57 kg: 25 mg three times daily 
 - from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 50 mg three times daily. 
  pregnant women: a dose of 25 mg 3 times daily is usually effective but the dose should be adjusted to copper 
 levels (see section 4.4 and section 4.6).</p><p>
 in all cases, dose should be adjusted according to therapeutic monitoring (see section 4.4.).</p><p>
 wilzin must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. in case of 
 gastric intolerance, often occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be delayed to mid-morning, 
 between breakfast and lunch. it is also possible to take wilzin with a little protein, such as meat (see 
 section 4.5).</p><p>
 in children who are unable to swallow capsules, these should be opened and their content suspended in 
 a little water (possibly sugar or syrup flavoured water).</p><p>
 when switching a patient on chelating treatment to wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating 
 treatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for 
 3 the zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper 
 absorption. the administration of the chelating treatment and wilzin should be separated by at least 
 1 hour.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>zinc acetate dihydrate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of its slow onset of action. symptomatic patients must be initially treated with a chelating agent; once 
 copper levels are below toxic thresholds and patients are clinically stable, maintenance treatment with 
 wilzin can be considered. 
 nevertheless, while awaiting zinc induced duodenal metallothionein production and consequential 
 effective inhibition of copper absorption, zinc acetate dehydrate could be administered initially in 
 symptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent.</p><p>
 although rare, clinical deterioration may occur at the beginning of the treatment, as has also been 
 reported with chelating agents. whether this is related to mobilisation of copper stores or to natural 
 history of the disease remains unclear. a change of therapy is recommended in this situation.</p><p>
 caution should be exercised when switching patients with portal hypertension from a chelating agent 
 to wilzin, when such patients are doing well and the treatment is tolerated. two patients of a series of 
 16 died from hepatic decompensation and advanced portal hypertension after being changed from 
 penicillamine to zinc therapy.</p><p>
 therapeutic monitoring the aim of the treatment is to maintain the plasma free copper (also known as non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper) below 250 microgram/l (normal: 100-150 microgram/l) and the urinary copper 
 excretion below 125 microgram/24 h (normal: &lt; 50 microgram/24 h). the non-ceruloplasmin plasma 
 copper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, 
 given that each milligram of ceruloplasmin contains 3 micrograms of copper. 
 the urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of body loading with excess copper only 
 when patients are not on chelation therapy. urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation 
 therapy such as penicillamine or trientine. 
 the level of hepatic copper cannot be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between 
 potentially toxic free copper and metallothionein bound copper. 
 in treated patients, assays of urinary and/or plasma zinc may be a useful measure of treatment 
 compliance. values of urinary zinc above 2 mg/24 h and of plasma zinc above 1250 microgram/l 
 generally indicate adequate compliance.</p><p>
 like with all anti-copper agents overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is 
 especially harmful for children and pregnant women since copper is required for proper growth and 
 mental development. in these patient groups, urinary copper levels should be kept a little above the 
 upper limit of normal or in the high normal range (i.e. 40 – 50 microgram/24 h). 
 laboratory follow-up including haematological surveillance and lipoproteins determination should 
 also be performed in order to detect early manifestations of copper deficiency, such as anaemia and/or 
 leukopenia resulting from bone marrow depression, and decrease in hdl cholesterol and hdl/total 
 cholesterol ratio. 
 as copper deficiency may also cause myeloneuropathy, physicians should be alert to sensory and 
 motor symptoms and signs which may potentially indicate incipient neuropathy or myelopathy in 
 patients treated with wilzin.</p><p>
 4</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>other anti-copper agents pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in wilson’s disease patients on the combination of wilzin (50 mg three times daily) with ascorbic acid (1 g once daily), penicillamine (250 mg four times daily), 
 and trientine (250 mg four times daily). they showed no significant overall effect on copper balance 
 although mild interaction of zinc with chelators (penicillamine and trientine) could be detected with 
 decreased faecal but increased urinary copper excretion as compared with zinc alone. this is probably 
 due to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active 
 substances. 
 when switching a patient on chelating treatment to wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating 
 treatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for 
 the zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper 
 absorption. the administration of the chelating treatment and wilzin should be separated by at least 
 1 hour.</p><p>
 other medicinal products the absorption of zinc may be reduced by iron and calcium supplements, tetracyclines and phosphorus-containing compounds, while zinc may reduce the absorption of iron, tetracyclines, 
 fluoroquinolones.</p><p>
 food studies of the co-administration of zinc with food performed in healthy volunteers showed that the absorption of zinc was significantly delayed by many foods (including bread, hard boiled eggs, coffee 
 and milk). substances in food, especially phytates and fibres, bind zinc and prevent it from entering 
 the intestinal cells. however, protein appears to interfere the least.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies in patients with wilson’s disease give no indication of harmful effects of zinc on embryo/foetus and mother. five miscarriages and 2 birth defects 
 (microcephaly and correctable heart defect) were reported in 42 pregnancies.</p><p>
 animal studies conducted with different zinc salts do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects 
 with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development 
 (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 it is extremely important that pregnant wilson’s disease patients continue their therapy during 
 pregnancy. which treatment should be used, zinc or chelating agent should be decided by the 
 physician. dose adjustments to guarantee that the foetus will not become copper deficient must be 
 done and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 lactation zinc is excreted in human breast milk and zinc-induced copper deficiency in the breast-fed baby may occur. therefore, breast-feeding should be avoided during wilzin therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. 5 frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10),</p><p>uncommon

 common: blood amylase, lipase and alkaline phosphatase increased</p><p>
 anaemia may be micro-, normo- or macrocytic and is often associated with leukopenia. bone marrow 
 examination usually reveals characteristic &quot;ringed sideroblasts&quot; (i.e. developing red blood cells 
 containing iron-engorged paranuclear mitochondria). they may be early manifestations of copper 
 deficiency and may recover rapidly following reduction of zinc dosage. however, they must be 
 distinguished from haemolytic anaemia which commonly occurs where there is elevated serum free 
 copper in uncontrolled wilson’s disease.</p><p>
 the most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation. this is usually worst with the first morning 
 dose and disappears after the first days of treatment. delaying the first dose to mid-morning or taking 
 the dose with a little protein may usually relieve the symptoms.</p><p>
 elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase may occur after a few weeks of 
 treatment, with levels usually returning to high normal within the first one or two years of treatment.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v

 (40 times the proposed therapeutic dose) and was attributed to renal failure and haemorrhagic 
 pancreatitis with hyperglycaemic coma. the same dose did not produce any symptoms except for 
 vomiting in an adolescent who was treated by whole-bowel irrigation. another adolescent who 
 ingested 4 g of zinc had serum zinc level of about 50 mg/l 5 hours later and only experienced severe 
 nausea, vomiting and dizziness.</p><p>
 treatment of overdose should be with gastric lavage or induced emesis as quickly as possible to 
 remove unabsorbed zinc. heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if plasma zinc levels are 
 markedly elevated (&gt; 10 mg/l).</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: various alimentary tract and metabolism products, atc code: a16ax05. 6</p><p>
 wilson&apos;s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic 
 excretion of copper in the bile. copper accumulation in the liver leads to hepatocellular injury and 
 eventual cirrhosis. when the liver capacity of storing copper is exceeded copper is released into the 
 blood and is taken up in extra hepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders and 
 psychiatric manifestations. patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or 
 psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>
 the active moiety in zinc acetate dihydrate is zinc cation, which blocks the intestinal absorption of 
 copper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper. zinc induces the 
 production of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its 
 transfer into the blood. the bound copper is then eliminated in the stool following desquamation of the 
 intestinal cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic investigations of copper metabolism in patients with wilson’s disease included 
 determinations of net copper balance and radiolabelled copper uptake. a daily regimen of 150 mg of 
 wilzin in three administrations was shown to be effective in significantly reducing copper absorption 
 and inducing a negative copper balance.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>since the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, pharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc 
 bioavailability at the site of action.</p><p>
 zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at 
 increasing doses. fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake. it ranges from 30 
 to 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of 
 100 mg/d.</p><p>
 in the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder 
 being bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. the liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic 
 zinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc.</p><p>
 the plasma elimination half-life of zinc in healthy subjects is around 1 hour after a dose of 45 mg. the 
 elimination of zinc results primarily from faecal excretion with relatively little from urine and sweat. 
 the faecal excretion is in the greatest part due to the passage of unabsorbed zinc but it is also due to 
 endogenous intestinal secretion.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>preclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts. pharmacological and toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal 
 species. 
 the oral ld50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human 
 therapeutic dose). repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the noel (no observed effect 
 level) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose). 
 the weight of evidence, from 
 in vitro and in vivo tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant genotoxic activity. 
 reproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant 
 evidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity. 
 no conventional carcinogenicity study has been conducted with zinc acetate dihydrate.</p><p>

 and inducing a negative copper balance.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>since the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, pharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc 
 bioavailability at the site of action.</p><p>
 zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at 
 increasing doses. fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake. it ranges from 30 
 to 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of 
 100 mg/d.</p><p>
 in the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder 
 being bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. the liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic 
 zinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc.</p><p>
 the plasma elimination half-life of zinc in healthy subjects is around 1 hour after a dose of 45 mg. the 
 elimination of zinc results primarily from faecal excretion with relatively little from urine and sweat. 
 the faecal excretion is in the greatest part due to the passage of unabsorbed zinc but it is also due to 
 endogenous intestinal secretion.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>preclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts. pharmacological and toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal 
 species. 
 the oral ld50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human 
 therapeutic dose). repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the noel (no observed effect 
 level) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose). 
 the weight of evidence, from 
 in vitro and in vivo tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant genotoxic activity. 
 reproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant 
 evidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity. 
 no conventional carcinogenicity study has been conducted with zinc acetate dihydrate.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>capsule content 14 maize starch

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what wilzin is and what it is used for</header><p>wilzin belongs to a group of medicines called various alimentary tract and metabolism products.</p><p> 
 wilzin is indicated in the treatment of wilson’s disease, which is a rare inherited defect in copper 
 excretion. dietary copper, which cannot be properly eliminated, accumulates first in the liver, then in 
 other organs such as the eyes and the brain. this potentially leads to liver damage and neurological 
 disorders. 
 wilzin blocks the absorption of copper from the intestine thereby preventing its transfer into the blood 
 and its further accumulation in the body. unabsorbed copper is then eliminated in the stool.</p><p>
 wilson’s disease will persist during the entire lifetime of the patient and therefore the need for this 
 treatment is life-long.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you take wilzin 
  do not take wilzin</header><p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zinc or any of the other ingredients of wilzin.</p></section><section><header>take special care with wilzin</header><p>wilzin is usually not recommended for initial therapy of patients with signs and symptoms of wilson’s disease because of its slow onset of action.</p><p>
 if you are currently treated with another anti-copper agent, for example, penicillamine, your doctor 
 may add wilzin before stopping the initial treatment.</p><p>
 as with other anti-copper agents such as penicillamine, your symptoms may get worse after starting 
 the treatment. in this case, you must inform your doctor.</p><p>
 in order to follow up your condition and treatment your doctor will check your blood and urine on a 
 regular basis. this is to ensure that you receive sufficient treatment. monitoring may detect evidence 
 25 of insufficient treatment (copper excess) or excessive treatment (copper deficiency), both of which can 
 be harmful, particularly to growing children and pregnant women. 
 you should tell your doctor if you experience unusual muscle weakness or abnormal feeling in your 
 limbs as this may indicate excessive treatment.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines</header><p>please tell your doctor or your pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
 please consult your doctor before taking any other medicines which may reduce the effectiveness of 
 wilzin, such as iron, calcium supplements, tetracyclines (antibiotics) or phosphorus. conversely, the 
 effectiveness of some medicines, such as iron, tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones (antibiotics), may be 
 reduced by wilzin.</p></section><section><header>taking wilzin with food and drink</header><p>wilzin should be taken on an empty stomach, separated from mealtimes. dietary fibres and some dairy products, in particular, delay the absorption of zinc salts. some patients experience stomach upset after 
 the morning dose. please discuss the matter with your wilson’s disease doctor if this affects you. 
 this side effect may be reduced by postponing the first dose of the day until mid-morning (between 
 breakfast and the midday meal). it may also be minimised by taking the first dose of wilzin with a 
 small amount of protein-containing food, such as meat (but not milk).</p></section><section><header>pregnancy</header><p>please consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. it is very important to continue anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. 
 if you become pregnant during therapy with wilzin, your doctor will decide which treatment and 
 which dose is best in your situation.</p></section><section><header>breast-feeding</header><p>breast-feeding should be avoided if you are on wilzin therapy. please discuss with your doctor.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of wilzin</header><p>wilzin 50 mg hard capsules contains sunset yellow fcf (e110) which may cause allergic reactions.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to take wilzin</header><p>always take wilzin exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. for the different dose regimens wilzin is available in hard capsules of 
 25 mg or 50 mg.</p><p>
  for adults: the usual dose is 1 hard capsule of wilzin 50 mg (or 2 hard capsules of wilzin 25 mg) three times 
 daily with a maximum dose of 1 hard capsule of wilzin 50 mg (or 2 hard capsules of 
 wilzin 25 mg) five times daily. 
  for children and adolescents: the usual dose is:</p><p>- from 1 to 6 years: 1 hard capsule of wilzin 25 mg twice daily</p><p>- from 6 to 16 years if bodyweight under 57 kg: 1 hard capsule of wilzin 25 mg three times 
 daily</p><p>- from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 2 hard capsules of wilzin 25 mg or 1 hard 
 capsule of wilzin 50 mg three times daily.</p><p>
 always take wilzin on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. 
 26 if the morning dose is not well tolerated (see section 4) it is possible to delay it to mid-morning, 
 between breakfast and lunch. it is also possible to take wilzin with a little protein, such as meat.</p><p>
 if you have been prescribed wilzin with another anti-copper agent, such as penicillamine, keep an 
 interval of at least 1 hour between the two medicines.</p><p>
 to administer wilzin to children who are unable to swallow capsules, open the capsule and mix the 
 powder with a little water (possibly flavoured with sugar or syrup).</p></section><section><header>if you take more wilzin than you should:</header><p>if you take more wilzin than prescribed, you may experience nausea, vomiting and dizziness. in this case you must ask your doctor for advice.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take wilzin:</header><p>do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose.</p><p>
 if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, wilzin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them..</p><p> 
 these side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows:</p><p>
  very common: affects more than 1 user in 10</p><p> common:</p><p>
 affects 1 to 10 users in 100 
  uncommon:</p><p>affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000 
  rare:</p><p> 
 affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000 
  very rare:</p><p>
 affects less than 1 user in 10,000 
  not known:</p><p>frequency cannot be estimated from the available data.</p><p>
 common:</p><p> after wilzin intake, gastric irritation may occur, especially at the beginning of treatment.  changes in blood tests have been reported, including an increase in some liver and pancreatic enzymes.</p><p>
 uncommon:</p><p> a decrease in blood red and white cells may occur.</p></section><section><header>reporting of side effects</header><p>if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
 this includes any possible side effects 
 not listed in this leaflet.</p><p>you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v
 . by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
 this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. how to store wilzin</header><p> keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>
