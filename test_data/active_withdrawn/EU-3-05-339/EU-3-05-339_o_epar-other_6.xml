 chronic phase cml.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention</header><p>cml is relatively rare in both adults and children, with rates increasing with increased age; rates peak in the age range of 65-74 years. the incidence of the disease in paediatric patients increases in teen 
 years: cml constitutes 2% of all leukemias in children younger than 15 years and 9% of all leukemias 
 in adolescents between 15 and 19 years, with an annual incidence of 1 and 2.2 cases per million in 
 these two age groups, respectively. an estimated 12-14% of paediatric and young adult patients die 
 within 5 years of cml diagnosis. overall, the genetic basis and course of disease is similar in adult and 
 paediatric cml patients. children and adolescents tend to have a more aggressive clinical presentation 
 than older adults, although the impact of this feature on progression and response to treatment in 
 paediatric patients remains unknown. 
 exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor. while there is no known familial disposition 
 to cml, rare families in which multiple members develop mpns, including cml, have been described.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 aetiology and pathogenesis</header><p>chronic myeloid leukemia is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm derived from an abnormal multipotent hematopoietic stem cell that has acquired the bcr-abl1 fusion gene, usually through 
 t(9;22)(q34;q11), also known as the philadelphia chromosome. the development of chronic phase cml 
 appears to be a direct result of bcr-abl1 activity, which promotes its development by allowing: 
 uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells; discordant maturation; escape from apoptosis; altered 
 interaction with the cellular matrix.</p><p>
 the progression of cml from chronic phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis is a complex, multistep 
 process, but also appears to involve the constitutive expression of the bcr-abl1 tyrosine kinase.</p><p>
 the following events appear to be necessary for the transformation of chronic phase cml into an acute 
 phase of disease: constitutive expression of the bcr-abl1 tyrosine kinase; differentiation arrest; 
 genetic instability and additional chromosomal abnormalities; inactivation of tumor suppressor genes</p><p>
 mouse models have provided support for bcr-abl1 as the principal cause of these malignancies and 
 have allowed for the in vivo study of bcr-abl1 signaling, identification of novel genes involved in cml 
 development, and testing of potential therapies.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.  
 clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>cml has a triphasic or biphasic clinical course: a chronic phase, which is present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 85 percent of patients; an accelerated phase, in which neutrophil</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/302652/2018</p><p>
 page 8/82 
 differentiation becomes progressively impaired and leukocyte counts are more difficult to control with treatment; and blast crisis, a condition resembling acute leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts 
 proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. 
 the clinical findings at diagnosis of cml vary among reported series and also depend upon the stage of 
 disease at diagnosis. twenty to 50 percent of patients are asymptomatic, with the disease first being 
 suspected from routine blood tests. among symptomatic patients, systemic symptoms such as fatigue, 
 malaise, weight loss, excessive sweating, abdominal fullness and bleeding episodes due to platelet 
 dysfunction are common. 
 abdominal pain and discomfort may include left upper quadrant pain (sometimes referred to the left 
 shoulder) and early satiety, due to the enlarged spleen with or without peri-splenitis and/or splenic 
 infarction. tenderness over the lower sternum, due to an expanding bone marrow, is sometimes seen. 
 acute gouty arthritis may also present at this time, due to overproduction of uric acid.</p><p>
 other frequent findings include splenomegaly, anemia, white blood cell count above 100,000/microl 
 and platelet count above 600,000 to 700,000/microl. involvement of extramedullary tissues such as 
 the lymph nodes, skin, and soft tissues is generally limited to patients with blast crisis. 
 the peripheral smear typically demonstrates a leukocytosis with a median white count of 
 approximately 100,000/microl. the white blood cell differential typically shows virtually all cells of the 
 neutrophilic series, from myeloblasts to mature neutrophils with peaks in the percent myelocytes and 
 segmented neutrophils. blasts typically account for less than 2 percent. the presence of a greater 
 percent of myelocytes than the more mature metamyelocytes (&quot;leukemic hiatus&quot; or &quot;myelocyte bulge&quot;) 
 is one of the classic findings in cml. the granulocytes of chronic phase are morphologically normal 
 with no evidence of dysplasia, but dysplasia can develop in more advanced disease, and particularly in 
 accelerated phase. 
 bone marrow aspiration and biopsy demonstrates granulocytic hyperplasia with a maturation pattern 
 that reflects that seen in the peripheral smear. other non-specific bone marrow findings include an 
 increase in reticulin fibrosis and vascularity. 
 the peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate differential count are key components of determining 
 the disease stage. in general, peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts between 10 and 19 percent are 
 diagnostic of accelerated phase disease, while blasts over 20 percent are diagnostic of blast crisis.</p><p>
 the vast majority of patients (90% to 95%) demonstrate the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) reciprocal 
 translocation that results in the ph chromosome. 
 various scoring systems have also been devised in an attempt to predict disease outcome. while the 
 sokal and euro (hasford) scores were developed prior to the discovery of imatinib, the eutos score 
 was developed and validated using data from 2060 patients enrolled in prospective studies of imatinib 
 and is intended to be a better predictor of clinical responses to that drug. high-risk patients defined by 
 this scoring system have a one in three chance of failing to respond to imatinib.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header><p>in the eu (european union), imatinib (glivec) is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (ph+) chronic myeloid 
 leukaemia (cml) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of 
 treatment; adult and paediatric patients with ph+ cml in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha

 philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ph+ all) integrated with chemotherapy. 
 in addition, tasigna was approved for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
 philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) in the chronic phase and 
 paediatric patients with chronic phase philadelphia chromosome positive cml with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.</p><p>
 there is a high unmet medical need for approved therapies that can improve responses in paediatric 
 patients with cml-cp who received imatinib as first-line treatment. approximately 10% to 30% of 
 adult and paediatric patients with cml-cp discontinue from imatinib due to declining response to 
 treatment, progression of disease, or intolerance of adverse drug effects. options are also needed for 
 newly-diagnosed subjects and before considering hsct. paediatric patients with no suitable donor for 
 hsct have an even more critical unmet need for disease management.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>dasatinib inhibits the activity of the bcr abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and pdgfβ receptor.

 finished medicinal product</header></section><section><header>description of the product and pharmaceutical development</header><p>the finished product is a powder for oral suspension (pfos) containing 0.99 g (10 mg/ml after constitution) of the active substance. 
 in accordance with the pip which includes the requirement of an age-appropriate formulation, the 
 marketing authorisation holder has formulated a taste-optimized oral suspension product (powder for 
 oral suspension). the goal of the development of the powder for oral suspension was to provide a 
 stable, palatable, and dose uniform suspension at a concentration of 10 mg/ml upon constitution with 
 water. in the selection of formulations for evaluation, consideration was given to the preferred dosage 
 forms as outlined in the ema reflection paper, formulations of choice for the paediatric population. 
 solution and suspension formulations were considered to be preferable over other dosage forms such 
 as powders or chewable tablets in the targeted age group of 1 to 6 years, since they are most 
 acceptable for children who are not yet able to chew or swallow and they provide for greater flexibility 
 in delivering variable doses. feasibility of different formulation approaches were evaluated, including a 
 ready to-use solution and powder for oral solution, however, these formulation approaches were not 
 pursued due to limited solubility of dasatinib in the vehicles and taste-masking challenges.</p><p>
 the powder will be constituted with water at the pharmacy and provided to the patient as a multi-dose 
 product presentation with press-in-bottle adaptor and oral dosing syringe. 
 the active substance used is the crystalline monohydrate form, which is the same as that used in the 
 marketed film-coated tablets
 . quality risk assessments and experiments were performed to understand the compositional requirements for a robust formulation and the impact of manufacturing</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 process parameters on the identified critical quality attributes (cqas). several commonly used excipients for powder for oral solution/suspension were evaluated as binary mixtures (with or without 
 water) for compatibility with dasatinib. the levels of individual and total impurities were monitored. 
 dasatinib was prone to significant degradation in the presence of certain excipients. all excipients are 
 well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with ph. eur. standards with the 
 exception of mixed berry flavour. all flavour ingredients contained in the mixed berry flavour are 
 recognized as safe (gras). in addition, the constituents of the mixed berry flavour are listed in the eu 
 list of flavouring substances as defined by regulation eu 872/2012. there are no novel excipients used 
 in the finished product formulation. the list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the smpc and in 
 paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.</p><p>
 formulation development studies were performed to select the type and level of the excipients for a 
 palatable formulation, which, when constituted with water, would be easily dispersed and dispensed by 
 the patient/care giver using the supplied oral dosing syringe.</p><p>
 during formulation development palatability and taste, selection of sweetener, selection of ph/buffer 
 system, suspending agents, preservation system (and level), antifoaming agent, flavouring agent, 
 constitution time and re-dispersibility time, and particle size were studied. characteristics such as the 
 ph solubility/stability profile of the active substance, chemical compatibility, and taste led to the use of 
 the tartrate-based buffer system at a ph where the selected preservative is effective. other excipients 
 providing desired product profile performance and manufacturability were selected for evaluation 
 based on the drug-excipient compatibility study and the amount required was confirmed during the 
 development studies.</p><p>
 formulation comparability studies were provided.</p><p>an open-label crossover bioequivalence (be) study 
 was conducted in fasted adult healthy subjects to compare the bioavailability of reference tablets, 
 dasatinib pfos and dispersed tablets 
 the applicant has applied qbd principles in the development of the finished product. however, no 
 design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product 
 the proposed commercial manufacturing process was designed to consistently meet the identified 
 finished product critical quality attributes (cqas). risk assessments were performed at multiple stages 
 throughout development to guide development studies and to establish the control strategy for the 
 commercial 
 manufacturing 
 process. 
 the 
 process 
 development 
 studies 
 evaluated 
 different 
 manufacturing process parameters to determine the effect on selected product attributes. the powder 
 blend is manufactured using a series of milling and blending steps followed by filling of the final powder 
 blend into bottles. initial selection of the processing steps and parameters was based upon prior 
 knowledge and experiences gained from other powder finished products. 
 manufacturing process risk assessments throughout process development to determine the potential 
 failure modes associated with the manufacturing process and to quantify the level of risk to the 
 product quality attributes were employed. the risk assessments are used to guide the design of the 
 process development studies so that appropriate controls and/or mitigation measures can be identified 
 and implemented to minimize the risk to an acceptable level. for the proposed commercial process, 
 process risk assessments using failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) were conducted to identify the 
 level of risk in the manufacturing process 
 dasatinib pfos is supplied in a 120 ml high density polyethylene bottle (with polypropylene child-
 resistant closure). each pack also contains a low density polyethylene press-in-bottle adapter (piba) 
 and a 12-ml oral dosing syringe (polypropylene syringe barrel with high density polyethylene syringe

 validation batches will be processed according to an approved manufacturing batch record and per an 
 approved process validation protocol. during the validation study, process steps will be monitored and 
 the results will be documented in a process validation report. the manufacturing process of the 
 product is considered as standard process, therefore, it is accepted that only the validation protocol 
 suffices and that no actual process validation is provided in the dossier. 
 it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
 of intended quality in a reproducible manner. the in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
 manufacturing process.</p></section><section><header>product specification</header><p>the finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description of powder (visual), description of suspension (visual), identification (hplc, raman, ir-
 atr), assay (hplc), impurities/degradants (hplc), dissolution (hplc), uniformity of mass (ph eur), 
 ph, sodium benzoate (hplc) and microbial limits (tamc, tymc, 
 escherichia coli). the analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
 accordance with the ich guidelines. the reference standard used in the analysis of the finished product 
 is the same as used for the active substance. satisfactory information regarding the reference 
 standards used has been presented. 
 batch analysis results are provided for 8 commercial batches confirming the consistency of the 
 manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
 the finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
 traditional final product release testing.</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5 °c, 25 °c / 60% rh, and</p><p>30 °c / 75%rh ) and for up to 6 months under 
 accelerated conditions (40 °c / 75% rh) according to the ich guidelines were provided. the batches 
 of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
 packaging proposed for marketing.</p><p>
 samples were tested for appearance, appearance of the suspension, assay, impurities, sodium 
 benzoate, dissolution, water content, ph, constitution time, identity and microbial limits (tamc, tymc, 
 escherichia coli). the analytical procedures used are stability indicating. the finished product shows little or no change in long term stability studies. all results meet the 
 proposed acceptance criteria. in addition, stress stability studies (-20°c, 50°c, open bottle, and</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 freeze/thaw temperature cycling) were performed in one batch.</p><p>all results meet the proposed acceptance criteria. 
 one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ich guideline on photostability testing of new drug 
 substances and products. the photostability study results indicate that the product does not need to 
 be protected from light. 
 in-use constitution studies were performed in 3 batches at the initial and 12 month time points. 
 finished product bottles were constituted with purified water, and stored for</p><p>up to 2 months at 5 °c, 
 30 °c/75% rh, and for 1 month at 40°c/75%rh (initial time point only) and then tested. there was 
 essentially little to no change observed and all results met the proposed acceptance criteria.</p><p>
 in-use studies were also performed in 3 batches at the initial and 12 month time points for constituted 
 finished product. bottles were constituted with water and stored at 5°c and 30°c/75%rh. the 
 individual bottles were tested at initial and 30 days. there was essentially little to no change observed. 
 the test results for both the initial and 12-month in-use studies remained essentially unchanged when 
 compared with the zero-time values at the initial use-time studies. 
 food mixing studies were performed on the pfos at initial and at 9 months (stored at 30 °c/75% rh) 
 using 4 different vehicles for mixing with the constituted dasatinib pfos, 10 mg/ml. the constituted 
 suspension was first stored for 2 months (60 days) at 30 °c/75% rh, then 2 ml of the constituted 
 suspension was mixed with 15 grams of liquid or food/vehicle, and stored for up to 2 hours at 
 30 °c/75% rh and then tested. there was essentially little to no change observed in assay (% of 
 initial), impurities, and dissolution for suspension mixed with food/liquid through 2 hours of storage at 
 30 °c/75% rh. results remained essentially unchanged at the initial and 9-month time points. 
 based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of the power is of 24 months stored bellow 
 25 °c , after constitution, the oral suspension is stable for 60 days when stored in a refrigerator (2 °c 
 – to 8 °c) and do not freeze as stated in the smpc (section 6.3) are acceptable. constituted oral 
 suspension may be mixed with milk, yogurt, apple juice, or apple sauce and may be stored at or below 
 25 °c for up to 1 hour.</p></section><section><header>adventitious agents</header><p>sucrose is the only specified risk material of animal origin, used as an excipient in the finished product. in the processing of sucrose, the manufacturer uses animal bone-charcoal as a filtering agent to

 the ppk analysis using pooled data from paediatric clinical studies was conducted to characterize 
 dasatinib pk in paediatric subjects, and to quantify the differences in exposure produced by 72 mg/m
 2 pfos, relative to 60 mg/ m2 tablet. the effect of formulation on dasatinib pk showed that the bioavailability of pfos was approximately 40% lower than that of the tablet formulation in paediatric 
 subjects. the bioavailability of pfos (fr) was 64.4% (95% ci 47.3% -87.8%) of the intact tablet, and 
 the absorption rate (ka) was 120% (95% ci 67.5% -215%) of the tablet although with wide ci which 
 also crossed 1.

 specifically, the mixed berry-flavoured pfos formulation was selected for further development, based 
 on the results of assessing the taste properties of api prototype powder for oral solution (pos) and 
 pfos formulations. the dasatinib pfos exhibited good flavour stability one-year and two-year post 
 manufacture, both freshly constituted and after 30 and 60 days of room temperature storage.</p><p>
 in the be study ca180352, healthy adult subjects were asked to evaluate the immediate taste (within 
 the first 10 seconds) and the aftertaste (after 1 minute) of the pfos using the palatability assessment,

 years have been collected -which is adequate to characterize the pk in this population- with leukaemia 
 or solid tumours (72 who received the tablet formulation and 32 who received the powder for oral 
 suspension). 
 pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of dasatinib were evaluated for 72 paediatric patients with 
 relapsed or refractory leukaemia or solid tumours at oral doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/m
 2 once daily and 50 to 110 mg/m
 2 twice daily. data was pooled across two studies and showed that dasatinib</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/302652/2018</p><p>
 page 28/82 
 was rapidly absorbed. mean tmax was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours and mean half-life ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. dasatinib pk showed dose proportionality with 
 a dose-related increase in exposure observed in paediatric patients. there was no significant difference 
 of dasatinib pk between children and adolescents. the geometric means of dose-normalized dasatinib 
 c
 max, auc (0-t), and auc (inf) appeared to be similar between children and adolescents at different dose levels. a ppk model-based simulation predicted that the body weight tiered dosing 
 recommendation described for the tablet, in section 4.2, is expected to provide similar exposure to a 
 tablet dose of 60 mg/m
 2. these data should be considered if patients are to switch from tablets to powder for oral suspension or vice versa. 
 the pk characteristics of dasatinib appear to be similar in paediatric and adult subjects, and also in the 
 three investigated paediatric age groups, infant/toddlers, children and adolescents. data are limited in 
 children below the age of 2 years and/or &lt; 10 kg, but suggest a lower exposure for the youngest 
 children.</p><p>
 with no evidence of impact on efficacy for the lower exposure, it is acceptable not to recommend a 
 higher dose in the youngest children. no effect of disease type has been identified. clearance and 
 volume of distribution increase with increase in weight, supporting the bsa-based dosing in paediatric 
 subjects. inter-subject variability was considerable in children (48.4 %), but similar to that in adults 
 (44.4 %)</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>dasatinib was measured in csf 4 hours post dose with a ratio of 1- 5 %. data are limited, but dasatinib distribution to cns appears to be higher in children than in adults. 
 ppk analysis has showed similar exposure (c
 avgss, cminss, cmaxss) between the 60 mg/m2 dose of the tablets in paediatric subjects and the adult dose of 100 mg qd. the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet dose is considered the reference dose in paediatric subjects.</p><p>
 an age appropriate formulation has been developed for paediatric subjects incapable of/unwilling to 
 swallow tablets. bioequivalence between the pfos, dispersed tablets in orange juice and intact tablets 
 has been investigated in a bioequivalence study in healthy adult subjects. the pfos and the dispersed 
 tablets were not bioequivalent to the reference tablets. in adults, auc
 inf was 19 % lower for pfos and dispersed tablets had a 16 % lower auc
 inf compared to intact tablets. this led to a pfos dose used in cohort 3b in study ca180226 of 72 mg/m
 2. ppk model-based simulations assessed exposure of pfos in paediatric subjects, and this showed an even lower exposure of pfos in paediatric subjects, namely 
 40 % lower. a shorter gastric transit time, investigated with a pbpk model, is a plausible explanation for the lower exposure of both pfos and dispersed tablets. simulations has</p><p>predicted a pfos dose of 
 90 mg/m2 to provide similar exposure to the 60 mg/m2 tablet dose for both cavgss, cmin and cmax. the proposed paediatric pfos dose is therefore 90 mg/m
 2. the applicant has suggested a post-marketing pk “window-study” to evaluate the proposed 90 mg/m
 2 dose.</p><p> food has an effect on tablet absorption in adults with reduced c
 max and higher auc, but with negligible clinical relevance. this also applies to paediatric subjects, when investigated with pbpk simulations.</p><p>
 a weight-tiered approach has been investigated for both pfos and tablets, and the simulations predict 
 similar exposure to the 60 mg/m
 2 dose in paediatric subjects.</p><p>the palatability of the pfos has been assessed to be “fair” in both adult and paediatric subjects with 
 some variability, and the flavour is stable for up to two years after manufacture.</p><p>
 overall, the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib have been investigated in a substantial number of paediatric 
 subjects, and no major issues has been identified. the use of ppk and pbpk model based simulations 
 to investigate exposure, bioequivalence and food effect in this rare target population is supported. the 
 models have been found to be adequate and suitable for the purposes. the genetic basis and course of 
 ph+ cml-cp is similar in adult and paediatric patients. a similar exposure-response to dasatinib in</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/302652/2018</p><p>

 paediatric subjects compared to adults will support extrapolation of adult efficacy data in the proposed indication. 
 dose-response and exposure response analysis have been conducted with data from the phase ii 
 studythe</p><p>ca180226 in 84 paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed (treatment naïve) cml-cp. dose-
 response and exposure-response has been explored for two efficacy-endpoints used in cml-cp: mmr 
 and bcr-abl. only few patients had dispersed tablets and no effect on d-r or e-r analysis is 
 expected.</p><p>
 no statistically significant relationship was identified between dasatinib dosage form/exposure and 
 efficacy with the dose range of 60 mg/m
 2 tablet to 72 mg/m2 pfos, however, there was a trend of increased mmr probability and faster decline of bcr-abl transcript levels with increasing dasatinib 
 exposure measured by c
 avgss. this support the proposed increase in pfos dose from 72 mg/m2 to 90 mg/m
 2 to match the exposure of 60 mg/m2 tablets more closely. no change in safety issues can be expected with the proposed higher pfos dose. 
 pfos is proposed indicated to pediatric subjects and adult patients with cml who cannot swallow 
 tablets. weight tiered doses have been suggested taking into account the lower bioavailability. 
 pediatric and adults patients &gt; 45 kg are likely to have similar physiology and for patients &gt; 45 kg 
 pfos dose of 120 mg is proposed in line with the findings in the adult be study.</p><p>
 further, it is agreed that the very low bioavailability of dasatinib following suspension administration is 
 not unique to the suspension formulation, but is also observed with the dispersed tablets in adults. 
 effect of food on the bioavailability and variability of dasatinib for the suspension has not been 
 investigated clinically, but the high intra-subject variability might be related to physiological variability 
 in gastric ph and gastric transit time, administration under fed condition might be preferable as this 
 reduces the variability for the tablets.</p><p>
 the proposed pfos dose of 90 mg/m
 2 is based on simulations, which appear to be justified and acceptable, however, confirmation from clinical data is needed. a pk “window” study has been agreed 
 with a finalized csr in 1q 2020. a wt-tiered dosing approach likely to ease daily dosing has been 
 proposed and appears to provide similar exposure with acceptable differences to the tablet reference

 tablet – proposed dose 60 mg/m2 in study ca180018, across the pre-specified dose levels of 60 to 120 mg/ m2 qd, no maximum tolerated dose (mtd) was identified. these response rates are comparable to those at equivalent adult 
 dosing of 100 mg qd. the efficacy of the 60 and 80 mg/m
 2 qd doses were generally comparable; however, the 60 mg/m
 2 dose appeared to be better tolerated than the 80 mg/m2 dose. similar exposure to the dasatinib dose of 60 mg/m
 2 was achieved in paediatric subjects compared to adult dose of 100 mg qd. the mean observed cavgss (cv%) value in study ca180018 was 
 12.79 (59.1%) ng/ml with 60 mg/m
 2 qd dasatinib, similar to the mean (cv%) value of 14.16 (20%) ng/ml in adults. similarly, the mean observed minimum concentration (cmin) ± sd 
 value was 1.8 ± 1.2 ng/ml at 24 hours post-dose for 60 mg/m
 2 qd in paediatric subjects, whereas in adults, the mean steady state cmin (cminss) (cv%) value was 2.69 (26%) ng/ml with 100 mg qd. 
 the range of the cminss values for paediatric and adult subjects overlapped. 
 simulation was conducted to predict dasatinib exposure provided by the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet in paediatric subjects across their body weight range. it showed that the predicted paediatric exposures (cavgss, 
 cminss and cmaxss) increased slightly with increasing body weight, but generally are consistent with 
 the adult exposures across the body weight range observed in the paediatric clinical studies. 
 the benefit-risk profile at tablet dose of 60 mg/m
 2 was further characterized and confirmed in the phase 2 study ca180226. the high and durable responses (both cytogenetic and molecular) observed 
 in the study at 60 mg/m
 2</p><p>tablet are as high as those reported for adult cml-cp treated with dasatinib 
 and for paediatric cml-cp treated with first line imatinib. the safety profile of dasatinib 60 mg/m
 2 tablet in ca180226 with paediatric cml-cp subjects was manageable and generally consistent with adult data, except that there were no events of pleural/pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema / 
 hypertension, or arterial pulmonary hypertension related to dasatinib. 
 weight-tiered (wt) dosing - tablets:</p><p>
 wt-tiered dosing in paediatric patients was further evaluated by simulating dasatinib exposures for 
 each body weight tier using the paediatric ppk model (5-120 kg with every 5 kg increment) under 
 various dosing scenarios (tablet dose from 20 to 100 mg), taking into account the available tablet 
 dosing strengths. the wt-tiered doses were selected to produce similar summary steady-state 
 exposures to target exposures of the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet qd, which have been demonstrated in study ca180226 to be safe and efﬁcacious in paediatric ph+ cml-cp patients. the exposures were 
 considered similar if the difference in geometric mean of simulated steady-state exposures are within 
 20%. based on the simulations, tablet doses of 40 mg, 60 mg and 70 mg are suggested for paediatric 
 patients weighing from 10 to &lt;20 kg, 20 to &lt;30 kg and 30 to &lt;45 kg, respectively. paediatric patients 
 weighing at least 45 kg should receive the dose of 100 mg tablet. the tablet formulation is not 
 recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg, the powder for oral suspension should be use for 
 these patients.</p></section><section><header>table 15: selected dosage of dasatinib tablets for paediatric patients with ph+ cp cml</header></section><section><header>body weight (kg) daily dose (mg)</header><p>10 to less than 20 kg 40 mg 20 to less than 30 kg 60 mg 30 to less than 45 kg 70 mg at least 45 kg

 pfos – proposed dose</p><p>90 mg/m2 dasatinib pfos has been developed for use in paediatric patients who cannot swallow tablets. the be study ca180352 characterized the pk of the pfos and evaluated the bioequivalence of dasatinib 
 between the pfos or dispersed tablet and the marketed tablet in healthy adult subjects. results 
 showed that the pfos and the dispersed tablet were not bioequivalent to the intact tablet formulation. 
 the exposure (by auc[inf]) for pfos was found to be approximately 19% less than intact tablets in 
 healthy adults. 
 the ppk analysis showed that dasatinib administered as pfos resulted in ~40% lower bioavailability in 
 paediatric subjects. the exposure of pfos dose at the studied dose of 72 mg/m
 2 was ~30% lower than that of tablet dose at 60 mg/m
 2, and the magnitude of difference was similar across the age groups.</p><p>the e-r analyses explored the relationship between dasatinib treatment cohort and efficacy of cohort 
 3a with 60 mg/m
 2 tablet and cohort 3b with 72 mg/m2 in the phase 2 study ca180226. results showed that time to achieve mmr was numerically longer, and the rate of decline of bcr-abl was 
 numerically slower in paediatric subjects taking 72 mg/m
 2 pfos relative to those taking 60 mg/m2 tablet, although the difference was not statistically significant. these results suggested that in order to optimize the benefit-risk profile of pfos use, it is optimal to recommend a pfos dose that can match 
 the exposure of the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet. all exposure measures (c
 avgss, cminss and cmaxss) increased with increasing dose of pfos, in a manner proportional to dose. among the simulated pfos doses, the cavgss produced by doses ≤ 80 mg/m
 2 was lower than the reference tablet at 60 mg/m2. at 90 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 pfos, cavgss was similar to the reference values, with less than 10% difference of geometric mean. at higher pfos 
 doses of 110 and 120 mg/m
 2, the cavgss generally exceeded the reference values. a similar trend was observed on the distributions of c
 minss and cmaxss. the cminss produced by 90 and 100 mg/m2 pfos were similar to that of the tablet 60 mg/m
 2. compared to the cmaxss at tablet 60 mg/m2, cmaxss at 90 mg/m2 pfos was similar while that at 100 mg/m2 pfos was approximately 15% higher. these simulation results suggested that among the examined pfos doses, 90 mg/m
 2 provides a similar exposure (&lt;10% difference in geometric mean) to the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet across age groups and all 3 exposure measures. 
 weight-tiered dosing – pfos: 
 ppk model-based simulations were also performed to evaluate and select wt-tiered pfos doses that 
 can provide similar exposure to the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet. the same body weight groups (5-120 kg with every 5 kg increment) and dosing scenarios (pfos doses 20 to 150 mg) were explored and the same 
 exposure similarity criteria (&lt;20% difference in geometric mean) were used as those used in the wt-
 tiered tablet dose selection.</p><p>
 based on the simulations, pfos doses of 40 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg and 105 mg are recommended for 
 paediatric patients weighing from 5 to &lt;10 kg, 10 to &lt;20 kg, 20 to &lt;30 kg and 30 to &lt;45 kg, 
 respectively. paediatric patients weighing at least 45 kg are recommended to take the dose of 120 mg 
 pfos.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 cohort 1: a response rate in excess of 30% for mcyr was considered of clinical interest. the study 
 design tested the null hypothesis that the true mcyr rate was less than or equal to 30% versus the 
 alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 30%. the one-sided type i error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
 a 60% true mcyr rate (30% more than the response rate under the null hypothesis), 25 response-
 evaluable subjects were required to have at least 84% power to reject the null hypothesis. the drug 
 was considered of clinical interest if there were 13 or more responders out of the total of 25 response 
 evaluable subjects. 
 cohort 2: a response rate in excess of 15% for chr was considered of clinical interest. the study 
 design tested the null hypothesis that the true chr rate was less than or equal to 15% versus the 
 alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 15%. the one-sided type i error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
 a 35% true chr (20% more than the response rate under the null hypothesis), 34 response-evaluable 
 subjects were required to have at least 80% power to reject the null hypothesis. the drug was 
 considered of clinical interest if there were at least 10 responders out of the total of 34 dasatinib 
 response-evaluable subjects. however, given that enrollment into cohort 2 was closed early before 34 
 response evaluable subjects were treated, analyses with respect to that cohort was based on 17 
 treated subjects. the drug was considered of clinical interest in this cohort if there were at least 7 
 responders out of 17 response evaluable subjects. 
 cohort 3: a response rate in excess of 55% for ccyr was considered of clinical interest. the study 
 design tested the null hypothesis that the true ccyr rate was less than or equal to 55% versus the 
 alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 55%. the one-sided type i error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
 a 75% true ccyr rate among newly diagnosed subjects with cp cml (20% more than the response 
 rate under the null hypothesis), 50 response-evaluable subjects in cohort 3a yielded 83% power to 
 reject the null hypothesis. the drug was considered of clinical interest if there were 35 or more

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>three trials supporting this application of dasatinib for the treatment of children and adolescents aged 1 year to 18 years with ph+ chronic phase cml are open label, non-comparative trials. 
 trial ca180018 was a phase i study in which six patients were treated at 80mg/m
 2 qd and eleven patients at 60mg/m
 2 qd, with comparable response rates at the two dose levels. although the rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses were higher in patients treated with the higher dasatinib dose 
 (80 mg/m
 2) than with the lower one (60mg/m2) (while molecular response rates were lower with the higher dose), the conclusion that the dose of 60mg/m2 is the recommended dose for phase ii is 
 acceptable, as the number of subjects in each group was very low for these differences to be valued.</p><p>
 trial ca180226, considered the pivotal study, was a phase ii where patients in cohort 1 (imatinib-
 resistant/intolerant cml-cp) and cohort 3 (newly diagnosed treatment-naïve cml-cp, subdivided in 
 cohorts 3a, with tablet dosing, and 3b, with powder for oral suspension dosing) were treated with 
 dasatinib 60mg/m2 qd.</p><p>
 a third study was presented (study ca180038), a phase i trial mainly enrolling patients with solid 
 tumor diagnoses, and only 9 patients with cml in non-described phases, who weren’t assessed for 
 efficacy with the adequate endpoints for cml. this study is not contributive for the present assessment 
 of efficacy.</p><p> 
 given the low incidence of cml in the paediatric age, and the limited scope of this application for a new 
 formulation in a new indication of a drug that is approved and well-studied in adults in the same 
 indication, as well as the rather objective endpoints of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular

 months, and 98% at 12 months – 67% and 96% being complete, respectively. by molecular biology 
 31% obtained the classic mmr endpoint at 6 months and 57% at 12 months, 88% at any time on 
 tablet treatment. for newly diagnosed patients in the main study on planned daily pfos treatment 
 72mg/m2 (cohort 3b, 33 patients), the same efficacy endpoints were: 91% chr at any time, 91% had 
 mcyr at 6 months and 94% at 12 months – of these 70% and 88% were complete, respectively. by 
 molecular biology 18% had mmr at 6 months, 46% at 12 months, and 67% at any time.</p><p>
 other parameters like mr4 and cmr also show less effect by molecular biology in the pfos group, 
 whereas the time to obtain ccyr is the same (5.5 months). the overall survival for the newly 
 diagnosed patients is identical, whatever the treatment, but it is a major concern that the efficacy by 
 molecular biology is slower and less than on dasatinib tablet treatment. one way to interpret these 
 results are that in a limited group of patients, who do achieve a complete cytogenetic remission and 
 acceptable mmr rates, the risk for disease progression even over more than 5 years of follow up do not 
 necessarily reflect significantly in the results on survival. however, it was demonstrated – as expected 
 from adult cml monitoring – that the progression free survival in landmark plot by 
 bcr-abl less or above 10% at three months in all treated subjects, newly diagnosed treatment naïve patients was 
 significantly less (40%) at 4-5 years in the group with sub-optimal response, versus optimal response 
 patients with a pfs of 90%.</p><p>
 it is acknowledged that the number of paediatric patients is very low, and it is not questioned that the 
 pfos formulation and administration really fulfil an unmet medical need, which was initiated by a 
 request from chmp / pdco some ten years ago. it is convincingly demonstrated that dasatinib 
 treatment has a better effect in cml-cp in children, compared with historic data on imatinib. this is not 
 only due to a pfos administration 
 per se, but the effect of a more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) contributes as well. clinical data of pfos supports its use in paediatric cml-cp patients, and the 
 concern of efficacy when compared to tablet formulation in children, and compared to adults may now 
 be reviewed again. 
 it has been questioned if paediatric cml-cp is the same disease biologically as adult cml-cp. the key 
 pathological factor is the t(9;22), which justifies treatment by the tki principle, but there seems to be 
 differences in host factors and cell biology translating to another clinical presentation (hijiya et al. 
 blood 2016
 ). however, the only rational practice, until further is to treat in the same way as in adult 
 patients, and adhere to the same guidelines from eln, in europe (baccarani et al. 
 blood 2013
 )
 . 
 therefore, when a child is diagnosed with cml-cp the treatment will be evaluated by the recognized 
 response criteria at regular intervals (3,6,12 months in the first year). accepting the present 
 application and the justification for the dose pfos 90 mg/m2 in children, the concern of a reduced 
 effect previously, may consequently be anticipated to be corrected by a dose-adjustment if the 
 response is not optimal, as in treatment routinely using the optimal starting dose in adults. 
 measurement of p-dasatinib is not available in common practice, nor are plasma-measurements of 
 other tki. therefore, the monitoring of the young patients is as important to perform, as in adult cml 
 patients, e.g. due to an increasing weight or adverse events, necessitating to consider dose 
 adjustments. the narratives on three patients, who were increased in pfos dosage, have been noticed 
 and that the treatment apparently was changed in two patients at a relatively late time in the 
 treatment, for which there may be various explanations.</p><p>
 the response assessment using hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular criteria are emphasized 
 together with the recommendation for dose adjustments in the smpc section 4.2. naturally, any 
 treatment effect is also a compromise in adverse events and toxicity, which play an important role in</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/302652/2018</p><p>
 page 61/82 
 treatment of the individual patient, and with a major importance due to the likely need for chronic treatment and still un-settled risks in this context of young patients. the recommendation in the 
 smpc: “the following dose escalations shown in table 2 are recommended in paediatric patients who 
 do not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response” is therefore suggested to highlight that the 
 response must be reached at the recommended time points (refer to the product information) and 
 maintained after the first year. the recommendations in dose adjustments for adverse reactions are 
 endorsed. if a dose-increase seems justified due to an unsatisfactory pcr-level, but is not possible to 
 implement due to adverse events, despite measures to try to reduce these manifestations, which may 
 reduce qol significantly, a change in treatment medication, perhaps mutation analysis has to be 
 considered. the dosing schedule may also contribute to reduce the risk for administration of under-
 dosing in children, which has been observed in report on medication errors and off-label use from 28-
 jun-2015 through 27-june-2017,</p><p>
 it is accepted that the major molecular response rate at 12 months on pfos is reported to be 45%, 
 which do indicate that 55% of the young patients do not. the mmr, or better is considered a clinical, 
 safe hallmark in adult cml treatment. the mmr response rate increase after the first year, reflecting 
 the optimal response obtained over time, but also the limbo according to present cml-guidelines, for 
 the patients not in mmr after one year or thereafter – until strict failure may occur. however, the 
 results presented underline the importance of response evaluation in the individual patient, as in adult 
 patients. any positive immune-modulating effect of dasatinib in children, in tablet or pfos formulation 
 in children is not clarified, but it may very well add to the long-term effect, because response rates 
 increases over time.</p><p>
 the tablet dose of 60 mg/ m
 2 qd for paediatric subjects with cml-cp is supported. it has been sufficiently demonstrated that exposure matches the adult dose of 100 mg qd for the same indication. 
 the proposed pfos dose is based on simulations as it was demonstrated that the bioavailability of 
 pfos compared to tablets in paediatric subjects appeared to be lower in paediatric subjects than in 
 adults. to achieve similar exposure with the pfos as tablet 60 mg/m
 2, the pfos dose should be 90 mg/m
 2. the dosage of 90 mg/m2 pfos is justified for children from 1 year of age and day 1 in treatment with dasatinib. (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). however, since no paediatric 
 subjects have been treated with the proposed dose in a clinical setting, methods to ensure close 
 monitoring in the post marketing setting are warranted (see rmp).</p><p>
 in the main study, previously treated, cml-cp patients, the same key-endpoint in imatinib resistant 
 (34 patients) versus intolerant patients (10 patients), showed an unconfirmed chr rate at any time in 
 all patients (pooled results), and mcyr at six months (79/90%) and at 12 months (85/100%), of these 
 (74/80%) and 77/80%) were complete, respectively. the mmr at 3 months was (15/20%), at 6 
 months (26/30%) and at 12 months (41/40%). mmr was achieved in 56% and 60%, respectively at 
 any time. the results indicate a more slowly effect in resistant patients, than in imatinib-intolerant, but 
 overall obtained almost the same effect by efficacy parameters in this limited group of patients, but 
 with a trend in particular for resistant patients of less molecular responses. this pattern of results is 
 positive for the effect on previously treated patients as a group, and indicate that dasatinib do 
 overcome imatinib resistance. this pattern of results is somewhat expected compared to the tki-naïve 
 dasatinib-treated patients as a group.</p><p> 
 no point-mutations were demonstrated in six newly diagnosed, tablet treated patients albeit at 
 different time upon disease progression. no subjects in the pfos treated cohort with mutation data 
 had bcr-abl mutations at the time of disease progression, treatment failure, or end of treatment, 
 including the 1 subject in cohort 3b with disease progression. it may indicate that dasatinib do not 
 cause a specific selection pressure in newly diagnosed cml-cp paediatric patients.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the efficacy and survival of patients with ph+ advanced disease (ap,bp and acute leukaemias)</p><p>11 treated subjects (of a total group of 58 patients) in study 180018 and 180226 (all prior imatinib 
 treated) showed an effect of dasatinib treatment, e.g. by 27% chr at any time, on monotherapy in a 
 group of patients with dubious prognosis. the follow-up time (survival) is very short. no results on 
 effect and safety seem to contra-indicate the use in cp, although observations are confounded by 
 many other factors. detailed narratives have been provided for seven patients (6 subjects with acute 
 lymphoblastic leukemia [all] from either ca180018 or ca180226 [cohort 2] and 1 chronic myeloid 
 leukemia-blast phase [cml-bp] subject from ca180226 [cohort 2]) who died of causes other than 
 disease progression. the cause of those 7 deaths were due to expected complications, and the 
 information do not indicate any relation to the dasatinib monotherapy, which however may only be 
 considered a palliative option in these circumstances.</p><p>
 the number of patients in non-white race categories are limited, but is considered acceptable because 
 satisfactory results on efficacy have been reported in adult (east) asian population.</p><p>
 nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the number of paediatric patients is in overall very low, however 
 the pfos formulation and administration will indeed fulfil an unmet medical need, as per a request 
 from chmp / pdco.</p><p>
 the results presented, based on patient cohorts, criteria and design of studies on paediatric cml-cp, in 
 imatinib treated or newly diagnosed children, support the applied indication by dasatinib tablet 
 treatment. the introduction of an oral formulation, pfos into clinical practice is well prepared and very

 a similar pattern of aes is observed in newly diagnosed and previously tki-treated cml-cp patients. almost all subjects experience ae, and excpet for hematologic aes manifested by cytopenias most ae 
 are less than grade 3. the two most notably observations is the very positive result that no deaths 
 were recorded in cp patients, and the second is the abscence of pleural effusions, which is a frequent 
 clinical problem in treatment of adult cml. pediatric patients in the ca180226 trial had an 
 approximately 50% lower cmin with dasatinib 60 mg/m2 tablet than adult patients with dasatinib 100 
 mg. thus, the frequency of events of pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, 
 or pulmonary hypertension were expected to be lower (or absent) in pediatric patients treated with the 
 60 mg/m2 dose of dasatinib. moreover, dasatinib-related pleural effusion may occur through a 
 reduction in interstitial fluid pressure or vascular permeability changes, which are more frequent in 
 adults.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</header><p>symptoms like diarrhoea, rash, headache, oedema and muscle-joint are present to a similar degree as the ae profile of dasatinib in adults. some symptoms like diarrhea may be potentially more dangerous 
 in small children than in adults, but still almost always less than grade 3. some cardiac manifestations 
 have been observed, however not severe and appear manageable. no clinically meaningful cardiac 
 impact on qtc or function seems to have been observed.</p><p> 
 likely, the less concurrent comorbidity at inclusion or follow-up in children compared to adult patients 
 have some influence on the impression of an acceptable ae profile of dasatinib in first- or second line 
 treatment in cml-cp. bleeding may pose a problem in adults, and have been observed, but none 
 severe. paediatric growth and development aes were not observed in dasatinib first line treatment, 
 and observations in previously treated patients may include some late effect of imatinib. therefore the 
 planned follow-up on all patients is very relevant to settle this ae, which however may improve over 
 time and may be considered acceptable given the indication, and in only 2% considered to be severe.</p><p>
 the current protocol language defines the duration of long-term growth and development 
 assessments in alignment with the rmp and pip, which is a yearly assessment while on treatment and 
 yearly for up to 5 years after treatment discontinuation. overall, 23 subjects were enrolled in cohort 3 
 (&lt; 11 years old), and currently &gt;50% of those subjects are on treatment after more than 5 years. 
 there is no protocol defined end of long-term growth and development assessments on treatment. 
 bms agrees to amend study ca180226 to require early long-term growth and development 
 assessments for subjects on treatment in cohort 3 who were &lt; 11 years old when enrolled, continuing 
 until subjects are 18 years old. it is noticed, that overall, 3 subjects in the study received 
 levothyroxine while on treatment with dasatinib.</p><p>

 patients (35%) than in newly-diagnosed treated by dasatinib (26%) (table 2.3-1). as expected the

 of dasatinib administered in pfos formulation was 72 mg/m2 and subjects in this cohort were required 
 to take dasatinib pfos formulation for a minimum of 12 months. after 12 months, those subjects who 
 remained on study were allowed to switch to take dasatinib tablet formulation if they chose. 
 the median duration of dasatinib pfos therapy in ca180226 was 12 months and the median daily 
 dose was 71.26 mg/m2/day. twenty-two subjects (66.7%) had pfos to tablet change, while 6 
 subjects continue to receive pfos. 
 no clinically relevant safety concerns were noted in treatment-naive paediatric subjects treated with 
 tablets or with pfos during the first year of treatment. no differences in the safety profile were noted 
 between tablets and pfos. 
  no deaths or drug-related saes were reported in naive cml-cp subjects treated with pfos.  aes leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 3 (3.6%) subjects. all of these aes (drug hypersensitivity, leukemia, and leukemia recurrent) were grade 3-4 and subjects 
 discontinued due to aes during the first year of treatment. only 1 subject discontinued

 3.1-1 and 3.2.3-1) illustrate neutropenia as the most frequent – and well-known and manageable 
 situation at specialized departments where these patient are followed. the risk of grade 4 
 thrombopenia in a child pose probably in most instances a less risk than in an adult, and in particular 
 elderly patient due to less risk of a vascular component for bleeding. the fact that all patients in cp are 
 alive is an indirect parameter to support the point of view of manageable handling of – also laboratory 
 - grade 3-4 aes in children on dasatinib treatment. treatment with dasatinib in paediatric cml-cp is 
 associated with very limited renal, hepatic or electrolyte impact. the summary of on-treatment grade 
 4 abnormalities indicate a trend to more affected patients in the imatinib treated group, but minor 
 differences and most less than 5%, except neutropenia. the results add value to the safety of 
 dasatinib treatment, at the recommended dosage, for the applied indication.</p></section><section><header>safety in special populations</header><p>the clinical studies in paediatric ph+ positive leukaemias, and most relevantly assessed in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia do not indicate any association to efficacy or safety and intrinsic or

 amongst pfos treated children, two patients discontinued due to leukaemia/leukaemia relapse (cml) 
 during treatment, within the first year. the disease progression rate on dasatinib / imatinib in the 
 dasision study (258 patients, each arm) were at two years: 5/7%, and the treatment failure (no 
 remission) rate 3/4%. progression or treatment failure (combined) at five years in the dasision study 
 was reported to be 11/14% for dasatinib / imatinib treatment, respectively. the observed “leukaemia 
 risk” in pfos at one year may be interpreted as 2/33 subjects or 6% at one year, which may be 
 comparable to tki effects observed in the dasision study in adults. at one year is before the patients 
 could switch to tablets and may be associated with the relatively reduced efficacy in clonal control of 
 cml addressed previously. responses to dasatinib pfos observed in study ca180226 by hematologic, 
 cytogenetic and molecular responses support the comparability of dasatinib pfos treatment of 
 pediatric treatment-naive ph+ cml-cp to tablet treatment of adult treatment-naive ph+ cml-cp</p></section><section><header>immunological events</header><p>dasatinib has not been reported to cause an antibody production in treated patients. the medication may however cause immunomodulatory effects, which also may be important for the effect. 
 lymphocytosis after treatment with dasatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia is prognostic for the effects 
 on response and toxicity in adult cml patients. patients under 12 years old do not generally have the 
 consistent consecutive lymphocyte levels required to meet the definition of lymphocytosis, and thus, 
 were not included in the analysis presented here. no definitive conclusion can be drawn from 2 
 subjects &gt; 12 year pertaining the impact of lymphocytosis.</p></section><section><header>safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</header><p>specific drug interaction studies have only been conducted in adults. no new information in paediatric subjects is available. the interaction with grape-fruit or juice is well known to increase the exposure to

 emphasis is suggested in the pi, than already stated.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation due to aes</header><p>discontinuations due to aes in paediatric ph+ leukaemia occur with an acceptable incidence depending on diagnostic population. in particular in the chronic phase of disease, discontinuation regardless of

 resistant/intolerant groups no more than 1 subject reported an ae leading to discontinuation for any 
 particular preferred term. the result is based on an acceptable number of patients to support the

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>clinical safety in adult cml patients involve aspects like cardiac effects, effusions, infections and bone marrow insufficiency, among many others, although manageable. the results on clinical safety in 
 children aged 1-18 years-old, exposed in the majority to the medication in more than two years, with 
 cml-cp for the assessment of dasatinib in 84 newly diagnosed and in 46 imatinib treated have not 
 identified novel issues, and the most frequent ae are dispersed over different manifestations like 
 headache, nausea, stomach and intestinal discomfort, physical disability, skin inconveniences and in 
 particular leuko-neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and a risk of infections – all of which 
 affect quality of life in young patients.</p><p>
 the overall safety profile of sprycel in the paediatric population was similar to that of the adult 
 population, regardless of formulation, with the exception of no reported pericardial effusion, pleural 
 effusion, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary hypertension in the paediatric population. of the 
 130 sprycel-treated paediatric subjects with cml-cp, 2 (1.5%) experienced adverse reactions leading 
 to treatment discontinuation (see smpc section 4.8.) 
 dasatinib has a myelosuppressive effect. the difference compared to adult patients is that the aes may 
 more rapidly progress from a mild to a severe clinical situation – infections, diarrhoea possibly most 
 important. unexpectedly, no pleural (or other effusions) were observed in newly diagnosed patients, 
 despite an exposure in most patients of more than two years. the pattern of aes were not significantly 
 different in previously imatinib treated patients.</p><p>
 even though merely all patients experience some ae, the minor part are severe, and in cml-cp leads 
 to treatment discontinuation in less than 5%. severe and fatal aes were reported more frequently in 
 advanced phase cml and ph+ all than chronic phase cml as would be expected based on the 
 underlying disease. in the cml-cp pooled population, the incidence of drug-related serious adverse 
 events can be considered low and most events concern haematological toxicity or fever/infection. in 
 this population, 4 (8.7%) deaths may appear significant but it is noted that all the cases were reported 
 in the imatinib resistant/intolerant group. all subjects had progressed and deaths occurred after 30 
 days from last dose. 
 in paediatric trials of sprycel in imatinib-resistant/intolerant paediatric patients and treatment-naive 
 paediatric patients after at least 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events associated 
 with bone growth and development were reported in 6 (4.6%) patients, one of which was severe in 
 intensity (growth retardation grade 3). these 6 cases included cases of epiphyses delayed fusion, 
 osteopaenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia (see smpc section 4.4. and 5.1). these results are 
 difficult to interpret in the context of chronic diseases such as cml, and require long-term follow-up 
 (see rmp). 
 attention should be paid to hormonal effects or cardiac toxicity during long-term treatment, and any 
 impact is expected to be captured by psur.</p><p>(thyroid-) hormonal adverse events are mentioned in the

 cure, as in adults has not been proven in children. hsct is considered in case of disease progression, 
 provided a suitable sibling or unrelated donor, but associated with a risk of mortality and chronic 
 morbidity, justified by the cure rate of 70-80%. alternative monotherapy like interferon-alfa is rarely 
 used in cml anymore, due to less efficacy and more safety issues than tki, although without long 
 term side-effects. introduction of 2
 nd generation tki like dasatinib may overcome imatinib resistance, relapse and intolerance and thereby postpone or eliminate the need for hsct, with favourable 
 prognosis (in adults).</p><p>
 it is therefore an unmet need to have a second line treatment or an alternative first line treatment in 
 cml-cp with a disease-specific tki. an improved os has not been demonstrated in adults comparing 
 imatinib and dasatinib, but dasatinib do generally induce more rapid cyr and mr than imatinib in tki 
 naïve patients. the administration of tablets to small children is a well-known obstacle, which may 
 improve by introduction of a powder for oral suspension (pfos) of dasatinib. results are presented as

 relapsed after imatinib treatment (n = 58) and 3: newly-diagnosed cml-cp (tki-naive), divided in 
 patients for tablet treatment (3a, n=51) or pfos (3b, n=33). after one year treatment, patients in 
 group 3b may use tablets instead of pfos. the dosage in cml-cp (cohort 1 and 3a) was 60 mg 
 dasatinib/m2 as tablet (which may be dispersed), or in cohort 3b pfos 72 mg/m2 once daily. dosing 
 was 80 mg/m2 qd in cohort 2, reasoned by the much more aggressive disease biology. study start 
 was 20-03 2009, data-base lock 04-11 2016 in cohort 1, cohort 2 was terminated by mdc due to lack 
 of efficacy, and cohort 3 is ongoing. by the time of database closure, in cohort 3a (tablet dosing), 37

 has been addressed with a pfos dose increase to 90 mg/m2. the dosage of 90 mg/m2 pfos is now satisfactorily justified for children &lt; 45 kg from 1 year of age and day 1 in treatment with dasatinib.</p><p>
 paediatric and adults patients &gt; 45 kg are likely to have similar physiology and for patients &gt; 45 kg 
 pfos dose of 120 mg is proposed in line with the findings in the adult be study. this is reflected in the 
 smpc.</p><p>
 the safety profile in paediatric patients was comparable to the safety profile in adults. frequency, type 
 and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>the administration of tablets to small children is a well-known problem, which is addressed by the introduction of a powder for oral suspension (pfos) of dasatinib.

 conclusions</header><p>the overall b/r of sprycel 10 mg/ml powder for oral suspension for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in

 recommendations</header></section><section><header>similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products</header><p>the chmp by consensus is of the opinion that sprycel is not similar to tasigna (nilotinib) and iclusig (ponatinib) within the meaning of article 3 of commission regulation (ec) no. 847/200. see 
 appendix1.</p></section><section><header>outcome</header><p>based on the chmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the chmp considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of, sprycel 10 mg/ml powder for oral suspension is favourable in the 
 following indication: 
 sprycel is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed philadelphia 
 chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in chronic phase (ph+ cml cp), or with ph+ 
 cml cp resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib.</p><p>
 the chmp therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for sprycel subject to</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the following conditions:</p></section><section><header>conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use</header><p>medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see annex i: summary of product characteristics, section 4.2).</p></section><section><header>conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation</header></section><section><header>periodic safety update reports</header><p>the requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of union reference dates (eurd list) provided for under article 107c(7) of directive 
 2001/83/ec and any subsequent updates published on the european medicines web-portal.</p></section><section><header>conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product</header></section><section><header>risk management plan (rmp)</header><p>the mah shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed rmp presented in module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
 updates of the rmp. 
 an updated rmp should be submitted: 
  at the request of the european medicines agency;  whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
 as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
 reached.</p></section><section><header>paediatric data</header><p>furthermore, the chmp reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed paediatric investigation plan p/0118/2013</p><p>and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
 summary of product characteristics (smpc) and, as appropriate, the package leaflet. 
 in accordance with article 45(3) of regulation (ec) no 1901/2006, significant studies in the agreed 
 paediatric investigation plan p/0118/2013 have been completed after the entry into force of that 
 regulation. 
 in addition, chmp recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation concerning 
 the following changes:</p></section><section><header>variation(s) requested type</header><p>c.i.6.a c.i.6.a - change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - addition of a new

 order to add the new indication and its relevant posology, to add a warning on effects on growth and 
 development in the paediatric population and to update the safety information.</p><p>
 the annex a, annex ii, labelling, package leaflet and rmp (version 15.3) are updated in accordance.</p></section><section><header>appendix</header><p>1. chmp ar on similarity dated 26 april 2017.</p></section></body></xml>
