 disease or condition</header><p>this application is for extending the indication of enzalutamide to include treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nm-crpc) who are at high risk of developing 
 metastatic disease (psa doubling time 
 ≤ 10 months and psa levels ≥</p><p>2 ng/ml). castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) is defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite 
 castrate levels of testosterone while on treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone 
 analogue (lhrha), or following bilateral orchiectomy. this disease was previously known as hormone-
 refractory prostate cancer until research demonstrated that the majority of these resistant cancers 
 overexpress the ar and may remain sensitive to more potent hormonal agents than those approved at 
 the time (e,g., first generation antiandrogens such as flutamide or bicalutamide) [chen et al, 2004].</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology</header><p>in europe (france, germany, italy, spain, united kingdom), it is estimated that nm-crpc represents 7% of all prostate cancer cases. the current prediction is that the 5-year prevalence will increase in 
 the future from 89,810 patients in 2016 to 110,290 patients in 2026. 
 in the united states (us), the incidence of nm-crpc has been estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 men 
 per year, with a 34% annual rate of progression to metastatic crpc (mcrpc), with rapidly rising psa 
 [ie, a psa doubling time (psadt) of 
 ≤ 10 months] conferring greater risk. of nm-crpc patients, 33% developed bone metastasis within 2 years.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.  clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage</header><p>prostate cancer progresses through a series of characteristic clinical states that represent both the natural history of the disease and the response to treatment, as depicted in the below figure [scher &amp; 
 heller, 2000].</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 8/90</p><p> following the initial evaluation and diagnosis of prostate cancer, approximately 90% of men undergo primary localized treatment with curative intent [cooperberg et al, 2010].</p><p>androgen deprivation 
 therapy (adt) (i.e., surgical or medical castration) is often initiated in men with rising prostate-specific 
 antigen (psa) after primary therapy.</p><p>following adt, the next most frequent clinical state in the 
 current model of prostate cancer progression is that of crpc, defined as disease progression despite 
 castrate hormone levels (testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dl).</p><p>
 men with crpc can have metastatic or non-metastatic disease, which has traditionally been 
 determined by means of computed tomography (ct) or magnetic resonance imaging (mri), as well as 
 radionuclide bone scans.</p><p>in the majority of patients, metastatic crpc evolves from non-metastatic 
 crpc and psa doubling time has been shown to be a strong predictor of the development of 
 metastases in these patients.</p><p>thus, psa doubling time is reported as a useful prognostic factor in 
 identifying patients at high-risk of development of clinically detectable metastatic disease (i.e., disease 
 progression) [moreira et al, 2015; scher et al, 2015].</p><p>various studies have assessed a range of psa 
 doubling times, with one study showing that a psa doubling time of &lt; 6 months was associated with 
 an 11-fold higher risk of disease progression compared with a psa doubling time of &gt; 10 months 
 [nguyen et al, 2015].</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  management</header><p>no therapy is currently approved for, nor has shown delay in, progression from non-metastatic to metastatic crpc.</p><p>
 although high-risk non-metastatic crpc (i.e., for patients with a short psa doubling time) is a disease 
 state, current treatment options are limited. per a provisional opinion from the american society of 
 clinical oncology (asco), second-line hormonal therapy (e.g., antiandrogens, cytochrome p450 [cyp] 
 17 inhibitors) may be considered in patients with nonmetastatic crpc at high risk for metastatic 
 disease (based on a short psa doubling time or rapid velocity), but otherwise this treatment is not 
 suggested [virgo et al, 2017]. similarly, the national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) 
 guideline recommends first-generation antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide), 
 second-generation novel hormonal therapies (enzalutamide, abiraterone), ketoconazole, 
 corticosteroids or diethylstilbestrol as second-line hormonal therapies [nccn, 2017]. the european 
 society for medical oncology guidelines advise adt and watchful waiting [parker et al, 2015]. thus, 
 although continued use of adt is part of clinical practice, no therapy is approved specifically for the 
 treatment of patients with nonmetastatic crpc.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 page 9/90</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>enzalutamide (mdv3100) is a potent oral ar inhibitor that targets the androgen receptor (ar) signaling pathway.</p><p>enzalutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to the ar and, consequently, 
 inhibits nuclear translocation of the ar and inhibits the association of the ar with dna even in the 
 setting of ar overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti androgens. enzalutamide 
 treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour 
 regression. in preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant 
 prostate cancer (crpc) who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen 
 deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated; and for the treatment of 
 adult men with metastatic crpc whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>this application seeks to broaden the current enzalutamide indication to include patients with non-metastatic crpc. 
 the initially proposed wording was “the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-
 resistant prostate cancer”. 
 the finally approved wording was “the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
 castration-resistant prostate cancer”. 
 xtandi is available in two pharmaceutical forms; capsule and tablet. the recommended dose is 160 mg 
 enzalutamide as a single oral daily dose. this extension of indication covers both forms.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.

 original marketing application and in the subsequent variation application related the chemotherapy-
 naïve indication.</p><p> 
 in the original marketing application, the 
 in vitro plasma protein binding of enzalutamide, m1 and m2 was determined by equilibrium dialysis in plasma from mouse (cd1 [icr]), rat (sprague dawley), 
 rabbit, monkey and/or human. 
 an additional study was performed with 14c-enzalutamide, 14c-m1 and 14c-m2 in order to determine 
 the plasma protein binding of enzalutamide, m1 and m2 in non-transgenic littermate of transgenic 
 rash2 (non-tg rash2) mouse and wistar hanover (wh) rat plasma by equilibrium dialysis [study 
 9785-me-0045]; the same mouse and rat strains used in the enzalutamide carcinogenicity studies.</p><p>
 plasma protein binding ratio of 14c-enzalutamide in non-tg rash2 mouse and wh rats ranged from 
 96.8% to 97.7% and 95.0% to 95.9%, respectively. respective plasma protein binding ratio of 14c-
 m1 ranged from 92.6% to 92.9% and 96.5% to 96.9%. respective plasma protein binding ratio of 
 14c-m2 ranged from 93.8% to 94.0% and 91.0% to 91.5%. 
 the in vitro plasma protein binding of enzalutamide was generally comparable in mouse (95% to 
 98%), rat (94% to 96%), rabbit (88% to 90%), dog (94% to 96%) and human (97% to 98%) [study 
 pro3100nc32 and study 9785-me-0045 combined]. the extent of binding was constant over a wide 
 range of concentrations, 0.05 to 25 μg/ml for all species (0.5 to 25 μg/ml for female rabbits, non-tg 
 rash2 mouse and wh rat plasma).

 in the preliminary 4-week drf study in non-tg rash2 mice [study 9785-tx-0019], enzalutamide 
 related mortality at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg per day occurred within the first week of dosing. there 
 was no additional mortality at 
 ≥</p><p>30 mg/kg per day during the remaining 3 weeks of the study. decreased spontaneous movement, bradypnea and/or hypothermia were observed prior to mortality or 
 when moribund animals were sacrificed. however, the cause of mortality or moribundity could not be 
 established. based on the findings in the drf study, 20 mg/kg per day was used as the highest dose in 
 study 9785-tx-0020 in tg rash2 mice. the low (2 mg/kg/day) and mid (6 mg/kg/day) doses were 
 selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose response. 
 enzalutamide was administered by daily oral gavage to male and female jic:cb6f1-tg rash2@jcl mice 
 (26 or 30 animals/sex per group, 8 weeks of age at the start of dosing) for 26 weeks, at dose levels of 
 0 (negative control, water for injection), 0 (vehicle control, labrasol), 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg per day as solution in labrasol; dosing volume 10 ml/kg. sixteen animals of each sex were included for the 
 positive control group (n-methyl-n-nitrosourea [mnu] 75 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, once).</p><p>systemic 
 exposure (plasma concentrations) of enzalutamide and its metabolites (m1 and m2) was determined in 
 satellite animals (non-tg rash2 mice) on day 1 and during week 26 of the dosing period, and 
 toxicokinetic analysis was completed.</p><p>
 at 20 mg/kg per day, there was mortality of 2 males on days 3 and 4, respectively, of the dosing 
 period.</p><p>a potential cause for the mortality during the first few days of dosing could be lower food 
 consumption, likely due to the unpalatable effect of labrasol.</p><p>similar mortalities were also observed 
 during the first 4 days of the dosing period in the 4-week drf study in non tg rash2 mice [study 
 9785-tx-0019].</p><p>in the drf study, there was a transient body weight decrease (first 4 days of dosing) 
 and reduced food consumption in all groups but mortalities only occurred at doses 
 ≥</p><p>30 mg/kg per day up to day 7 of the dosing period.</p><p>to account for possible early mortalities in the definitive 26 
 week study in tg rash2 mice, 30 mice per sex were initially assigned to the 20 mg/kg per day high 
 dose group.</p><p>following 2 weeks of dosing, 2 additional males (plus 2 mortalities) and 4 females were 
 excluded from the 20 mg/kg per day dose group and the number of animals were adjusted to 26 mice 
 per sex (similar to the other dose groups).</p><p>there was no additional mortality or adverse clinical signs 
 during the remaining period of the study (24 weeks).</p><p>in the positive control group (mnu), there was 
 mortality of all males and 11 of 16 females during the study duration, mainly due to neoplastic 
 findings. the neoplastic findings are summarized in the table below.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the mah submitted the results of a new pharmacokinetic study assessing in vitro plasma protein binding of enzalutamide, metabolite mdpc0001, a carboxylic acid derivative (m1) and metabolite 
 mdpc0002, desmethyl-enzalutamide (m2) in nontransgenic littermates of transgenic rash2 mouse 
 (non-tg rash2 mouse) and wistar hanover (wh) rat plasma (study 9785-me-0045). overall, the 
 plasma protein binding of enzalutamide and the metabolites m1 and m2 in nontransgenic littermates of 
 tg rash2 mice and wh rats were comparable to the other rodent strains used in previously submitted 
 toxicology studies. plasma protein binding was also comparable between rodents and humans. 
 with regards to carcinogenicity, the daily oral administration of enzalutamide for 26 weeks did not 
 demonstrate any neoplastic findings, indicative of a lack of carcinogenic potential in the tg rash2 mice 
 at a dose of ≤ 20 mg/kg per day. however, taking into account that the plasma exposure levels at 20 
 mg/kg/day (348 µg.h/ml and 286 µg.h/ml, in females and males respectively) were similar to the 
 clinical exposure in metastatic crpc patients receiving 160 mg/kg/day (322 µg.h/ml) and, the 
 auc24h for m1 and m2 ranged from 0.08 to 0.21-fold of those in humans, the carcinogenicity potential 
 of enzalutamide cannot be discarded.</p><p>
 in line with ich s1a guideline, the mah was requested to submit the final study report of the 2-year 
 pivotal study (both sexes) in wistar han (wh) rats during the procedure. in this study increased 
 incidences of the following tumours were considered treatment-related in male wh rats: leydig cell 
 tumour in the testis; benign thymoma in the thymus; and urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the 
 urinary bladder, adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and fibroadenoma in the mammary gland. in 
 female wh rats, treatment-related increases in adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and benign 
 granulosa cell tumour in the ovary were noted. except for the urinary bladder, these tumours were 
 observed in organs that are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis and 
 considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide. leydig cell tumours in rats 
 are generally accepted as not relevant to humans [cook et al, 1999]. the tumours observed in organs 
 that are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis, induced by non-genotoxic 
 compounds, most likely have low relevance to humans under most exposure conditions because 
 humans are quantitatively less sensitive that rats [cook et al., 2015]. 
 urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder is thought to be induced by continuous local 
 irritation of the epithelium by crystals or calculi that consist of excreted carboxylic acid metabolite. 
 calculi and crystals were observed in rat urinary bladders. however, no obvious mechanistic rationale 
 to explain specifically this malignancy can be established. at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day, the 
 exposure multiples of enzalutamide in male rats were 0.28-, 0.76- and 1.4-fold, respectively, of the 
 exposure in humans taking enzalutamide 160 mg/day, while those of the inactive carboxylic acid 
 metabolite were 0.17-, 0.44- and 1.7-fold, respectively. at all dose levels, the exposure multiple of the 
 active metabolite, n-desmethyl enzalutamide, in male rats was less than 0.12-fold. in conclusion, 
 taking into account that exposure levels, based on auc, achieved in the study, for enzalutamide plus 
 its metabolite m2, were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the recommended 
 dose of 160 mg/day (322 µg.h/ml), urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in 
 human cannot be excluded (see section 5.3 of the smpc). 
 an updated environrmental risk assessement has not been submitted with the applied extension of 
 indication since the environmental risk assessment provided in the initial marketing authorisation was 
 based in the prevalence of all castration-resistant prostate cancer (including non-metastatic crpc 
 patients after failure of adt), and the pecsurfacewater used was calculated using a refined fpen based 
 on the prevalence of all crpc. in addition, as part of the post approval commitments after the 
 approval of xtandi in 2013, a full phase i and ii environmental risk assessment program for 
 enzalutamide was completed, which included a fish sexual development test (oecd 234) to evaluate 
 potential endocrine disruptive properties. the results concluded that the placement of enzalutamide on</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 page 20/90</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>the primary efficacy endpoint was bicr-assessed mfs defined as the time from randomization to radiographic progression, or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of 
 radiographic progression whichever occurred first. 
 all study films were read locally at the study site and submitted to the central imaging unit for bicr. 
 each study site designated a radiologist or investigator as the primary imaging reviewer to ensure that 
 all images were read consistently as specified by the protocol.</p></section><section><header>table 2.</header><p>assessment of radiographic progression</p><p>
 key secondary endpoints included time to psa progression (time to a 25% or greater increase and an 
 absolute increase of 2 ng/ml), time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy, and overall survival. 
 additional secondary endpoints included time to pain progression using the bpi-sf; time to first use of 
 cytotoxic chemotherapy; chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival, defined as the time from 
 randomization to the first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer or death due to prostate 
 cancer as assessed by the investigator; chemotherapy-free survival, defined as the time from 
 randomization to the first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer or death due to any 
 cause; psa response rate defined as a reduction in psa of ≥ 50% or ≥ 90% from baseline, or a decline 
 to undetectable levels from baseline; and qol assessed by fact-p (additionally for eq-5d-5l 
 questionnaires and the eortc qlq-pr25 module – data not shown).</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>the following assumptions were used in determining the sample size calculation for the mfs endpoint: • 2:1 enzalutamide to placebo treatment allocation; • an increasing nonuniform accrual of 0.25 patients per month per site with maximum accrual of 63 patients per month; 
 • for mfs, a target hazard ratio of 0.72 at a 2-sided significance level of 5% with 90% power. under an exponential model assumption, the target difference in kaplan-meier estimated 
 medians was 9 months (control median of 24 months versus treatment median of 33 months). 
 the median mfs of 24 months for the placebo group was based on published data (nelson et 
 al, 2009).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 21/90 
 a total of 440 mfs events provided 90% power to detect a target hazard ratio of 0.72 based on a 2-sided log-rank test and the overall significance level of 0.05. a sample size of approximately 1305 
 patients (870 enzalutamide and 435 placebo) was expected to achieve 440 events in approximately 43 
 months.</p><p>
 approximately 10% of patients enrolled were expected to be lost to follow-up, found to have 
 metastatic disease at study entry, or have events censored due to required analytical methods, so 
 approximately 1440 patients (960 enzalutamide and 480 placebo) were targeted to be randomized. 
 the time from date of first randomization until 440 mfs events were observed was estimated to be 
 approximately 43 months. 
 approximately 500 psa progression events were expected at the time of the single mfs analysis. 
 based on a hr assumption of 0.60, this endpoint had &gt;95% power at a 2-sided significance level of 
 0.02 
 approximately 360 new antineoplastic therapy events were expected at the time of the single mfs 
 analysis. this endpoint had 80% power to detect a hr of 0.70 at a 2-sided significance level of 0.02. 
 at the final analysis of os (after 3 interim analyses), 590 death events are required to have 85% 
 power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.77 at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. under an exponential 
 model assumption, the target difference in kaplan-meier estimated medians was expected to be 13.7 
 months (46 months placebo vs. 59.7 months enzalutamide).</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>central randomization to enzalutamide or placebo treatments (2:1) was stratified by the following factors: 
 • psa dt (&lt;6 months versus ≥ 6 months) • baseline use of a bta (yes versus no)</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>this study was blinded and placebo-controlled. all patients, study site personnel (including investigators), and sponsor staff and its representatives were blinded to treatment assignment. 
 the blinded control for this study was placebo capsules (placebo) identical in appearance to the 
 enzalutamide capsules.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>the primary analysis population for efficacy was the itt population, defined as all patients randomly assigned to study treatment, and was based on randomized treatment assignment regardless of 
 whether or not the assigned treatment was administered. 
 primary efficacy endpoint analysis: mfs 
 mfs analyses were performed using a stratified log-rank test to compare the 2 treatment groups using 
 a 2-sided test at a 0.05 level of significance; stratification factors were psa doubling time and prior or 
 current bone-targeting agent.</p><p>
 sensitivity analyses were conducted using modified censoring/event rules. these prespecified 
 sensitivity analyses included the following: a modified mfs analysis defined in which disease 
 progression after initiation of any prostate cancer treatment also counted as an event; a modified mfs 
 analysis in which any death, including any posttreatment death, was considered as an event; a 
 modified mfs analysis to assess the sensitivity of mfs to antineoplastic therapy; mfs based on the</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 prespecified subgroup assessments included the following: psa doubling time; baseline use of a bone-targeting agent; baseline age; baseline ecog performance status; geographic region; total gleason 
 score at diagnosis; and psa, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and hemoglobin levels at baseline.</p><p>
 key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
 the primary mfs endpoint was tested at a 0.05 significance level.</p><p>to maintain the family-wise 2 sided 
 type i error rate at 0.05, if mfs was statistically significant, a parallel testing strategy was used to test 
 os with allocated type i error rate 0.03 and the remaining key secondary endpoints (time to psa 
 progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy) with allocated type i error rate 0.02. 
 time to psa progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy were tested using a 
 sequential approach, and if both were statistically significant, then the 0.02 alpha was reallocated to 
 os to allow for os to be tested at the 0.05 significance level.</p></section><section><header>table 4.</header><p>key efficacy analyses and multiplicity adjustment</p></section><section><header>table 5.</header><p>type i error spending for the overall survival analyses</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 a stratified log-rank test was used to compare the 2 treatment groups for time to pain progression, 
 time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival, and 
 chemotherapy-free survival. 
 psa response rate defined as a reduction in psa of

 criteria not met, receiving excluded concomitant medication, receiving the wrong treatment, not 
 receiving required concomitant medication, not discontinuing per the protocol (ie, developed criteria 
 for discontinuation of study drug but did not discontinue study treatment), receiving an incorrect dose,

 discussion on clinical efficacy</header></section><section><header>design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic crpc (pre and post chemotherapy). the mah is seeking a broad indication in the treatment of patients with crpc for 
 which has submitted the results of two clinical studies: a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
 controlled, phase 3 study mdv3100-14 (prosper) conducted in patients with nonmetastatic crpc, 
 together with supporting data from the nonmetastatic disease subgroup of the randomized, double-
 blind, bicalutamide-controlled, phase 2 study mdv3100-09 (strive). 
 focusing on the main study, the inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the inclusion of patients on 
 treatment with androgen deprivation therapy with a gnrh agonist/antagonist or prior bilateral 
 orchiectomy, but castration resistant in terms of psa progression (m0crpc) at high risk as defined by 
 psadt &lt; 10 months. precisely, the definition of this high risk population seems to be the reason for 
 treating with enzalutamide, given the higher risk of developing metastases and eventually the potential 
 impact in both, os and qol. therefore, a more precise definition of patients to be treated with 
 enzalutamide has been included in the section 4.1 of the smpc.</p><p>mfs was chosen as primary endpoint. from a patient perspective, and clinical view, the use of this 
 variable is acknowledged (see also sag discussion). the fact of being able to delay the onset of 
 metastases represents a valuable objective. nonetheless, given that the vast majority of these 
 metastases in prostate cancer are asymptomatic, other variables should be kept in mind. indeed, the 
 fact of delaying the onset of metastasis has not been linked with an increase in os. as a consequence, 
 besides time to psa progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy, os along with 
 time to pain progression and time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, were also included. 
 the methods to analyse the primary and secondary endpoints seem, overall, acceptable. the company 
 has partially followed the chmp’s sa in relation to the primary endpoint. bicr assessment was 
 recommended.</p><p>
 the sample size calculation and assumptions were not very challenging, with an expected hr of 0.72. 
 of note, the study was powered to find differences in time to psa progression and os. 
 the blind design of the study, even supported, could pose challenges, taking into account the 
 comparator arm and the psa progression. nevertheless, as the primary endpoint was evaluated by a 
 bicr, this was accepted. 
 stratification factors are also agreed, although a region stratum should have been included. in this 
 regard, is reassuring that the subgroups analysis on mfs did not show important differences according 
 to regions.</p><p>
 the phase 2 supportive study (strive) was designed in a different population, with metastatic and no 
 metastatic patients, with bicalutamide as comparator. despite that disease stage was a stratification 
 factor, the value of this study is clearly limited, since the prognosis in the subset of m0 seemed better 
 than in the pivotal trial (few patients in high risk of developing metastasis).</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>in the prosper trial, a total of 254 study sites in 32 countries in north and south america, europe, australia, new zealand, and asia randomized patients. the highest enrolling countries were australia 
 (136 patients, 9.7%), us (105 patients, 7.5%), brazil (104 patients, 7.4%), france (103 patients,</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 50/90 
 7.4%), and canada (99 patients, 7.1%). subgroups analysis according to geographic region did not reveal any important differences. 
 the participant flow does no show important concerns and the majority of patients on treatment at the 
 date of the data cutoff, belong to the enzalutamide arm (68% vs 38%). approximately half of the 
 patients at screening were not randomized. 
 the study was amended three times. the most important consequence of these amendments was the 
 disconnection between the final mfs and final os. this change was apparently driven by the results 
 from the study mdv3100-09 (strive study) along with studies mdv3100-03 and 9785-cl-0222. 
 better outcomes than expected from these ones related to mfs, led the mah to decouple os and mfs. 
 a total of 78 patients (5.6%) (54 [5.8%] in the enzalutamide group and 24 [5.1%] in the placebo 
 group) had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study. however, percentages of major 
 protocol deviations seem to be evenly balanced between arms and no important biases have been 
 identified. 
 the baseline characteristics point out that the majority of patients had a baseline ecog performance 
 status 0 (80.6%) and psa dt &lt;6 months (76.8%). the median psa dt was 3.7 months (range: 0.4 to 
 71.8 months) across treatment groups. more than half of patients had previously received 2 or more 
 prior hormonal therapies in addition to their primary treatment for prostate cancer prior to study entry. 
 the median age at randomization was 74.0 years in the enzalutamide group and 73.0 years in the 
 placebo group. despite the inclusion criteria, 2.6% of patients were considered metastatic. however, 
 these patients were censored at randomization in the primary mfs analysis and its sensitivity analyses. 
 in any case, due to the small number, no great impact is expected on the results. 
 results from prosper trial in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 28-june-
 2016 included the main analysis planned for mfs (birc assessed) and the first interim analysis for os 
 (2 ia planned plus 1 final analysis). 
 with an event rate of 23.5% and 48.7% for enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically 
 significant improvement in mfs was observed for enzalutamide compared to placebo (hr: 0.292; 95% 
 ci: 0.241, 0.352). the median mfs (95% ci) was 36.6 months (95% ci: 33.1, nr) in the 
 enzalutamide group and 14.7 months (95% ci: 14.2, 15.0) in the placebo group (δ 21.9 months). a 
 reduction in both bone metastases and soft tissue metastases was observed among patients treated 
 with enzalutamide compared to placebo.</p><p>
 these results are supported by several sensitivity analyses as 
 well as by subgroups analyses. 
 overall, key secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. treatment with 
 enzalutamide delayed time to psa progression (hr=0.066; 95% ci: 0.054, 0.081) and time to first 
 use of new antineoplastic treatment (hr:0.208; 95% ci: 0.168, 0.258). os data, still highly immature 
 at the time of the first ia so as to draw any firm conclusion (event rate 11% and 13.2% in 
 enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively), did not cross the boundary for statistical significance 
 (hr=0.795, 95% ci: 0.580, 1.089) and no clear separation of the survival curves is observed, 
 however there is no indication of a detrimental effect, which is reassuring. this remains to be further 
 confirmed (see efficacy conclusions). 
 other secondary efficacy endpoints included to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit (need for 
 first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival, chemotherapy-
 free survival) though still rather immature in some cases, all supported primary efficacy results but 
 time to pain progression (hr=0.959; 95% ci: 0.801, 0.1.149), the latter maybe due to the fact that 
 patients were nonmetastatic at study entry, and therefore were without pain from prostate cancer, and 
 collection of the bpi-sf was discontinued at the time of radiographic progression.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 51/90 
 enzalutamide has shown both in the pre-chemotherapy mildly symptomatic setting and in post-chemotherapy stage to increase the life expectancy. however, this longer survival has not been shown 
 yet in the new setting of m0 crpc (updated os are expected). the delay in the onset of metastases 
 does represent a benefit from an individual patient perspective, which is accompanied by a psa 
 response (see sag discussion). a direct consequence of these effects is to postpone the use of 
 antineoplastic treatment, which will likely mean to postpone the introduction of new hormonal 
 therapies (e.g. abiraterone) and to a lesser extent the use of docetaxel. in fact, the most common 
 postbaseline antineoplastic therapy was endocrine therapy (18.0% enzalutamide and 39.8% placebo), 
 of which abiraterone was the most common generic name medication (7.0% and 27.7%), followed by 
 leuprorelin (5.3% enzalutamide and 4.5% placebo) and bicalutamide (1.6% enzalutamide and 6.2% 
 placebo). docetaxel was used by 7.7% vs 20.2% (enzalutamide arms vs placebo respectively). due to 
 the blinding rules, the treatment for the study participants was blinded until cut-off date, june 2017. 
 enzalutamide was approved for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic crpc 
 since october 2014. this means that patients in the control arm did not receive enzulatmide after 
 progression, which would have been more in line with current standards. the pivotal trial does not 
 allow establishing if enzalutamide given before or after progression provides greatest benefit to 
 patients (see below). 
 splitting the cause of death between disease progression and other causes, showed that a higher 
 percentage of deaths on the placebo group were to disease progression as judged by investigators, 
 16.7%, as compared to 11.1% in the enzalutamide group. however, the percentage of deaths due to 
 other causes was higher in the enzalutamide group, 8.6%, compared to 5.6% in the placebo group. 
 these differences in deaths due to other causes could be a consequence of the fact that since patients 
 receiving enzalutamide had fewer deaths due to prostate cancer, the likelihood of dying of other 
 causes and comorbidities was higher. however, these analyses are marred by competing risks and can 
 be considered, at best, hypothesis generating. further long-term efficacy data are expected in order to 
 shed light on that (see efficacy conlcusions). 
 treatment with enzalutamide did not show a significant difference in quality of life. 
 earlier use of hormonal therapies could impede their efficacy in the metastatic setting, which would 
 pose uncertainties about the right sequence and the consequence of that in terms of mechanism of 
 resistance. pfs2 could partially answer this question, although not included in the design of the 
 prosper study. references submitted (bono et at, 2017 and spartan study) to resolve this issue did 
 not provide enough evidence. additionally, the present study was not designed to unravel uncertainties 
 about the best possible sequence for enzalutamide treatment. neither was the study to show the 
 benefit of early versus deferred therapy, i.e. to initiate therapy at the non-metastatic stage versus at 
 time of metastases. consequently, this cannot be considered clarified with available data. the relative 
 benefit of early versus late use of enzalutamide remains unknown.</p></section><section><header>additional expert consultation</header><p>a sag-o meeting was held on september the 6th. the sag oncology was invited to provide its opinion on the following points:</p></section><section><header n="1">1. do you consider that presently available data are sufficient to demonstrate the clinical benefit of xtandi in the sought indication, given the absence of documented symptomatic 
 benefit and absence of mature overall survival results?</header><p>the effect of enzalutamide in the sought indication is of clear statistical significance. such an effect is also clinically significant because it is reasonable to assume that postponing the onset of metastasis by 
 21.9 months (the observed difference in median metastasis-free survival, mfs, between the</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 52/90 
 experimental and control arm in the pivotal trial) is associated with a delaying of symptoms and worsening of quality of life, and delaying the need for subsequent treatments in the metastatic settings 
 (and associated anxiety in view of the worse prognosis and likely higher toxicity). the results in terms 
 of mfs are corroborated by a trend showing a favourable effect on overall survival (os), other 
 secondary endpoints, and the effect of enzalutamide in the metastatic setting. the effect of 
 enzalutamide has been consistent across endpoints and stages of the disease in different randomized 
 trials. mfs has been validated as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival in an earlier setting (xie et 
 al. 2017), which is supportive evidence even acknowledging the different settings and results of the 
 pivotal trial (i.e., the relatively small difference in os compared to mfs). the toxicity associated with 
 enzalutamide (grade &gt;3 aes: 31.4% v. 23.4% for enzalutamide v. placebo, respectively) did not raise 
 particular concerns, as also shown by the low rate of treatment discontinuation (&lt;10% due to 
 toxicity). no significant detriment was observed in quality of life compared to placebo. thus, the sag 
 concluded that the clinical benefit has been established based on reasonable assumptions and 
 supportive evidence. this clinical benefit was confirmed from a patient perspective. 
 however, some sag members took issue with the lack of a demonstrated effect in terms of quality of 
 life or os, the lack of long-term follow-up data (including patient-reported outcomes after progression 
 and the objective effects after censoring for the primary endpoint mfs; e.g. pfs 2 like data (response 
 and duration of such therapies). in addition, it would have been of value to have long-term follow-up 
 data on this earlier introduction of enzalutamide in the sequence of currently available treatments. 
 without having studied the optimal sequence in terms of long-term outcomes leaves a number of 
 uncertainties that make clinical decisions difficult. although the trend in os appeared reassuring, 
 further studies would have to determine the clinical usefulness of enzalutamide before v. after 
 evidence of metastasis and symptomatic disease, as well as how early treatment with enzalutamide in 
 the non-metastatic setting fits in the sequence with other agents used in clinical practice according to 
 today’s standards. thus, long-term follow-up at regular interval should be mandated post-approval and 
 further studies are needed to determine optimal sequencing of available treatments. until further data 
 are available, the value of enzalutamide prior to onset of metastases will be difficult to establish.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what is the clinical relevance of a gain in the metastasis-free-survival per se in the setting of non-metastatic crpc?</header><p>mfs is assumed to be associated with a delaying of symptoms and worsening of quality of life, and deferring the need for subsequent treatments in the metastatic settings (and associated anxiety in 
 view of the worse prognosis and likely higher toxicity). all these assumptions are considered quite 
 reasonable given the natural history of the disease, the available therapeutic options in the metastatic 
 setting, and the available supportive data (see answer to question no. 1). in the absence of 
 detrimental toxicity or marked decrease in quality of life due to treatment before development of 
 metastases, delaying metastatic disease can be a valid objective of therapy, shared by both patients 
 and physicians. 
 these assumptions are difficult to test due to the fact that measuring quality of life and other events is 
 problematic after progression and likely switch to different treatments off-trial. still, the need for long-
 term follow-up not just for os but as much as possible also for symptoms and quality of life cannot be 
 over-emphasized for future drug-developments in this setting.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.

 a post-authorisation efficacy study (paes) in order to investigate the long-term effects of enzalutamide 
 on overall survival and relevant secondary endpoints in adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
 castration-resistant prostate cancer. the mah should submit the results of the mdv3100-14

 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>the safety profile of enzalutamide in support of its use for the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) is based primarily on the results of the 
 pivotal study mdv3100-14 (prosper), a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
 controlled study in patients with nonmetastatic crpc at high risk of disease progression based on 
 rising prostate-specific antigen (psa) and psa doubling time.</p><p>
 in addition to study mdv3100-14, the safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with either 
 nonmetastatic or metastatic crpc is derived from the following clinical studies involving 5464 patients: 
 • two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc (mdv3100-03 [prevail] and 9785-cl-0232 [asian prevail]). in study 
 9785-cl-0232, data from site 105 was excluded due to data quality. 
 • one randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients with metastatic crpc previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (crpc2 [affirm]). 
 • two randomized, bicalutamide-controlled, phase 2 studies in patients with metastatic crpc (9785-cl-0222 [terrain]) and with nonmetastatic or metastatic crpc (mdv3100-09 
 [strive]). in the study mdv3100-09, 197 patients were treated with enzalutamide (69 
 nonmetastatic and 128 metastatic) and 198 received bicalutamide (69 nonmetastatic and 129 
 metastatic). 
 together these studies include 3179 patients treated with enzalutamide plus standard of care that 
 make up the integrated safety population. of the 3179 enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated 
 safety population, a total of 999 patients (31.4%) had nonmetastatic crpc and 2180 patients (68.6%) 
 had metastatic crpc; 2379 patients (74.8%) did not receive prior docetaxel and were considered 
 chemotherapy-naïve and 800 patients (25.2%) had more advanced metastatic crpc that was 
 previously treated with docetaxel (or another cytotoxic chemotherapy). the dose of enzalutamide in all 
 studies was 160 mg/day orally

 convulsion (seizure) 
 teaes of convulsion (seizure) were reported in 3 patients (0.3%) in the enzalutamide group and no 
 patient in the placebo group. all 3 convulsions in the enzalutamide group were considered serious and 
 drug-related, and occurred within 180 days of initiating study drug. one convulsion led to study drug

 posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) pres is a rare neurological disorder that requires confirmation by brain imaging. pres has been 
 considered an adr based on 2 post-marketing cases. 
 no cases of pres were identified in study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies, the total enzalutamide, 
 placebo or bicalutamide groups. 
 the ‘noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium’ smq (narrow) was used to search for potential events of 
 pres. the following events were reported for 5 (0.5%) patients in the enzalutamide group of study 
 mdv3100-14 within the noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium smq: delirium (n = 3, 0.3%), 
 encephalopathy (n = 1, 0.1%) and leukoencephalopathy (n = 1, 0.1%). the only patients in any study 
 who had an event within the noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium smq leading to death were in the 
 placebo group of the phase 3 studies (n = 3, 0.2%) and in bicalutamide group of the phase 2 studies 
 (n = 1, 0.3%). no patients in any of the enzalutamide-treated groups had an event of potential pres 
 that led to death. 
 cognitive and memory impairment 
 the incidence of teaes involving impaired cognition and memory (terms within the meddra high level 
 group term ‘mental impairment disorders’) in the study mdv3100-14 was higher in the enzalutamide 
 group compared with the placebo group (5.2% vs. 1.9%).</p><p>
 the most frequent preferred terms reported were memory impairment (18 patients [1.9%] in the 
 enzalutamide group vs. 4 patients [0.9%] in the placebo group) and disturbance in attention (15 
 patients [1.6%] in the enzalutamide group vs. 1 patient [0.2%] in the placebo group). a total of 28 
 patients (3.0%) in the enzalutamide group and 5 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group were 
 considered to have a teae that was related to study drug. when events were adjusted for duration on 
 treatment (events per 100 patient-years), the overall event rates were 3.8 in the enzalutamide group 
 and 1.8 in the placebo group. 
 the incidence of any event of cognitive and memory impairment in the enzalutamide group of study 
 mdv3100-14 was similar to the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and to the total 
 enzalutamide group (5.2%, 4.9% and 4.9%). teaes of cognitive and memory impairment did not lead 
 to any deaths for patients in any treatment group. 
 saes of cognitive and memory impairment and grade ≥ 3 cognitive and memory impairment events 
 were low overall (≤ 1.0%) across the majority of all treatment groups. in the study mdv3100-14 only 
 1 patient in the enzalutamide group and no patient in the placebo group experienced a grade 3 or 
 higher teaes of ‘mental impairment’ (the event was a grade 3 cognitive disorder that led to study 
 drug discontinuation). the incidence of teaes of cognitive and memory impairment leading to dose 
 interruption in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 was also low and similar to that in the 
 enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies (0.3% vs. 0.2%). the same is true for the teaes leading to 
 dose reduction (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and teaes as the primary reason for discontinuation (0.2% vs. 
 0.3%).</p></section><section><header>table 33.</header><p> treatment-emergent adverse events of cognitive and memory impairment</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 placebo group in study mdv3100-14 (41.4% vs. 20.2%) as well as in the phase 3 studies (45.2% vs. 
 31.5%). the incidence of any event of fatigue in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 was 
 lower than the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (41.4% 
 vs. 45.2% and 44.3%). 
 the most common teae preferred terms contributing to fatigue-related events were fatigue and 
 asthenia. the proportion of patients with the preferred term of fatigue was similar in the enzalutamide 
 groups of study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (32.6%, 32.7% 
 and 32.7%). in both study mdv3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the incidence of fatigue was higher 
 in enzalutamide groups compared with their respective placebo groups (32.6% vs. 13.8% and 32.7% 
 vs. 21.7%). when adjusted for the length of treatment, the event rate per 100 patient-years of fatigue 
 was higher in the enzalutamide group as compared with the placebo group of study mdv3100-14 
 (22.9 vs. 13.1) and lower in the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies compared with placebo

 mdv3100-14 was lower than the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total 
 enzalutamide group (0.9% vs. 1.4% and 1.4%). 
 the most frequent teaes of neutrophil count decreased were neutropenia and neutrophil count

 higher in the enzalutamide group compared with placebo group (0.6% vs.. 0.2% and 0.8% vs.. 0.3%). 
 the incidence of neutropenia in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 was similar compared 
 with the phase studies 3 and the total enzalutamide group (0.6%, 0.8% and 0.8%). 
 neutrophil count decreased was the next most common preferred term. the incidence of neutrophil 
 count decreased events was low and comparable in the enzalutamide groups of study mdv3100-14,

 fall 
 overall, the incidence of teaes of fall was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
 group of both study mdv3100-14 (11.4% vs. 4.1%) and the phase 3 studies (9.1% vs. 3.6%). the 
 incidence of fall in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 was higher than in the enzalutamide 
 group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (11.4%, 9.1% and 9.3%). when 
 adjusted for treatment duration, the event rate per 100 patient-years of fall was higher in the 
 enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 compared with the placebo group (9.5 vs. 4.1). the event 
 rate of fall in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 was similar to the event rates in the 
 enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (9.5, 9.1 and 9.4). 
 in general, the incidence of saes of fall was low and similar among the enzalutamide groups of study 
 mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (0.8%, 0.6% and 0.6%), as well 
 as the incidence of grade ≥ 3 events (1.3%, 1.0% and 1.0%). there were no events of fall as the 
 primary reason for discontinuation in study mdv3100-14 or in the phase 3 studies. no deaths were 
 associated with teaes of fall in any treatment group across the studies. 
 the incidence of fall increased with age. in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 the 
 proportion of patients with an event of fall was 7.4% in patients &lt; 75 years and 15.8% in patients ≥ 
 75 years. a similar pattern was observed in the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group.</p><p>
 an exploratory analysis of teaes of syncope-related events (syncope, presyncope, loss of 
 consciousness, dizziness and postural dizziness) reported within 1 day prior to teaes of fall was 
 performed to evaluate the possible association of syncope-related events with fall. among patients 
 with fall, a similar proportion in the enzalutamide and placebo groups had 1 or more syncope-related 
 events within 1 day prior to a fall (5.7% [6/106] vs. 5.3% [1/19] in study mdv3100-14; 3.5% 
 [9/256] vs. 2.9% [2/69] in the phase 3 studies). among the 106 enzalutamide-treated patients with a 
 teae of fall in study mdv3100-14, 4 patients (3.8%) had dizziness, 1 patient had syncope (0.9%) and 
 1 patient had a presyncope event (0.9%) within 1 day prior to the teae of fall. among the 256 
 enzalutamide-treated patients with a teae of fall in phase 3 studies, 6 patients (2.3%) reported 
 dizziness, 2 patients had syncope (0.8%) and 1 patient had a presyncope event (0.4%) within 1 day 
 prior to the teae of fall. 
 there were no enzalutamide-treated patients with postural dizziness or loss of consciousness reported 
 within 1 day prior to a teae of fall in study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies or the total 
 enzalutamide group. 
 fractures 
 the events of fractures have been previously reported in patients treated with enzalutamide. in the 
 study mdv3100-14 a higher incidence of fractures was reported in the enzalutamide group compared 
 with the placebo group (11.2% vs. 5.6%). the most common types of fracture reported among the 
 enzalutamide groups of study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and total enzalutamide group were rib 
 fracture (4.2%, 2.4% and 2.5%), followed by spinal compression fracture (1.8%, 1.2% and 1.2%), 
 femur fracture (0.5%, 0.4% and 0.3%) and upper limb fracture (0.5%, 0.3% and 0.3%). 
 when adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates per 100 patient-years of fracture was higher in 
 the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 (9.5 vs. 5.1) and in the enzalutamide groups of the 
 phase 3 studies (8.1 vs. 4.8) compared to placebo.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 in general, the incidences of saes of fractures were low and similar among the enzalutamide groups of study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (2.8%, 2.9% and 3.0%), as 
 were grade ≥ 3 events of fracture (2.4%, 2.6% and 2.7%) and any event of fracture as the primary 
 reason for discontinuation (0.2%, 0.1% and 0.1 %). one event of fracture, occurring in an 
 enzalutamide-treated patient in study mdv3100-14, led to a fatal outcome due to complications of 
 fracture.</p><p>
 the incidence of fractures increased with the length of treatment duration, with the majority of 
 fractures reported after 180 days of study treatment. 
 syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness and postural dizziness 
 saes, grade ≥ 3 teaes and teaes as the primary reason for discontinuation were uncommon for 
 events of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness and postural dizziness in study 
 mdv3100-14 and in the phase 3 studies.</p><p>
 the incidence and/or event rates of syncope, loss of consciousness and postural dizziness were similar 
 between the enzalutamide and placebo groups in study mdv3100-14 and in the phase 3 studies.</p><p>
 the incidence of presyncope was low, but higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
 in study mdv3100-14 (1.0% vs. 0) and in the phase 3 studies (1.0% vs. 0.2%).</p><p>
 in study mdv3100-14, the incidence of dizziness was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with 
 the placebo group (9.8% vs. 4.3%) with event rates of 7.2 vs. 4.9. in the phase 3 studies, the 
 incidence of dizziness was also higher in the enzalutamide group (8.6% vs. 5.4%), however event 
 rates adjusted for duration of treatment were lower in the enzalutamide group (7.7 vs. 8.5). 
 no enzalutamide-treated patients died due to a teae of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, 
 dizziness or postural dizziness. 
 an exploratory analysis of teaes of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness and postural 
 dizziness reported within 1 day prior to fall teaes does not suggest an association of these events with 
 falls among enzalutamide-treated patients. 
 hypertension 
 hypertension is a known adverse event related to enzalutamide treatment and already described in 
 previous studies. in the study mdv3100-14 the incidence hypertension was higher in the enzalutamide 
 group compared with the placebo group (12.3% vs. 5.4%) as it was in the phase 3 studies (11.3% vs. 
 4.3%).</p><p>
 when adjusted for treatment duration, the event rate for hypertension was higher in enzalutamide 
 groups compared with the placebo group in both study mdv3100-14 (8.4 vs. 5.1) and phase 3 studies 
 (9.4 vs. 5.7). the incidence of any event of hypertension was comparable in the enzalutamide group of 
 study mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (12.3%, 11.3% and 
 11.7%). 
 teaes of hypertension leading to death were not reported in any treatment group. in study mdv3100-
 14, 1 enzalutamide-treated patient experienced an event of grade 4 hypertension. 
 overall the incidence of saes of hypertension was low and similar in the enzalutamide groups of study 
 mdv3100-14, the phase 3 studies and in the total enzalutamide group (0.3%, 0.3% and 0.4%). 
 similar trends were reported for grade ≥ 3 teaes (4.6%, 4.8% and 5.1%). the incidence of teaes of 
 hypertension as the primary reason for study drug discontinuation was low for the enzalutamide 
 groups in study mdv3100-14 and the phase 3 studies (0.1%). teaes of hypertension leading to dose</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 interruption or dose reduction were more frequent in the enzalutamide groups in study mdv3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, compared with their respective placebo group. 
 the incidence of hypertension was similar in enzalutamide-treated patients with and without history of 
 hypertension and were higher compared with those in the placebo groups (12.1% vs.. 5.0% in patients 
 with prior history of hypertension and 11.7% vs. 5.6% in patients without hypertension history).</p><p>
 overall, the incidence of events of hypertension in study mdv3100-14 was similar to the incidence 
 observed in enzalutamide-treated patients in prior studies with less than 1.0% events being reported 
 as 
 saes, approximately 5% of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 events and permanent discontinuations 
 from study treatment due to hypertension were rare. 
 selected cardiovascular events 
 in study mdv3100-14, 5.2% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 2.8% of patients in the 
 placebo group experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (mace). mace included a composite 
 of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular teaes based on narrow smqs of ‘myocardial infarction’, ‘cardiac 
 failure’, haemorrhagic cerebrovascular conditions’, and ‘ischaemic cerebrovascular conditions’. 
 the mace rates (events per 100 patient-years) were 4.1 vs. 2.9 in the enzalutamide and placebo 
 groups.</p><p>
 grade 3 or higher mace occurred in 34 of 48 patients (70.8%) in the enzalutamide group and 8 of 13 
 patients (61.5%) in the placebo group. the majority of grade 3 or higher mace occurred after 365 
 days. in both treatment groups, the majority of mace was assessed as serious (36 of 48 patients in 
 the enzalutamide group and 8 of 13 patients in the placebo group). 
 in study mdv3100-14, mace incidence was similar for the enzalutamide group compared with the 
 placebo group in days 1 to 30 (0.2% vs. 0) and days 181 to 365 (1.1% vs. 1.1%), but was higher in 
 the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group for days 31 to 180 (1.2% vs. 0.4%) and &gt; 
 365 days (4.5% vs. 3.8%). in the phase 3 studies, mace incidence was similar for the enzalutamide 
 group compared with the placebo group across all discrete time periods (0.3% vs. 0.2% for days 1 to 
 30; 1.4% vs. 1.2% for days 31 to 180; 1.6% vs. 1.3% for days 181 to 365 and 3.3% vs. 3.2% for &gt; 
 365 days). 
 to further characterize a treatment group imbalance in mace observed in study mdv3100-14, an 
 additional composite, designated as antiplatelet trialists’ collaboration (aptc) mace (vascular death, 
 nonfatal mi, and nonfatal cerebrovascular accident) was included.</p><p>
 in study mdv3100-14, 4.2% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 2.2% of patients in the 
 placebo group experienced an aptc mace. the aptc mace rates (events per 100 patient-years) were 
 3.3 vs. 2.3 in the enzalutamide and placebo groups. 
 in study mdv3100-14, the enzalutamide group had aptc mace incidence of 0.2% in days 1 to 30 
 compared with no events in the placebo group. the aptc mace incidence was higher in the 
 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group between days 31 to 180 (0.7% vs. 0.2%), days 
 181 to 365 (1.3% vs. 0.6%) and &gt; 365 days (3.7% vs. 3.3%). in the phase 3 studies (study 
 mdv3100-14 pooled with the other 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies), 
 aptc mace incidence was similar for the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group across 
 all discrete time periods (0.2% vs. 0.2% for days 1 to 30; 1.0% vs. 1.1% for days 31 to 180; 1.2% 
 vs. 1.0% for days 181 to 365; 2.7% vs. 2.5% for &gt; 365 days).</p></section><section><header>table 35.</header><p> selected treatment-emergent cardiovascular events –mace</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 second primary malignancies 
 overall, the incidence of second primary malignancies was higher in the enzalutamide group of study 
 mdv3100-14 compared with the placebo group (2.9% vs. 1.1%). in the phase 3 studies, the incidence 
 of any second primary malignancy was also higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the 
 placebo group (2.4% vs. 0.9%). the incidence of any second primary malignancy in the enzalutamide 
 group of study mdv3100-14 was similar to the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and to the 
 total enzalutamide group (2.9% vs. 2.4% and 2.5%). 
 after adjustment for length of treatment duration, second primary malignancy event rates per 100 
 patient-years were higher for the enzalutamide-treated patients compared with the placebo groups in 
 study mdv3100-14 (2.1 vs. 1.0) and the phase 3 studies (2.0 vs. 1.4). 
 the most common second primary malignancies in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 were 
 adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.5%), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (0.2%), bladder cancer (0.2%) 
 and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%). all other reported second primary malignancies in the 
 enzalutamide group had only 1 reported teae (by preferred term).</p><p>
 the proportion of patients in the enzalutamide group of study mdv3100-14 with a second primary 
 malignancy that lead to death (0.5%) was slightly higher than in placebo group (0.2%) and the same

 serious teaes considered related to study drug occurred in 3.4% of patients in the enzalutamide group 
 and 2.6% in the placebo group. 
 the proportion of study-drug-related treatment emergent saes in the mdv3100-14 enzalutamide

 in both treatment groups, a high proportion of patients with serious teaes occurred in the soc 
 cardiac disorders (4.8% in the enzalutamide group vs. 2.4% in the placebo group). 
 when adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates for these treatment-emergent saes showed a 
 pattern of reversal of the differences in incidences between the phase 3 enzalutamide and placebo 
 groups for pneumonia (1.1 enzalutamide vs. 1.1 placebo), anemia (1.4 vs. 2.4), general physical

 patients with metastatic crpc who had received prior docetaxel) and 9785-cl-0232 (asian prevail) 
 and data from two phase ii, bicalutamide-controlled studies (9785-cl-0222 [terrain] and mdv3100-
 09 [strive]).</p><p>
 in the study mdv3100-14 the median duration of treatment was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide 
 group compared with 11.1 months for the placebo group, thus a higher rate of adverse events would 
 be expectable with enzalutamide. a similar proportion of patients (33 %) received study drug in the 
 ≥12 and &lt; 24 months range in the respective arms however a higher proportion of enzalutamide 
 treated patients (35%) received study drug for ≥ 24 months compared with the placebo group (13 %). 
 the exposure was shorter for the other phase iii studies compared with study mdv3100-14 likely due 
 to these patients experiencing more advanced disease. 
 the population included in the study mdv3100-14 was well balanced between treatment groups. it 
 encompasses patients with a median age of 74 years (47.5% of patients were 75 years or older), with 
 nonmetastatic disease (97%) and a good performance status (baseline ecog 0 in 80% of patients and 
 ecog 1 in 19.9% of patients). approximately 21% of enzalutamide-treated patients had medical 
 history of hypertension. patients with past history of seizure or conditions that predispose to an 
 increased risk of seizure, creatinine values &gt; 2 mg/dl, unacceptable haematology values, liver 
 chemistry tests more than twice the upper limit of normal (uln) or any clinically significant 
 cardiovascular disease were excluded. 
 overall, the incidence of teaes was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
 group (86.9% vs. 77.4%, respectively) with the most commonly reported teaes (≥ 5% of patients) 
 being fatigue (32.6% vs. 13.8%), hot flush (13.0% vs. 7.7%), hypertension (11.9% vs. 5.2%), 
 nausea (11.4% vs. 8.6%), fall (11.4% vs. 4.1%), dizziness (9.8% vs. 4.3%), decreased appetite 
 (9.6% vs. 3.9%), constipation (9.1% vs. 6.9%), headache (9.1% vs. 4.5%), asthenia (8.8% vs. 
 6.0%) and weight decreased (5.9% vs. 1.5%). when adjusted for the duration of treatment, 
 differences versus placebo were reduced; fatigue, decreased appetite and hypertension remained 
 higher in the enzalutamide group (≥ 2% higher incidence compared to placebo). in general, a lower 
 incidence of teaes was reported in the pivotal study as compared to the integrated data sets. 
 teaes considered by the investigator to be drug-related were reported in 62.4% of patients treated 
 with enzalutamide and 45.4% of patients in the placebo group. of these, fatigue, decreased appetite,</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 hypertension, weight decreased, dizziness and dysgeusia were at least twice more frequently reported in the enzalutamide arm. 
 grade 3 or higher aes were reported in 31.4% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared to 
 23.4% in the placebo arm. hypertension (4.6% enzalutamide vs. 2.2% placebo), fatigue (2.9% vs. 
 0.6%), syncope (1.1% vs. 0.4%), fall (1.3% vs. 0.6%), asthenia (1.2% vs. 0.2%) and pneumonia 
 (1.1% vs. 0.4%) were grade≥ 3 aes more frequent (≥ 0.5% higher incidence) in the enzalutamide 
 group than in the placebo group. 
 aes considered of special interest reported during study mdv3100-14 include seizure, cognitive and 
 memory impairment, neutrophil count decreased, hypertension, fatigue, select cardiovascular events, 
 hepatic impairment, second primary malignancies, falls, fractures, syncope and renal impairment. 
 these were selected based on previously recognised important identified risks and/or feedback from 
 regulatory authorities recommending surveillance. 
 in the enzalutamide group 3 patients (0.3%) experienced a seizure, which were considered by the 
 investigator as possibly related to study drug. no patient in the placebo group reported any event of 
 seizure. in the combined enzalutamide group, 13 (0.4%) events were reported (relevant warning 
 reflected in smpc).</p><p>
 the incidence of teaes of any event of neutrophil count decreased was higher in enzalutamide treated 
 patients compared to placebo (mdv3100-14: 0.9% vs. 0.2%; phase iii studies: 1.4% vs 0.6%). in the 
 total enzalutamide group the proportion was 1.4 %, none fatal. the incidences were low for serious 
 teaes (0.1 %), grade 
 ≥</p><p>3 events (0.7 %) and as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation (0.1 %). dose interruptions and dose reductions due to neutrophil count decreased were 0.2 % and 
 0.1 % in the total enzalutamide dataset, respectively. there were no reports of cases of febrile neutropenia. of the nine patients reported with teaes of neutropenia, two cases were identified with 
 concurrent infections. one case with cough grade 1 (day 286) which did not result in either 
 hospitalisation or discontinuation from study (discontinuation subsequently occurred on day 409 due 
 to pd) and a second patient that had what seems like a transient event of neutropenia grade 1 during 
 which time he experienced and was treated for a herpes zoster infection (no action was taken in terms 
 of study drug).</p><p>
 major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) were reported in a higher number of patients in the 
 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (5.2% vs. 2.8%, respectively) and so did grade 
 3 or higher mace. when adjusted for treatment duration, those differences remained higher in the enzalutamide arm (4.1 vs. 2.9) although in line with data from previous phase 3 studies. in patients 
 with baseline history of cardiovascular disease event rates were slightly higher (9.9 enzalutamide and 
 8.6 placebo vs. 2.6 enzalutamide and 1.5 placebo). hypertension is a common adverse event of enzalutamide, reflected in the smpc. in study mdv3100-
 14 hypertension was reported in 12.3% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared with 5.4% of patients that received placebo. no differences were observed in the incidence of hypertension 
 according to baseline history of hypertension (12.1% history of hypertension vs. 11.7% no history of 
 hypertension). 
 fatigue and asthenia are common adverse events related to enzalutamide treatment. in study 
 mdv300-14 fatigue was reported in 32.6% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared with 
 13.8% with placebo. additionally, fatigue is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer, so 
 a lower incidence would be expected in patients with nonmetastatic disease. in contrast, the incidence 
 of fatigue in study mdv300-14, in patients with no metastatic disease and a better performance status, 
 was similar to that reported in previous phase iii trials in patients with metastatic disease.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 78/90 
 adverse events of fractures were reported in 11.2% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared to 5.5% with placebo. the incidence increases with the longer exposure to study treatment. similar 
 proportions were observed in the combined phase iii safety dataset (10.2% vs. 4.4%) as well as in 
 the enzalutamide group (10.3%). a similar difference between enzalutamide and placebo remained 
 when adjusted for treatment duration all through the presented safety datasets. this is reflected in the 
 smpc. 
 most commonly types of fracture reported in enzalutamide treated patients in the mdv3100-14 were 
 rib fracture (4.2%), spinal compression fracture (1.8%), femur fracture (0.5%) and upper limb 
 fracture (0.5%). the study protocol did not include a required assessment of fractures as “non-
 pathological” vs. “pathological”, therefore the proportion of pathological vs. non-pathological fractures 
 in enzalutamide vs. placebo treated patients cannot be reliably elucidated. 
 the incidence of fall was higher in the enzalutamide treated patients compared to placebo (106 
 [11.4%] vs. 19 [4.1%]). this was also observed when adjusting for treatment duration (9.5% vs. 
 4.1%). a post-hoc analysis revealed that 51/106 patients in the enzalutamide group and 10/19 in the 
 placebo arm experienced a fracture within two days of a reported fall. thus, 49% of patients that 
 reported a fracture in the enzalutamide arm and 38.5% in the placebo arm had suffer from a previous 
 fall.</p><p>
 a higher incidence of second primary malignancies, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, was 
 reported in the enzalutamide group compared to the placebo group (2.9% vs. 1.1%, respectively). 
 when adjusted for treatment duration, event rates per 100 patient-year remained higher in the 
 enzalutamide group (2.1 enzalutamide vs. 1.0 placebo). similar data have been reported in patients 
 treated with enzalutamide in the phase iii studies (2.4% vs. 0.9%) and in the total enzalutamide 
 group (2.5%). second primary malignancies were reported across a variety of different organ systems 
 and cell types. a total of five patients in the integrated safety population were identified with second 
 primary malignancies considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably drug-related. however, 
 no obvious mechanistic rationale for androgen receptor inhibition to cause specifically these 
 malignancies can be established. enzalutamide has shown to be carcinogenic in non clinical trials. the 
 relevance of these findings in humans is unknown, but the potential risk of enzalutamide to develop 
 second primary malignancies cannot be ruled out (see 5.3 of smpc). furthermore, due to the non-
 clinical findings related to urinary bladder carcinogenicity of enzalutamide, a signal will be triggered to 
 further study these pre-clinical findings and relevance for human use. 
 for both renal and hepatic impairment the incidences were lower in the enzalutamide arm as 
 compared to placebo in the pivotal study (renal impairment 1.7% vs. 4.1%; hepatic impairment 1.2% 
 vs. 1.9%). no hy’s law cases were identified. one fatality due to renal impairment occurred in the 
 mdv3100-14 study not deemed related to study drug. it is to be noted that patients with advanced 
 renal or hepatic impairment were not eligible into the mdv3100-1334 study.</p><p>
 the incidence of saes in the enzalutamide group was higher than in the placebo group (24.3% vs. 
 18.3%), although only in 3.4% of patients that received enzalutamide saes were considered related to 
 study drug by the investigator. in addition, differences between treatment arms were driven mainly by 
 the higher number of saes reported in the enzalutamide group after one year of treatment compared 
 to placebo (106 [11.4%] enzalutamide vs. 24 [5.2%] placebo). in the enzalutamide group, hematuria 
 and pneumonia were the only saes reported in ≥ 1%. saes reported in a higher percentage of 
 patients in the enzalutamide group (incidence ≥0.5% or double) were pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, 
 fall, cardiac failure myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. 
 as of the data cutoff, 103 (11.0%) and 62 (13.2%) patients had died in the enzalutamide and placebo 
 y group, respectively. the majority of deaths were due to disease progression (5.4% enzalutamide vs.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/41918/2019</p><p>
 page 79/90 
 9.7% placebo). a higher number of deaths were related to aes in the enzalutamide group compared to placebo group (32 [3.4%] enzalutamide vs. 3 [0.6%] placebo), with myocardial infarction as the main 
 ae resulting in death in the enzalutamide arm. additionally, there were 3 deaths of unknown cause in 
 the enzalutamide group and a higher number of deaths occurred within 30 days after discontinuation 
 of study drug. 
 regarding safety in special populations, no important safety issues have been identified. according to 
 baseline weight (≤ median vs. &gt; median) the incidence of aes, saes and ≥ 3 aes appear similar 
 between groups (data not shown). aes were analysed per age group, &lt; 65 years (13.0%), 65 to 74 
 years (39.5%) and ≥ 75 years (47.5%). the frequency of aes of any grade, aes of grade ≥ 3, and 
 saes increased with each age group but it is expectable due do the increased sensitivity for aes with 
 increasing age.</p><p>
 patients with baseline history of hypertension, reported a higher incidence of aes of any grade (88.9% 
 history of hypertension vs. 83.7% no history of hypertension), saes (27.1% vs. 20.1%) and aes of 
 grade ≥ 3 (34.6% vs. 26.6%) compared to patients without baseline history of hypertension and 
 compared to patients that received placebo. within saes and grade ≥ 3 aes, a higher incidence of 
 cardiac disorders was reported in patients with a baseline history of hypertension compared to those 
 without previous history of hypertension (saes: 5.3% vs. 2.4%; grade ≥3 teaes: 5.9% vs. 2.2%). 
 these differences were lower in the placebo group and in the combined phase 3 population. however, 
 considering the combined phase 3 studies and after adjusting for treatment duration, a similar trend of 
 a higher incidence of cardiac disorders in patients with previous history of hypertension was observed 
 in both treatment arms (enzalutamide and placebo). 
 additionally, the applicant has provided an analysis of other risk factors and the presence of selected 
 cardiovascular events (defined as myocardial infarction and other ischemic heart disease) and overall 
 a similar pattern was observed. it should be noted that the incidence of cardiovascular aes was higher 
 in those patients with a previous history of cardiac failure treated with enzalutamide. however, this 
 higher incidence would be expected. moreover, ischemic heart disease has been included in section 4.8 
 of the smpc as a common ae, and included as an important identified risk in the rmp. 
 the incidence of aes of any grade was higher in patients from north america compared to patients 
 from europe and patients from the rest of the world (91.5% vs. 85.3% vs. 87.1%, respectively) 
 whereas the frequency of saes was lower in that subgroup of patients and no great differences were 
 observed in the incidence of grade 3 or higher aes.</p><p>
 treatment discontinuations as well as dose reductions or dose interruptions were relatively low in the 
 enzalutamide group (9.4%; 10.1% and 15.4%, respectively), although higher than in the placebo 
 group (6.0%; 2.8% and 8.6%). the most common aes leading to treatment discontinuation were 
 fatigue (1.6%), mi (0.4%), cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident and nausea (0.3%, each). overall, 
 enzalutamide seems to be well tolerated. 
 the safety profile of enzalutamide in the study mdv3100-14 is in line with the known safety profile of 
 enzalutamide. compared with previous clinical trials, in which most of the patients had metastatic 
 disease, a lower incidence of aes of any grade, grade ≥ 3 aes and saes were reported in the 
 enzalutamide group in study mdv3100-14. however, regarding study drug-related aes and grade ≥ 3 
 aes incidence, no differences were observed.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 with an event rate of 23.5% and 48.7% for enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically 
 significant improvement in mfs was observed for enzalutamide compared to placebo (hr: 0.292; 95% 
 ci: 0.241, 0.352). the median mfs (95% ci) was 36.6 months (95% ci: 33.1, nr) in the 
 enzalutamide group and 14.7 months (95% ci: 14.2, 15.0) in the placebo group (δ 21.9 months). a 
 reduction in both bone metastases and soft tissue metastases was observed among patients treated 
 with enzalutamide compared to placebo. these results are supported by several sensitivity analyses as 
 well as by subgroups analyses. 
 overall, key secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. treatment with 
 enzalutamide delayed time to psa progression (hr:0.066; 95% ci: 0.054, 0.081) and time to first use

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>results in terms of os failed to show any statistically significant result and data are still rather immature so as to firmly conclude about a survival benefit. however, the positive trend observed in 
 this latter variable seems to rule out a detrimental effect. the rest of the variables provide additional 
 evidence of clinical benefit (need for first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free 
 disease-specific survival, chemotherapy-free survival) even though the immaturity of some of these 
 data preclude to draw firm conclusions. all in all, there is no doubt that from a patient perspective, the 
 fact of delaying the onset of metastases represents a value in itself, which may postpone the expected 
 symptomatology associated to the metastatic setting. the latter is also deemed valuable in the frame 
 of a non-curable disease where the increase in the time to progression should be weighed against the 
 toxicity of the treatment. however, the optimal use of enzalutamide in the course of castration-
 resistant prostate cancer remains unknown.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 despite that a clear statistically significant reduction in terms of mfs was demonstrated in the pivotal trial, there was no unequivocal impact on overall quality of life, as indicated by patient reported 
 outcomes. therefore, clinical benefit in this regard must be assumed from the nature of the primary 
 endpoint (delaying the onset of symptoms and likely deterioration of quality of life as well as the need 
 for more aggressive treatments in the metastatic setting), in the absence of more mature os data or 
 alternatively in terms of relief of disease symptomatology (time to pain progression) or delaying the 
 time to chemotherapy. 
 overall, in the absence of detrimental toxicity or marked decrease in quality of life due to treatment 
 before development of metastases, delaying metastatic disease by a considerable amount is a valid 
 objective of therapy and that this endpoint is indicative of clinical benefit per se. 
 the safety profile of enzalutamide in the treatment of non-metastatic crpc patients who had rapidly 
 rising psa, was in line with the already known safety profile, with no major differences compared to 
 previous clinical trials in terms of the incidence and severity of aes. overall, enzalutamide was well 
 tolerated.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>to date, no therapy is currently approved for progression from nonmetastatic to metastatic crpc. the current clinical guidelines include watchful waiting as one of the strategies in this setting, reflecting the 
 absence of any treatments having been proven valuable. 
 results from prosper trial are considered to demonstrate a clinically and statistically significant 
 advantage in terms of mfs for patients with high-risk non-metastatic crpc, without indications of a 
 detrimental effect on overall survival, whereas the safety profile of enzalutamide was acceptable. the 
 benefit-risk balance was concluded to be positive. the finally approved indication was restricted to 
 more accurately reflect the high-risk m0 crpc population.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.  
 additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance</header><p>there is uncertainty related to how the introduction of enzalutamide prior to development of metastasis could influence in later lines (cross-resistance). although pfs2 data could shed some light 
 in this issue, this was not included as endpoint in the pivotal trial. it remains unknown whether the 
 best use of enzalutamide is in the present line of therapy or rather in later lines, where an os benefit 
 has been shown. however, determining the optimal sequencing of available agents throughout the 
 course of the disease is a complex task that falls outside the scope of this marketing authorisation. 
 such studies are encouraged.</p></section><section><header n="3.8">3.8.  
 conclusions</header><p>the benefit/risk for enzalutamide in the treatment of high-risk non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer is positive. 
 the chmp considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
 a post-authorisation efficacy study (paes) in order to investigate the long-term effects of enzalutamide 
 on overall survival and relevant secondary endpoints in adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
 castration-resistant prostate cancer. the mah should submit the results of the mdv3100-14
