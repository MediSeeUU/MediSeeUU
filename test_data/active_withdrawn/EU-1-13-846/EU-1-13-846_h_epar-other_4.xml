 with regards to “rash”, due to the number of icsrs detected on the cumulative review provided by the 
 mah, with a plausible temporal relationship, positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge and the increase 
 of pts containing “rash” presented in this psusa, the mah is requested to include rash as an adverse 
 reaction in the product information . 
 in addition, due to plausible temporal relationship between the drug exposure and onset of the events 
 of “tongue oedema”, “lip oedema” and “pharyngeal oedema”, the mah is requested the three as 
 adverse reactions in the product information. 
 due to the cumulative number of icsrs of “nausea” detected (384) and that in the cumulative search 
 performed by the mah approximately 25 cases had a plausible temporal association between the event 
 of nausea and enzalutamide, the mah is requested to include nausea as an adverse reaction in the 
 product information. 
 and finally, due to the number of cases of “vomiting” with positive dechallenge and rechallenge in 
 some of them and the compatible timelines, the mah is requested to include vomiting as an adverse 
 reaction in the product information.</p><p>
 therefore, in view of available data regarding enzalutamide, the prac considered that changes to the 
 product information were warranted. 
 the chmp agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the prac.</p></section><section><header>grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation</header><p>on the basis of the scientific conclusions for enzalutamide the chmp is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing enzalutamide is favourable subject to the 
 proposed changes to the product information. 
 the chmp recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.</p><p>ema/212233/2015</p><p>page 2/2</p></section></body></xml>
