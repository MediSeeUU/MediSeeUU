 worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and sixth in cancer mortality in men (jemal, 2011).</p><p>in prostate cancer, hormonal therapies include surgical or medical castration therapy. 
 tumours that progress despite castrate levels of testosterone in the blood are considered castration-
 resistant.</p><p>despite the early sensitivity of these tumours to hormonal strategies, castration-resistant 
 progression generally represents a transition to the lethal state of the illness, and most patients 
 ultimately succumb to this disease.</p><p>the median survival of patients with castration-resistant disease is 
 approximately 1–2 years (lassi, 2010, petrylak, 2004). 
 treatment 
 results of clinical investigations and studies on the molecular profiles of these progressing prostate 
 tumours show that the androgen receptor remains functional and that the tumours should respond to 
 strategies directed at the androgen receptor signalling axis.</p><p>over-expression of the androgen receptor 
 has been documented in upwards of 50% of castration-resistant prostate cancer specimens and is 
 believed to contribute to tumour progression (pienta, 2006, chen, 2004).</p><p>currently approved anti-
 androgens, including bicalutamide and flutamide, have the potential to agonize or stimulate androgen 
 receptor signalling in the setting of androgen receptor over-expression, thereby exacerbating or 
 accelerating castration-resistant tumour growth (kelly, 1993, small, 1995).</p><p>the resulting decline in 
 serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (psa) seen in some patients upon discontinuation of these 
 agents is consistent with the agonist effects (“anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome”;). 
 in clinical practice, treatment of advanced prostate cancer is limited by the development of resistance 
 to currently available anti-androgen therapies.</p><p>most patients receive 2 or more hormonal 
 manipulations and are then offered chemotherapy as their disease continues to progress (chen, 2004).</p><p>
 three agents have demonstrated a survival advantage and are approved for the treatment of 
 castration-resistant prostate cancer:</p><p>docetaxel with prednisone as front-line chemotherapy; 
 cabazitaxel with prednisone following docetaxel; and abiraterone acetate with prednisone or 
 prednisolone (a hormonal therapy that blocks androgen synthesis). 
 the randomized study in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer comparing docetaxel 
 administered every 3 weeks to docetaxel weekly and to mitoxantrone demonstrated a 2.4 months 
 survival benefit for docetaxel every 3 weeks (tannock, 2004).</p><p>once patients progress on docetaxel, 
 cabazitaxel is approved as second-line chemotherapy with a 2.4 month survival advantage over 
 mitoxantrone plus prednisone (de bono, 2010).</p><p>this intravenous chemotherapy is complicated by 
 febrile neutropenia, neutropenic deaths, and serious gastrointestinal side effects including diarrhoea.</p><p>
 recently, abiraterone acetate, an oral inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, has been approved for 
 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously received docetaxel 
 after demonstrating a 3.9-month survival advantage over placebo (de bono, 2011).</p><p>treatment with 
 abiraterone acetate requires the co-administration of prednisone and is complicated by the side effects 
 of mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension, hypokalaemia, and fluid overload), hepatotoxicity, and 
 adrenal insufficiency.</p><p>abiraterone is also indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
 of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly 
 symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically 
 indicated.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>enzalutamide (mdv3100) is an oral androgen receptor signalling inhibitor designed to block multiple steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway and to be devoid of agonist activity in castration-
 resistant prostate cancer.</p><p>in initial pharmacology experiments, mdv3100 competitively inhibited 
 androgen-induced receptor activation (binding of androgens to androgen receptor in the cytosol), 
 inhibited nuclear translocation of activated androgen receptors, and inhibited the association of the 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/383457/2013</p><p>
 page 12/86</p><p>
 activated androgen receptor with chromatin, even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens.</p><p>the consequences of androgen receptor 
 signalling inhibition by mdv3100 include reduced expression of androgen receptor dependent genes, 
 decreased growth of prostate cancer cells, induction of cancer cell death, and tumour regression.</p><p> 
 the applicant claimed the approval for the following indication: 
 xtandi is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer</p><p>
 who have received docetaxel therapy.</p><p>the final indication following chmp review of this application is: 
 xtandi is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
 whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>this application has been submitted in accordance with the article 8(3) of directive 2001/83/ec, concerning a new active substance in the centralised procedure containing administrative, quality, non-
 clinical and clinical data. 
 a request for accelerated assessment has been rejected by the chmp on 21 june 2012 as the chmp 
 considered the applicant’s claims related to the unmet medical need were not substantiated by 
 submitted data.</p><p>
 scientific advice on the design of the crpc2 study was not requested from the chmp.</p><p>however, 
 scientific advice on other aspects of the nonclinical, pharmacology, and clinical program was requested 
 from the chmp on 24 june 2010 (ema/chmp/sawp/372658/2010) with follow-up advice received on 
 20 january 2011 (ema/chmp/sawp/18792/2011).</p><p>the chmp concurred that the elements of a 
 comprehensive electrocardiogram (ecg) evaluation, including qt/qtc assessments performed by a 
 central laboratory, embedded into the crpc2 study would be acceptable to support the clinical 
 development program in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
 although the initial chmp scientific advice stated that the metabolism of mdv3100 could be conducted 
 with cold material, a standard 14c metabolism study (9785-cl-0001) was conducted in healthy 
 subjects to provide definitive information on the metabolic fate of mdv3100.</p><p>the final approach for 
 examining metabolism was agreed upon by the chmp at the follow-up scientific advice.</p><p>the results of 
 the 14c-metabolism study were consistent with the advice from the chmp, including nearly 90% 
 recovery of total radioactivity over the 77-day collection period (mean 84.6%, range:</p><p>75.4%–92.0%, 
 n = 6).</p><p>the chmp also noted that data derived from the 14c-study, as well as in vitro data supporting 
 expected bioavailability (i.e., caco-2 permeability), could be used instead of an absolute bioavailability 
 study assuming that high bioavailability was predicted. 
 the chmp agreed that the completed parallel design food-effects study (mdv3100-05) could be used 
 to support labelling.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.

 11. the chemical name is 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-
 thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro-
 n-methylbenzamide, also known as 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro-
 n-methylbenzamide, 3-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-[3-fluoro-4-(methylcarbamoyl)phenyl]-5,5-
 dimethyl-2-thioxoimidazolin-4-one, and benzamide, 4-[3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-

 n-methyl and has the following structure:</p><p>
 the structure of enzalutamide was unambiguously confirmed by 
 1h and 13c nmr, uv spectroscopy, ft-ir spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis.</p><p>
 enzalutamide is achiral, therefore no stereoisomerism is observed. a single polymorphic form has been 
 observed which is consistently produced by the manufacturing process. the pure drug substance thus 
 produced melts at 201 
 oc. four other solvates have been observed but are not produced from the manufacturing process.</p></section><section><header>manufacture</header><p>enzalutamide is synthesized in four main steps from three commercially available, well defined starting materials. detailed information about the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, 
 reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates along with process development and 
 validation has been provided. step 1 is performed by a single manufacturer. step 2 is carried out by a 
 different single manufacturer. steps 3 and 4 are performed by a further single manufacturer. 
 the manufacturing process is adequately described. appropriate specifications have been adopted for 
 the starting materials, taking into account their route of synthesis, as well as for intermediates, 
 solvents and reagents. all relevant impurities, including degradation products and residual solvents 
 have been appropriately characterised and are controlled at safe limits. several critical process 
 parameters (cpps) were identified which are well-controlled in the process by the choice of adequate 
 set-points and operation within achievable operating ranges. therefore, the manufacturer has good 
 control over the manufacturing process and the described in-process controls are considered adequate 
 to ensure the required quality of intermediates and active substance. 
 the active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags with twist ties and then stored in steel 
 drums.</p></section><section><header>specification</header><p>the active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (ir, hplc), assay (hplc) impurities (hplc), genotoxic impurities (gc), residual solvents (gc), heavy metals (usp method ii), 
 and residue on ignition (ph. eur.). rationale for the absence of water content specification was 
 considered justified. the specifications and test proposed are compliant with the relevant ich 
 guidelines and general requirements of ph. eur., except for the heavy metals test for which usp

 method is used since this was considered more sensitive. the specifications are adequate to control the quality of the active substance. the impurity profile of the active substance has been thoroughly 
 evaluated. the applicant has provided information about the origin of impurities and levels observed in 
 the drug substance. the impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view 
 of safety. 
 batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. the 
 results comply with the proposed specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the active 
 substance manufacture.</p></section><section><header>stability</header><p>one commercial scale batch of the active substance packed in the intended commercial package from the proposed manufacturer was put on stability testing as per ich conditions, under long term 
 conditions (25 °c / 60% rh) for up to 24 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 °c / 75% rh) 
 for up to 6 months. two further commercial scale batches of the active substance from a different 
 manufacturer packed in double polyethylene bags but in a hdpe drum were also put on stability testing 
 as per ich conditions:</p><p>under long term conditions (25 °c / 60% rh) for up to 18 months, and under 
 accelerated conditions (40 °c / 75% rh) for up to 6 months. stability was also tested under stressed 
 conditions. in the solid state, the active substance was stored in an open dish, heated, and exposed to 
 light. stability was also tested under stressed conditions in solution: acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, 
 oxidation and light. the following parameters were tested: appearance, assay (hplc), impurities 
 (hplc), water content (kf) and form (xrpd). the active substance was stable to ich long term 
 storage conditions, heat, humidity, and light, and in solution, to acid. degradation was observed in 
 solution on exposure to peroxide, base, and light. the results demonstrate that the analytical methods 
 are stability indicating. in conclusion, no special storage conditions are required and the results justify 
 the proposed re-test conditions in the proposed container.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.3">2.2.3.  
 finished medicinal product 
 pharmaceutical development</header><p>the objectives of formulation development were to develop an immediate-release oral dose of enzalutamide. the active substance is a crystalline solid, routinely manufactured as a single 
 polymorphic form. it is practically insoluble in aqueous media between ph 1-11 but highly permeable 
 (bcs class ii) and thus, dissolution of the active substance is rate-limiting for bioavailability. early 
 animal studies demonstrated that bioavailability was greater when enzalutamide was dosed as a 
 solution rather than as a suspension or solid formulation. therefore, the primary goal of the 
 pharmaceutical development program was to formulate the active substance in the liquid state, 
 encased within a capsule. as a result, and despite the low aqueous solubility, particle size and 
 morphology were not considered as critical quality attributes of the active substance. 
 caprylocaproyl macroglycerides (ccmg) was identified as the solvent in which the active substance has 
 the greatest solubility, allowing a reasonably sized capsule to be manufactured containing the intended 
 40 mg strength of enzalutamide. studies to address the precipitation risk at this concentration were 
 carried out and indicated the long-term solution stability of this formulation. anti-oxidants are included 
 to prevent oxidative degradation of the active substance on storage. their use has been justified as the 
 oxidative degradants are not controllable by other means. a hard shell capsule was used for phase i 
 clinical studies, but the applicant switched to a more robust soft shell capsule for later clinical studies 
 and the commercial product.

 all of the chosen excipients are well-known and widely used in the production of soft capsules and liquid formulations. the excipients include: ccmg (solvent); water; butylated hydroxytoluene (bht) 
 and butylated hydroxyanisole (bha, both antioxidants); gelatin (shell material); sorbitol sorbitan 
 solution and glycerol (plasticizer); titanium dioxide (colorant and opacifier); black printing ink. ccmg, 
 bha, bht, gelatin and titanium dioxide are controlled in accordance with ph. eur. monographs. the 
 plasticizer agents met the following standards respectively, sorbitol sorbitan solution (nf) and glycerol 
 (ph. eur.). the black printing ink is a mixture of compendial components including iron oxide black (ec 
 directive) and polyvinyl acetate phthalate (nf) which also meet in-house specifications. the active 
 substance was demonstrated to be compatible with the excipients. 
 the formulation used during phase ii and iii clinical studies is slightly different from that planned for 
 commercial use. there is a small reduction in anti-oxidant level and compensatory increase in ccmg, 
 but these are not considered likely to affect the bioavailability. a single impurity, not present in the 
 active substance, was identified as forming by oxidation during secondary manufacture and on storage. 
 its formation is controlled by the antioxidants throughout shelf-life and thus oxidative stability of the 
 commercial formulation has been demonstrated. 
 the primary packaging proposed is pvc/pctfe/alu blisters, with four capsules per blister. the material 
 complies with ph. eur. requirements and is adequate to support the stability and use of the product.</p></section><section><header>adventitious agents</header><p>bovine derived gelatin is used in the capsule shell. a valid tse cep from the suppliers of the gelatin used in the manufacture is provided.</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product</header><p>the manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: (i) enzalutamide, bha, bht, and ccmg are mixed to form the fill solution; (ii) a blend of gelatin, water, plasticizers and colorant are mixed to form the 
 gel mass; (iii) the gel mass is used to form the capsule and the fill solution is added (iv) the capsule is 
 sealed, washed and dried. a detailed description and flow diagram of the manufacturing process has 
 been provided. adequate process controls are in place for each of these steps to ensure the quality of 
 the finished product. the process is considered standard for the production of soft liquid-filled gel 
 capsules. therefore, formal validation of the process in the production facilities has not yet been 
 completed but will be carried out prior to release of xtandi soft gel capsules to the market. a process 
 validation scheme has been provided and the applicant has committed to validating the process before 
 commercialisation. 
 a risk assessment was carried out to identify potential critical steps in the manufacturing process and 
 these were investigated experimentally. a single critical step was identified which affects assay, 
 content uniformity, and appearance. operating ranges for the key process parameters</p><p>were defined to 
 ensure quality of the xtandi capsules.</p></section><section><header>product specification</header><p>the finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for appearance (visual description), identification (hplc and uv), assay (hplc), degradants (hplc), uniformity of dosage unit 
 (hplc), anti-oxidants (hplc), dissolution (ph. eur.), and microbiological limits (ph. eur.). no tests for 
 water content or active substance impurities are included and this has been justified by the applicant. 
 batch analysis results from three pilot scale (30% of commercial scale) batches confirm consistency 
 and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control.

 proposed commercial packaging. samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradants, anti-oxidant

 the applicant commits to further testing at up to 36 months under long-term conditions (25 ºc / 60%

 placed on stability. 
 in addition, stability under stressed conditions was investigated.one pilot batch was exposed to both 
 uv and visible light as defined in the ich guideline q1b on photostability testing of new drug 
 substances and products. the drug product was tested for appearance, assay, degradants, and rupture 
 in water. no significant changes in xtandi soft gel capsule quality attributes were observed and thus, 
 the product is not sensitive to light. 
 one development batch was exposed to four freeze-thaw cycles (-25 – 20 
 oc) over 4 weeks. no significant changes in xtandi soft gel capsule quality attributes were observed, and in particular, no 
 precipitation of active substance was noted, and thus, the product is stable to low temperature 
 conditions. 
 one pilot batch was stored under long-term conditions (25 ºc / 60% rh) and under intermediate 
 conditions (30 ºc / 65% rh) for up to 8 weeks in an open dish. the drug product was tested for 
 appearance, assay, degradants, rupture in water, and water content. an increase in water content was 
 observed but this did not result in significant changes to xtandi soft gel capsule quality attributes.

 with inhibition concentration 50% (ic
 50) values of 0.021 µm (0.0098 µg/ml) and 0.062 µm (0.029 µg/ml), respectively.</p><p> 
 in competition binding studies performed with the synthetic ar agonist 
 3h-r-1881 (methyltrienolone), mdv3100 inhibited the agonist in a concentration-dependent manner. the inhibition constant was 
 largely unaffected by the concentration of 
 3h-r-1881 used in the assay, indicating competitive inhibition. 
 in an in vitro study using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, binding of mdv3100 to ar 
 prevented the conformational change necessary for ar co-activator protein association, whereas 
 binding of dihydrotestosterone (dht) or bicalutamide induced this conformational change required for 
 optimum ar signalling.</p><p>
 inhibition of androgen receptor nuclear translocation 
 inhibition of ar signalling was evaluated using cell-based activity assays specific for nuclear 
 translocation and association with nuclear co-activator protein. androgen receptor nuclear 
 translocation was evaluated by a qualitative method using an ar-fluorescent fusion protein system as 
 well as a quantitative method using a beta-galactosidase (β-gal) enzyme fragment complementation

 that uses a vp16-ar fusion protein with an ar-dependent luciferase transcription reporter system.</p><p>
 while androgens are not required to induce nuclear localization of the vp16-ar fusion protein, they are 
 required to activate the ar-dependent gene expression reporter system.</p><p>in this assay system, 
 mdv3100 inhibited r-1881-induced activation of the luciferase reporter, consistent with inhibition of 
 nuclear ar signalling, independent of the nuclear translocation step.

 the consequence of ar signalling inhibition by mdv3100 in prostate cancer cells was demonstrated in 
 cell-based assays of ar-dependent transcription, cell growth, and cell death.</p><p>mdv3100 consistently 
 inhibited ar-mediated gene expression, reduced cell growth, and increased cell death by apoptosis in 
 castration-resistant cell lines (lncap/ar, vcap, and w741c-lncap).</p><p>
 in a mouse xenograft model implanted with lncap/ar cells mdv3100 inhibited tumour cell growth and 
 induced tumour regression. 
 lack of androgen receptor agonist activity 
 mdv3100 was tested in a series of tissue culture assays as described above that included several 
 distinct steps in ar signalling (nuclear translocation, ar co-activator protein association, and ar 
 association with chromatin), as well as the consequence of ar signalling.</p><p>in all of these assays, 
 mdv3100 lacked agonist activity while the agonist activity of the anti-androgens such as bicalutamide 
 was apparent.</p><p>mdv3100 inhibited tumour cell growth and induced tumour regression in a 
 dose-dependent fashion in an in vivo mouse lncap/ar xenograft model.</p><p>in this model, bicalutamide

 the key primary pharmacodynamics of mdv3100:</p><p>ar binding in vitro and inhibition of ar nuclear

 with the human progesterone receptor (ic50 = 16.1 μm for mdv3100, 6.2 μm for m2) and the rat 
 gaba-gated chloride channel (ic50 = 2.6 μm for mdv3100, 7.1 μm for m2). a cell-based activity assay 
 for the gaba-gated chloride channel (α1β3 gaba-a receptor subtype) demonstrated that both parent 
 and metabolite m2 were functional inhibitors of this channel. on the other hand, major metabolite m1 
 only bound weakly to the gaba-gated chloride channel, and no interactions of m1 were detected in

 clearance is low. with daily oral administration, the mean accumulation index is approximately 1 to 3 
 in rats, 1 to 4 in dogs and 8.3 in humans, reflecting the long t ½ relative to the dosing interval. a 
 gender difference in pk is apparent in rats, with a 2-fold higher exposure in females, but not in mice, 
 dogs or monkeys. 
 in the absorption studies it was shown that mdv3100 as a caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides (ccmg) 
 solution is well absorbed after oral administration in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. at low doses, oral 
 bioavailability in rats and dogs is greater than 70% and decreases with increasing size. on the other 
 hand, in the pk studies in dogs performed to support formulation development it was shown that oral 
 bioavailability is higher when dosed as a ccmg solution than when dosed as a suspension in ccmg or 
 other particulate formulation. in addition, mdv3100 as a ccmg solution has high oral bioavailability, 
 which is not increased by combining ccmg with other solvents or surfactants. the ccmg formulation

 brain-to-plasma concentration ratios, mdv3100 and m2 appear to readily partition into brain, while m1 appears to have low penetration into brain. 
 mdv3100, m1 and m2 showed a high binding to plasma protein in vitro (&gt;90% for all species) over a 
 wide range of concentrations. after a single oral dose of 14c-mdv3100 in rats and dogs, the mean 
 cb/cp ratios generally range from 0.456 to 0.659, indicating that drug-derived radioactivity is 
 preferentially retained in the plasma component of blood.</p></section><section><header>metabolism</header><p>in the metabolism studies performed with 14c-mdv3100, it was shown that mdv3100 is extensively metabolised in rats, dogs and humans via the same phase i pathways, mainly demethylation, oxidation 
 and hydrolysis reactions. phase ii products were observed in animals only in bile, these metabolites

 at higher levels in the intended clinical lot of mdv3100 than in the lot used in the previous 4-week rat 
 toxicity study (pro3100nc31). the toxicological adverse effects observed in this study were similar to 
 those detected in the previous 4-week study in rats (pro3100nc17). there were no additional 
 toxicological findings attributable to the impurity profile based on comparisons to the results of other 
 rat toxicity studies. 
 process-related impurities of mdv3100 were evaluated for structural alerts using the derek software. 
 alerts for genotoxicity included p1 and p2 precursors of mdv3136 (a 5-amino-2-cyanobenzotrofluoride 
 precursor to mdv3100). further evaluation consisting of a mini-ames test, where only 2 strains of 
 salmonella typhimurium were used. in this study, both compounds were cytotoxic and one caused a small increase in revertants in the strain t100 at the highest concentration tested. the applicant 
 concluded that these potentially genotoxic precursor should be controlled by manufacturing processes 
 to a threshold of toxicological concern of 5.0 μg/day or 30 ppm. although the testing (mini-ames test) 
 did not comply with the established guidelines and recommendations, considering the indication of 
 xtandi and that these impurities are appropriately controlled in the manufacturing process, no further 
 studies are required. 
 ccmg toxicity 
 ccmg (caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides [nf] or caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides [ph. eur.]) is a 
 non-ionic amphiphilic excipient for pharmaceutical preparations. it is used as a solubilizing agent for 
 poorly soluble drugs in oral liquid and capsule formulations. ccmg showed low toxicity in rats with an

 discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>the primary pharmacodynamics studies have demonstrated the proof of concept and mode of action of mdv3100 and the active major metabolite m2. mdv3100 did not show androgen receptor agonist 
 activity.</p><p>
 the safety pharmacology studies concerning the central nervous system showed that mdv3100 is 
 associated with dose-dependent convulsions in mice. these convulsions occurred at plasma 
 concentrations that are higher than those expected in humans at the proposed clinical dose of 160 
 mg/day.</p><p>
 both mdv3100 and metabolite m2 are antagonists of the gaba-gated chloride channel. this interaction 
 may be the mechanism for the convulsions, as some compounds that inhibit the chloride channel 
 induce seizures. however, the α1β3 gabaa receptor subtype is not abundant in human brain; hence 
 the quantitative extrapolation from these 
 in vitro data is limited. convulsions were also observed in several general toxicology studies at high doses in rats and dogs. 
 the respiratory and cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies performed in rats and dogs, 
 respectively, showed no other adverse effects. in the in vitro herg assay mdv3100 and the metabolite 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/383457/2013</p><p>
 page 29/86</p><p>
 m2 were able to inhibit the herg current, although in the in vivo studies in rats and dogs no effects on the ecg were detected. in patients, some ecg alterations were observed. 
 in the pharmacokinetic studies it was shown that mdv3100 is eliminated slowly from plasma with a 
 long t ½ across species. with daily oral administration, the mean accumulation index is approximately 
 1 to 3 in rats, 1 to 4 in dogs and 8.3 in humans, reflecting the long t ½ relative to the dosing interval. 
 a gender difference in pk is apparent in rats, with a 2-fold higher exposure in females, but not in mice, 
 dogs or monkeys. 
 considering the clinical data on pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or 
 substances, no non-clinical drug interactions studies are required. 
 in the absorption studies it was shown that mdv3100 as a ccmg solution is well absorbed after oral 
 administration in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. in the pk studies in dogs it was shown that oral 
 bioavailability is higher when dosed as a ccmg solution than when dosed as a suspension in ccmg or 
 other particulate formulation. tissue distribution data in rats show rapid and extensive distribution to 
 all tissues. the tissues with the higher concentrations are fat, stomach and liver. mdv3100 and the 
 metabolites m1 and m2 were detected in the brain of rats, indicating that they can cross the blood-
 brain barrier in rats. mdv3100, m1 and m2 showed a high binding to plasma protein in vitro (&gt;90% for 
 all species) over a wide range of concentrations. in the metabolism studies performed with 14c-
 mdv3100, it was shown that mdv3100 is extensively metabolized in rats, dogs and humans via the 
 same phase i pathways, mainly demethylation, oxidation and hydrolysis reactions. orally administered 
 mdv3100 is mainly eliminated as metabolites in the urine and faeces in rats and dogs. in rat, urine 
 and faeces have a similar importance, whereas in dogs and humans urinary is the major route of 
 excretion. 
 the general toxicology studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs. mortality was observed in most 
 studies in rats and dogs. in some cases this was attributed to gavage error or accidental aspiration of 
 the ccmg formulation. nonetheless, some of the deaths occurred during the toxicity studies could not 
 be explained by the ccmg aspiration and several of the premature deaths seem to be related to the 
 treatment with mdv3100.</p><p>
 the macroscopic and microscopic findings observed in prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testes and 
 epididymides in rats and dogs are consistent with the primary pharmacological properties of mdv3100 
 and have been previously observed with non-steroidal anti-androgen compounds such as bicalutamide. 
 qualitatively similar effects in male reproductive organs have been described for the androgen 
 biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone
 1. these findings were fully or partially reversed at the end of the recovery period. 
 there were no apparent gender differences in systemic exposures in dogs after repeat administration. 
 in rats, systemic exposure to mdv3100 was consistently higher in females than in males at all dosage 
 levels. with daily oral administration, the mean accumulation index was approximately 1 to 3 in rats 
 and 1 to 4 in dogs. the magnitude of accumulation did not appear to increase with the dose. systemic 
 exposure to mdv3100 in repeat dose toxicity studies was similar (dogs) or up to 3-fold (rats) that 
 observed in patients. the two major human metabolites m1 and m2 were measured in some toxicity 
 studies in rat and dog. dedicated toxicity studies for m2 have not been performed, and according to 
 the guideline emea/chmp/ich/646107/2008 s9 a separate toxicological evaluation of metabolites is 
 generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer. 
 although rat and dog exposures to m2 in the toxicity studies were lower than patient exposures to m2, 
 the applicant does not consider this a significant issue relevant to the use of mdv3100 in advanced 
 1 zytiga: epar public assessment report (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_gb/document_library/epar_-_public_assessment_report/human/002321/wc500112860.pdf)

 page 30/86</p><p> cancer. based on the similarity of the molecular structures of mdv3100 and m2, and also the comparability of the potency against all primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints, the 
 toxicity profile is likely to be similar for the 2 molecules. therefore, low exposure to m2 in the toxicity 
 studies is unlikely to have a major impact on the overall benefit-risk assessment for patients with 
 advanced cancer.</p><p>
 the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were negative. as suggested by the scientific advice by 
 the ema (ema/chmp/sawp/372658/2010) on 24
 th june 2010, the applicant has performed an in silico qsar analysis for the human metabolites. no structural alert was found in this study; considering this 
 study and the guideline emea/chmp/ich/646107/2008 s9, no further genotoxicity testing is 
 necessary. 
 no carcinogenicity studies were performed, according to the guideline emea/chmp/ich/646107/2008 
 s9, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat 
 patients with advanced cancer.</p><p>
 considering the indication and the target patient population, no reproductive and development toxicity 
 studies would be required. the effects of mdv3100 on the reproductive system were evaluated during 
 the general toxicology studies, with findings and organ weight changes in the prostate gland, seminal 
 vesicles, testes and epididymides. in a study conducted to assess the effects of the treatment on 
 reproductive tissues in male dogs, transient effects on male reproductive organs were observed. 
 changes in the reproductive organs in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity 
 of enzalutamide and reversed or partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. in the non-glp 
 embryo-foetal development study in mice submitted, mdv3100 induced premature deliveries in dams, 
 embryo-foetal deaths and abnormalities. 
 the need for nonclinical dependence studies was assessed based on the in vitro binding data, in vivo 
 data on the penetration and accumulation in the cns, findings in the in vivo safety pharmacology 
 studies, and the available clinical data. the nonclinical data suggest that mdv3100 is unlikely to have 
 abuse liability. 
 the applicant presented a bridging study to assess the toxic potential of impurities a, c, g, that were 
 observed at higher levels in the intended clinical lot of mdv3100 than in the lot used in the previous 4-
 week rat toxicity study (pro3100nc31). the impurities a, c and g have been qualified within this 
 study. 
 considering the result of the general toxicology studies performed via oral administration, no further 
 local tolerance studies are necessary. 
 the doses of ccmg in the rat and dog toxicity studies were approximately 6.2- and 4.9-fold higher, 
 respectively, than the human dose of ccmg. therefore, considering that the margins of safety with the 
 nonclinical studies are sufficient and the toxicity data for ccmg provided by the applicant, no further 
 studies are required. 
 according to applicable guideline on the era of medicinal products (emea/chmp/swp/4447/00), 
 certain substances, such as highly lipophilic compounds and potential endocrine disruptors, may need 
 to be addressed irrespective of the quantity released into the environment. the active ingredient 
 enzalutamide is a hormone and a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several 
 steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. a complete phase ii environmental fate and effect 
 analysis is therefore recommended.</p><p>
 as a result of the above considerations, further data is needed to conclude definitively on the potential 
 risk of enzalutamide to the environment. it is recommended that the applicant conducts the fish early 
 life cycle test (oecd 210) and the fish sexual development test (oecd 234). the expected starting

 the final indication following chmp review of this application is: 
 xtandi is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
 whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.2">2.4.2.  
 pharmacokinetics</header><p>the single dose clinical pharmacology program was performed in healthy male volunteers, whereas the multiple dose studies were done in prostate cancer patients. one of the two main plasma metabolites, 
 m2, has an activity similar to that of the parent compound and has a higher plasma auc and lower 
 protein binding than mdv3100 itself, and is thus expected to contribute substantially to drug effect.</p></section><section><header>absorption</header><p>maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of enzalutamide in patients are observed 1 to 2 hours after administration.</p><p>no oral bioavailability study has been performed.</p><p>
 based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated to be at least 
 84.2%.</p><p>enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters p-gp or bcrp. at steady state, the 
 mean c
 max values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 μg/ml (23% coefficient of variation (cv)) and 12.7 μg/ml (30 %cv), respectively. 
 the in vitro permeability of mdv3100 is high, and in the mass balance study, 71% of the dose was 
 recovered in urine and 13% of the dose as metabolites in faeces, indicating a high extent of 
 absorption. together with low aqueous solubility, mdv3100 can be considered a bcs class ii 
 substance.</p><p>
 the solubility of mdv3100 is increased with ccmg (an emulsifier/surfactant). with the proposed 
 dosing, almost 4 g ccmg will be administered on one occasion. in addition to increasing the solubility 
 of poorly dissolved substances, ccmg may also be a pgp inhibitor according to literature.</p><p>
 a high-fat meal resulted in no effect on total exposure of mdv3100, but decreased c
 max around 30% and delayed absorption (t
 max 2 hours instead of 1 hour in the fasting state).</p></section><section><header>distribution</header><p>the mean apparent volume of distribution (v/f) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 110 l (29% cv). in vitro data show high protein binding of both mdv3100 (97-98%) and major 
 plasma metabolites (m1 98%, m2 95-97%). albumin seems to be the most important binding protein. 
 data suggests no concentration-dependence in binding. the impact of mild-to-moderate renal 
 impairment on the extent of protein binding was considered low. the impact of severe renal 
 impairment on the extent of protein binding has not been explored. the protein binding of m2 was

 ema/chmp/383457/2013</p><p>
 page 34/86</p><p>
 95% in the in vitro protein binding study and 97% in the hepatic impairment study. the in vitro protein binding indicates a substantially higher unbound fraction of m2 (3-5%) than of mdv3100 (2-3%). ex 
 vivo data indicate a slightly higher unbound fraction for m2 (2.6-3.6%; protein binding 96-97%) than 
 for mdv3100 (1.5-2.4%, protein binding 98%), but not as large difference as indicated in the in vitro 
 data.</p></section><section><header>elimination</header><p>in the mass-balance study after a single dose of mdv3100, in parallel to parent drug (29% of total radioactivity auc) two major plasma metabolites were identified, m1 (10% of total auc) and m2 (49% 
 of total auc), both of which had a slower elimination than parent compound. as mdv3100 and the two 
 metabolites m1 and m2 together constituted almost 90% of total radioactivity auc, and no unidentified 
 metabolites were found, it seems unlikely that there would be other quantitatively or 
 pharmacologically/toxicologically important plasma metabolites.</p><p>
 after a single dose in the mass balance study, m2 has a 70% higher auc than parent, and probably 
 contributes substantially to the clinical activity of mdv3100. in addition, m2 has a higher (up to 
 double) free fraction. despite the somewhat higher free fraction of m2, the unbound levels of parent 
 compound and m2 can be considered to be of similar magnitude in the average patient at steady state. 
 in light of the similar potency in vitro pharmacology screens and the proposed high permeability of 
 both entities, the applicant suggest that parent compound and m2 play similar roles in contributing to 
 the overall safety and efficacy profiles of xtandi in patients. 
 in vitro studies in human liver microsomes and recombinant cyp isoforms indicate that cyp3a4/5 and 
 cyp2c8 were capable of catalysing the degradation of mdv3100. the main metabolite identified in 
 microsomal incubations was m6. the importance of cyp2c8, and to a lower extent cyp3a4, was 
 verified in vivo in interaction studies with the cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (the auc of the total active 
 moiety, mdv3100 plus m2, was increased by 117%, up to 5-fold increase in mdv3100 auc) and the 
 cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (40% increase in mdv3100 auc).</p><p>
 in many studies with cyp2c8 substrates, no clinically significant effects of enzyme polymorphism have 
 been detected. some studies have shown a somewhat higher enzyme activity of the cyp2c8*3 allele. 
 this is in line with the trend towards lower enzalutamide exposure observed for patients with cyp2c8 
 wt/*3 seen in the 61 patients with known cyp2c8 genotype in the enzalutamide trials. data on 
 homozygotes are lacking, but this genotype is uncommon.</p><p>
 mdv3100 is mainly hepatically eliminated, and renal excretion of unchanged drug is low (&lt;0.2% of 
 dose). mdv3100 is a low extraction drug with an oral clearance of around 0.55 l/h. mean terminal 
 half-life in patients after a single dose is 5.8 days. with daily administration, mdv3100 accumulates 
 approximately 8-fold.</p><p>
 the metabolites of mdv3100 are excreted mainly in urine, and the most abundant metabolites in urine 
 are m1 followed by m7. no relevant biliary excretion seems to occur.</p><p>
 the mean apparent clearance (cl/f) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 l/h.</p><p>
 following oral administration of 
 14c-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of 
 enzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as 
 unchanged enzalutamide).

 page 35/86</p></section><section><header>dose proportionality and time dependencies</header><p>no major deviations from dose proportionality were detected over the dose range 40 to 160 mg, neither after a single dose nor at steady state. no time dependent pharmacokinetics was detected at 
 therapeutic dose levels, whereas a slight tendency to increased auc with time was discerned at higher 
 dose levels. an 8-fold accumulation and around one month to steady state is expected from the long 
 half-life (around 6 days) of mdv3100.</p><p>
 in vitro as well as clinical interaction studies show that cyp3a4 is induced by mdv3100 and cyp3a4 is 
 suggested to contribute to the metabolism of mdv3100. thus an autoinduction would be expected. 
 due to the long half-life of mdv3100 and its metabolites, it could well be that auto induction is evident 
 also after a single dose and thus time-dependent pharmacokinetics would be difficult to detect in the 
 data available.</p></section><section><header>special populations</header><p>no formal studies have been completed to assess the effect of intrinsic factors, such as age, race, weight, height, or renal function, on mdv3100 exposure and response.</p><p>the influence of patient 
 covariates (weight, age, serum creatinine) on mdv3100 exposure were assessed with linear regression 
 and population pk analyses showing that dosing adjustments are not indicated and that these 
 covariates do not have clinically meaningful on the exposures to mdv3100.</p><p>
 renal impairment no formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed.</p><p>patients with serum creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) were excluded from clinical trials.</p><p>no clinically relevant effects of 
 renal function on mdv3100 clearance was observed in the phase iii data.</p><p>
 liver impairment the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (n = 6) or moderate (n = 8) hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b, respectively) and in 14 matched 
 control subjects with normal hepatic function.</p><p>following a single oral 160 mg dose of enzalutamide, 
 the auc and c
 max for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% and 24%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects.</p><p>for the sum of 
 unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc and c
 max in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, compared to healthy control 
 subjects.</p><p>the patients in the moderate hepatic impairment group however had only modest 
 impairment in parameters indicative of metabolic function (albumin, prothrombin time), and thus a 
 larger effect in other patients with moderate hepatic impairment cannot be excluded. 
 patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh c) were excluded from clinical trials.no 
 data is available in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>
 race most patients in the clinical trials (&gt; 92%) were caucasian, thus no conclusions on the impact of race on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics can be drawn. 
 age no clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

 there was a concentration-dependent induction trend in 2 of the 3 donors for cyp2b6. the results for

 observed were substantially lower than the effects of the positive controls. 
 cyp inhibition 
 study</p></section><section><header>pro3100nc24</header><p> evaluated the in vitro cyp inhibitory potential of mdv3100. cyp1a2, 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6 and 3a4/5 were studied in pooled liver microsomes with specific marker substrates. 
 mdv3100 concentrations from 0.04 to 39 
 μg/ml were used, and both reversible and time-dependent (30 minutes pre-incubation) was tested.</p><p>
 mdv3100 caused direct inhibition of cyp2b6,cyp2c8, cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 with ic50 values of 42 μm, 
 10 μm, 50 μm and 23 μm, for the other enzymes inhibitory ic50 was &gt;84 
 μm. the lowest ic50 were seen for cyp2c8 and cyp2c19, and the ki for these inhibitions were determined to be 5.5 and 8.6 
 μm, respectively. 
 a slight increase in inhibition potential with pre-incubation (time-dependent inhibition) was observed 
 for cyp1a2, but not for the other enzymes tested. further experiments performed showed that the 
 increase in inhibition did not require nadph but was not resistant to dilution, and the applicant 
 suggests that the time-dependent phenomenon may be due to the formation of a metabolite which is a 
 more potent cyp1a2 inhibitor.

 (predefined cutoff for a pgp substrate) in all experiments for both mdv3100 (&lt;1.3), m1 (&lt;1.7) and m2

 was concluded that mdv3100 is not a bcrp substrate.</p><p>
 in study</p></section><section><header>9785-me-0030</header><p> it was investigated whether mdv3100 is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters oatp1b1, oatp1b3 and oct1, by measuring mdv3100 uptake (1 and 10

 uptake in transporter tranfected cells was similar as in control cells, suggesting that mdv3100 is not a 
 substrate for oatp1b1, oatp1b3 and oct1. 
 mdv3100 as an inhibitor of transporters 
 the three studies above were also used to study inhibition of transport by mdv3100 of known

 μm, respectively. no inhibition was seen for m1 (ic50&gt;80 
 μm). for mrp2 and bcrp inhibition the transport of h-estradiol-17β-d-glucuronide and methotrexate were 
 studied in the absence or presence of mdv3100 (0.15-50

 inhibition of substrate transport with an ic50 within the tested concentration range was seen for 
 several of the transporters. 
 •</p></section><section><header>in vivo</header><p>effects of other substances on mdv3100</p><p>to elucidate the role of cyp2c8 and cyp3a4 in mdv3100 metabolism,</p></section><section><header>study 9785-cl-0006</header><p> was performed. it was a 3-arm parallel group study in 41 male healthy volunteers. one group was 
 randomised to a single oral 160 mg dose of mdv3100 and the other two groups were pre-treated with 
 either 600 mg gemfibrozil (cyp2c8 inhibitor) twice daily or 200 mg itraconazole (cyp3a4 inhibitor) 
 once daily for 3 days before and 18 days after receiving a 160 mg mdv3100 single dose. pk-samples 
 for analysing mdv3100, m1 and m2 were collected for 49 days after mdv3100 dose. primary 
 pharmacokinetic variable was cmax, aucinf and auc0-18 days for parent compound. 
 co-administration of gemfibrozil coincided with higher plasma concentrations and slower elimination of 
 mdv3100, whereas a more modest effect was seen of itraconazole. 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 38/86</p><p>
 after 18 days, when gemfibrozil administration was discontinued, the elimination rate of mdv3100 increased, and the plasma level of m2 started to rise. due to the concern that gemfibrozil 
 administration was too short to mirror the worst-case effect of a cyp2c8 inhibitor, the interaction was 
 quantified using compartmental modelling and simulation to predict the change with no discontinuation 
 of gemfibrozil. the result suggested a t/r ratio of 4.26 (90% ci 3.59-5.01). the t/r when comparing 
 auc for the first 18 days with noncompartmental methods was 2.53 (90% ci 2.19-2.91), and no 
 aucinf was calculated with non-compartmental methods. the effect of withdrawing itraconazole on the 
 plasma concentration time curve of mdv3100 was smaller, and thus aucinf was estimated using 
 standard non-compartmental methods. a small rise in m1 levels was seen when itraconazole was 
 discontinued.</p><p>
 gemfibrozil caused an increase in m1 (auc 2.7-fold higher) whereas the levels of m2 decreased by 
 25%. thus the effect of cyp2c8 inhibition on active moiety (parent+m2) is lower (2.2-fold) compared 
 to the effect of mdv3100 itself (4.3-fold). itraconazol, on the other hand, did not seem to affect m1 
 whereas the auc of m2 was slightly increased (20%). 
 effects of mdv3100 on other substances

 cyp2c19 and cyp3a4, study</p></section><section><header>9785-cl-0007</header><p> was performed.</p><p>it was an open-label, single-sequence cross-over study in 14 crpc patients, aiming to investigate the 
 effect of multiple once daily oral dosing (160 mg) of mdv3100</p><p>on the pk of a single dose of 
 pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate), warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate), and 
 midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate). 
 pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate) auc increased by 20% at steady-state administration with mdv3100, 
 whereas its metabolite oh-piglitazone had an auc decrease by 37%. the auc of the other three drugs 
 decreased – s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate) by 56%, omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate) by 70% and 
 midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate) by 86%. the applicant concludes that mdv3100 has no clinically 
 relevant effect on cyp2c8, but is a moderate inducer of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 and a strong inducer of

 mechanism of action</header><p>prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor signalling.</p><p>despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, ar signalling continues to 
 promote disease progression. stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor requires 
 nuclear localization and dna binding.</p><p>mdv3100 is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that 
 blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway.</p><p>mdv3100 competitively inhibits 
 binding of androgens to androgen receptors, inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and 
 inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with dna even in the setting of androgen 
 receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens.</p><p>mdv3100 treatment 
 decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression.</p><p>
 in preclinical studies mdv3100 lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.

 page 39/86</p></section><section><header>primary and secondary pharmacology</header><p>primary pharmacology crpc-mda-1 was a non-randomized, single arm, phase ii study with the objective of studying the 
 effect of mdv3100 treatment on androgen receptor signaling and expression of survival/resistance 
 pathways in the bone marrow metastases of patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate. 
 eligible were patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
 without neuroendocrine differentiation and who had presence of metastatic disease to the bone. the 
 study enrolled 60 patients (16 docetaxel chemotherapy-naïve patients and 44 patients who had had 
 prior docetaxel chemotherapy).</p><p>all patients received mdv3100 at a daily dose of 160 mg. paired bone 
 marrow samples (biopsy/aspirates) were collected prior to and after 8 weeks of mdv3100 therapy. the 
 analysis for androgen receptor expression required paired bone marrow samples to have interpretable 
 immunohistochemistry results and was conducted on 16 (26.7%) of patients. analysis of androgen 
 receptor expression and subcellular localization by immunohistochemistry in paired bone marrow 
 tumor samples at baseline and week 9 (n = 16) demonstrated reduction in nuclear androgen receptor 
 in all evaluable psa responders (n = 5) and two of the 11 psa non-responders.</p><p>a statistical correlation 
 was not assessed due to low numbers of evaluable patients. sampling of blood and bone marrow 
 biopsies showed that 160 mg daily of mdv3100 was associated with increases in both plasma and bone 
 marrow testosterone levels. a larger increase in mean plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone 
 was observed in the psa responder group though not statistically significant. there was an increase in 
 bone marrow testosterone (non significant) but not bone marrow dihydrotestosterone observed 
 compared to baseline. 
 secondary pharmacology 
 an independent review of ecgs in crpc2 was performed as a randomised, placebo controlled, triple-
 blind substudy, intended to be done on all randomised patients. the objectives were to determine the 
 effects of-mdv3100 on ecg changes as compared to placebo, and to exclude an effect of mdv3100-on 
 the qtc interval exceeding 10 ms at the 1-sided upper 95% confidence limit. according to ich e14, 
 this threshold was chosen to provide reasonable assurance that the mean effect of the study drug on 
 the qt/qtc interval is not greater than around 5 ms, because drugs that prolong the mean qt/qtc 
 interval by around 5 ms or less do not appear to cause torsades de pointes. 
 compared to placebo, treatment with 160 mg mdv3100 daily resulted in no clinically relevant changes 
 in heart rate, atrioventricular conduction as determined by the pr interval, or cardiac depolarization as 
 determined by the qrs duration.</p><p>the effect of mdv3100 on cardiac repolarization as determined by 
 the qtcf interval using pk/pd data suggests that there may be a 3 ms effect with an upper confidence 
 interval (ci) of ≤ 4 ms (crpc2).</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.  
 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>study crpc-mda-1 showed that in evaluable patients with a psa response, the shift from nuclear to cytoplasmic localization of the androgen receptor is consistent with non-clinical data showing that 
 mdv3100 blocks nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor. the increase in serum and bone 
 marrow testosterone levels is consistent with a potential adaptation of prostate cancer to overcome 
 mdv3100 androgen receptor axis blockade. 
 in relation to plasma concentration and effect, a daily dose of 160 mg appears sufficient for efficacy 
 studies considering effects on psa concentrations and the side-effect of fatigue. 
 the volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body water, indicative of 
 extensive extravascular distribution.</p><p>it seems that mdv3100 was preferentially retained in the plasma 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>

 component of blood (blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.55). mdv3100 and m2 cross the blood-brain barrier in mice and rats, achieving tissues concentrations equivalent to plasma. 
 in general, the metabolism of mdv3100 is sufficiently characterised, whereas it is recommended to the 
 applicant to further investigate the formation and elimination of the active metabolite m2 considering 
 its importance for efficacy and safety. the applicant has proposed a plan to identify the enzyme(s) 
 catalysing the metabolism of m2. upon identification of the enzymes, further interaction studies with 
 inhibitors or inducers may be needed. 
 the small effects of cyp2c8 polymorphism seen in the literature, together with the data provided on 
 cyp2c8 phenotypes in the 61 patients in the clinical trials and the rather small between-patient 
 variability in the phase iii trial suggest that cyp2c8 genetic polymorphism is not of clinical importance. 
 in addition, when the major enzymes responsible for m2 metabolism are identified, genetic 
 polymorphism needs to be taken into consideration if a polymorphic enzyme is found to be of 
 importance. 
 potential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures 
 cyp2c8 inhibitors and inducers cyp2c8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite.</p><p>following oral administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice 
 daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide increased by 326% while c
 max of enzalutamide decreased by 18%. the effect of drug-drug interactions on mdv3100 pharmacokinetics 
 was re-evaluated based on unbound (mean ex vivo fu of 1.7% and 2.8% of parent and m2) active 
 moiety. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased 
 by 77% while c
 max decreased by 19%.</p><p>strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of cyp2c8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>if patients must be 
 co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once 
 daily . 
 cyp3a4 inhibitors and inducers cyp3a4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide.</p><p>following oral administration of the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of 
 enzalutamide increased by 41% while c
 max was unchanged. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased by 27% while c
 max was again unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of cyp3a4. 
 potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products 
 enzyme induction enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of 
 enzymes or transporters is expected.</p><p>the reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and 
 lead to lost or reduced clinical effect.</p><p>there is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites.</p><p>
 enzymes that may be induced include cyp3a in the liver and gut, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp1a2 and 
 uridine 5&apos;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugts - glucuronide conjugating enzymes).</p><p>the 
 transport protein p-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug 
 resistance-associated protein 2 (mrp2), breast cancer resistant protein (bcrp) and the organic anion 
 transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1).</p><p>in vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4 and a moderate inducer of 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19.</p><p>co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral doses 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>

 page 41/86</p><p>
 of sensitive cyp substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the auc of midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the auc of s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), and a 
 70% decrease in the auc of omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate).</p><p>ugt1a1 may have been induced as 
 well.</p><p> 
 interactions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport 
 are expected.</p><p>if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments 
 are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal 
 products are to be avoided or used with caution.</p><p>the risk for liver injury after paracetamol 
 administration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers.</p><p>
 the full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start 
 of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some 
 induction effects may be apparent earlier.</p><p>patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of 
 cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp1a2 or ugt1a1 should be evaluated for possible loss of 
 pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during 
 the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate.</p><p>
 in consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for 
 one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide.</p><p>a gradual dose reduction of the concomitant 
 medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. 
 cyp2c8 substrates enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the auc or cmax of pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate).</p><p>the auc of pioglitazone increased by 20% while c
 max decreased by 18%.</p><p>no dose adjustment is indicated when a cyp2c8 substrate is co-administered with xtandi. 
 p-gp substrates</p><p>in vitro</p><p>data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-gp.</p><p>the effect of enzalutamide on p-gp substrates has not been evaluated 
 in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer of p-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor 
 (pxr).</p><p>medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for p-gp (e.g. 
 colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly 
 with xtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations. 
 bcrp, mrp2, oat3 and oct1 substrates</p><p>based on in vitro data, inhibition of bcrp and mrp2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. 
 theoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown. 
 in order to clarify whether enzalutamide would act as and inducer (or inhibitor) of cyp1a2 in vivo, the 
 applicant plans to perform a clinical study to investigate the effect of enzalutamide on a specific 
 cyp1a2-substrate.</p><p>
 it seems probable that enzalutamide can induce cyp2b6 in vivo, but since clinically relevant specific 
 cyp2b6 substrates are rare, in vivo studies of cyp2b6 are not requested at this point. since induction 
 through pxr/car seems probable, there may be a risk of induction also of e g pgp and ugt1a1. the 
 applicant agrees that there is a risk for induction also of transporters (e g pgp, mrp2, mrp3 and 
 oatp1a2).</p><p>
 the solubility of mdv3100 is increased with ccmg (an emulsifier/surfactant). it is unfortunate that the 
 interaction study was performed with ccmg in the placebo treatment, meaning that the potential 
 additional interaction effects of ccmg are not studied. the applicant has performed an ambitious

 comparison with literature data, concluding that an inhibition of intestinal pgp cannot be excluded. caution for pgp substrate is present in the smpc. 
 the small effect of food on absorption rate can be considered clinically irrelevant for maintenance 
 dosing of a drug with long half-life. no food restrictions are considered necessary, and in the pivotal 
 clinical studies the drug has been taken regardless of food intake. 
 the recovery in the mass balance study (85%) was somewhat low, but acceptable in view of the long 
 half-life and the long sampling period in the study, and more than 80% of the recovered radioactivity 
 was identified. 
 special population 
 in the clinical study performed in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment study, patients 
 with moderate hepatic impairment are not considered to be fully representative and caution should 
 therefore be advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. the applicant has committed to 
 conduct a new clinical study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (as reflected in the rmp) 
 and this issue will be further discussed in light of the results of this study to be submitted by december 
 2015. 
 there are no data in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. caution is therefore advised in 
 patients with severe renal impairment and no major increase in active moiety is expected. in order to 
 provide further information on the safety in this patient population, the applicant committed to conduct 
 a study in patients with severe hepatic impairment and to submit the results by november 2014.</p><p>in 
 the meantime, taking into consideration that mdv3100 and its active metabolite are eliminated 
 primary by hepatic metabolism, the low grade of moderate impairment in the pk study (9785-cl-
 0009), and the absence of data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, mdv3100 should not be 
 recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
 ecg and specifically qt data obtained in the setting of the crpc2 study did not raise any clinically 
 relevant safety concerns.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.5">2.4.5.  
 conclusions on clinical pharmacology</header><p>in general, the pharmacokinetics of mdv3100 is well described. the metabolism and elimination of the active metabolite m2 needs to be elucidated further and the applicant committed to conduct necessary 
 studies post-approval. mdv3100 is a strong to moderate enzyme inducer, which needs further 
 considerations when it comes to extrapolation to enzymes, and transporters that are not studied in 
 vivo and recommendations in the smpc.</p></section><section><header n="2.5">2.5.

 both pre- and post-chemotherapy.</p><p>the key roles of this study in the development plan were to 
 determine the maximum tolerated dose and initial safety profile of mdv3100, to provide data on the 
 pk of mdv3100, to identify evidence of an anti-tumor effect, and if observed, to determine the optimal 
 dose to move forward into phase 3 clinical evaluation.</p><p>
 140 patients were enrolled (65 chemotherapy-naïve patients; 75 patients who had received prior 
 chemotherapy).</p><p>doses of 30, 60, 150, 240, 360, 480, and 600 mg/day were studied in 7 cohorts of 
 patients. patients must have demonstrated progression defined as 1 or more of the following 3 criteria:</p><p>
 progression as defined by the recist; progression as defined by a minimum of 3 rising psa levels with

 an interval of ≥ 1 week between each determination; and/or progression as defined by 2 or more new lesions on bone scan.</p><p>patients previously treated with chemotherapy must have not had more than 2 
 prior chemotherapy regimens 1 of which was docetaxel-based.</p><p>patients not previously treated with

 analyses included a description of the changes in psa, progression on imaging, circulating tumor cell 
 counts, bone turnover markers (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary n-telopeptide) 
 and the frequency and timing of disease progression following 12 weeks of treatment with mdv3100.</p><p>
 in this study mdv3100 psa decreases occurred at all doses and in men with and without previous 
 chemotherapy. the extent and proportion of patients showing psa decreases appeared to be dose-
 dependent from 30 mg to 150 mg daily, but reached a plateau between 150 mg and 240 mg daily, 
 above which were seen no additional effects. the proportion of patients showing a 50% reduction from 
 baseline in psa increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 150 mg/day (33.3% of patients at 
 30 mg/day, 59.3% at 60 mg/day and 66.7% at 150 mg/day) with no obvious additional benefit 
 recorded for increased doses above 150 mg daily day (58.6% at 240 mg/day, 67.9% at 360 mg/day, 
 28.6% at 480 mg/day, and 66.7% at 600 mg/day).

 the protocol-specific modifications to the pcwg2 criteria were: for nodal disease, only lymph nodes ≥ 
 1.5 cm in (short axis) diameter at screening were used to assess for a change in size; and directed 
 pelvic imaging to document presence or absence of disease at screening was not required. progression 
 at the first scheduled reassessment at week 13 required a confirmatory scan 6 or more weeks later. 
 confirmatory scans had to show progressively worsening disease (e.g., at least 2 new lesions on bone 
 scan, or progressive disease by recist v1.1 on soft tissue imaging by ct or mri). patients were 
 instructed to continue on treatment until this confirmatory scan was performed to document 
 radiographic disease progression and the patient was scheduled to initiate another systemic 
 antineoplastic therapy. increases in psa, especially during the first 12 weeks of therapy, were not 
 considered disease progression.

 according to the consensus guidelines of the pcwg2,</p><p>psa progression: 
 • ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/ml above the nadir, with confirmation by a second consecutive value obtained ≥ 3 weeks later;</p><p>
 • for patients with no psa decline at week 13, the psa progression date was defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 
 ng/ml above the baseline was documented, which was confirmed by a 
 second consecutive value 3 or more weeks later.</p><p>

 • bone disease: appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scan</p><p>
 • soft tissue disease: as defined by recist v1.1 on ct/mri</p><p>
 unless warranted sooner, disease progression was first assessed (by the 
 investigator) at week 13 and if deemed present then to be confirmed at least 6 
 weeks later. disease progression was assessed again at week 25 and then every 
 12 weeks until death.</p></section><section><header>time to first skeletal-

 patients were assessed for skeletal-related events at all study visits, long-term 
 follow-up visits, safety follow-up visits, and survival follow-up telephone calls. 
 the assessment of radiographic disease progression was asking the patient, 
 patient’s family, or patient’s regular physician about the occurrence of skeletal-

 “functional well-being,” and “additional concerns”). each item can be answered on 
 a scale of 0–4. the sum of scores on all 5 domains constitutes the fact-p.</p><p>
 patients were defined as having a positive quality of life response if they had a 10-

 consecutive measurements obtained at least 3 weeks apart. fact-p was assessed 
 at baseline and then at every regular study visit beginning at week 13.</p><p>

 page 48/86</p><p>note: protocol defines response as a 16-point improvement in global fact-p score, however, during the conduct of this trial, data became available showing 
 that a 6–10 point improvement in the global fact-p score represented a clinically 
 meaningful change (cella, 2009) and sap was modified accordingly.</p></section><section><header>pain palliation</header><p>to be eligible for this analysis, patients must have had:</p><p>
 • metastatic bone disease at baseline; • provided answers to bpi-sf q#3 for a minimum of 4 out of 7 days in the baseline run-in period; 
 • had stable baseline pain (≤ 2-point variation in daily pain scores); • had stable analgesic use (≤ 30% variation in analgesic use); • had an average pain score during the baseline run-in period ≥ 4.</p><p>
 pain palliation was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction in average pain score at week 13 
 compared to baseline with a ≤ 30% increase in analgesic use.</p><p>
 patients filled the questionnaire on their own (their responses should apply to the 
 7-day period preceding their screening or week 13 visit).</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>the sample size for this study was determined as follows: an observed 650 deaths provided approximately 90% power to detect a 3.7 month difference in median survival (estimated median 
 survival for placebo = 12 months; estimated median survival for mdv3100 = 15.7 months; target 
 hazard ratio of 0.76), using a 2-sided log-rank test with a 0.05 level of significance. assuming all 
 patients were followed for survival, the study required approximately 1080 patients (720 mdv3100-
 treated patients, 360 placebo-treated patients) to achieve the targeted 650 deaths. a survival analysis 
 was to be performed when 650 events of death were observed. to allow for up to 8% lost to follow-up, 
 the sample size was set at 1170 patients (780 mdv3100-treated patients, 390 placebo-treated 
 patients).</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>patients were randomised to mdv3100 or placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, using a centrally administered, randomized, permuted block method and stratified by the following factors: 
 • baseline ecog performance status score (0–1 vs. 2); • baseline mean brief pain inventory – short form question #3 score averaged over the 7 days prior to randomization (&lt; 4 vs. ≥ 4).</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>the mdv3100 and placebo capsules were identical in regards to appearance, number of capsules/day, and formulation (gelatin capsules containing ccmg). all patients, investigators, site personnel, and the 
 sponsor’s staff involved in the conduct of the study were blinded to treatment assignment. study 
 treatment assignment could be unblinded when a participant experienced progressive disease and 
 when the knowledge of treatment assignment could make a difference in subsequent treatment (e.g., 
 if the patient wanted to participate in a clinical study which excluded prior mdv3100 therapy).</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>interim analysis xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/383457/2013</p><p>
 page 49/86</p><p>
 a single formal interim overall survival analysis was conducted on event data through the date of the 520th death event (80% of the 650 target number of deaths) by the independent statistical unit. 
 primary efficacy analysis 
 a log-rank test stratified by baseline ecog performance status and mean brief pain inventory – short 
 form score (question #3) was used to compare the mdv3100-treated and placebo groups. this 
 comparison was a 2-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance. kaplan-meier median survival times 
 and their 95% cis as well as survival curves were used for statistical description. 
 additionally, the benefit of mdv3100 compared to placebo was evaluated by a single hazard ratio 
 (mdv3100/placebo) with its 95% ci based on a stratified cox regression model. a sensitivity analysis 
 for overall survival was conducted using an unstratified log-rank test. a single hazard ratio 
 (mdv3100/placebo) with its 95% ci based on an unstratified cox regression model was also provided. 
 pre-specified subgroup analyses of overall survival were performed to determine whether the 
 treatment effect was concordant among subgroups. 
 key secondary efficacy analyses 
 the key secondary analyses were: 
 • comparison of time to psa progression between treatment arms; • comparison of duration of radiographic progression-free survival between treatment arms; • comparison of time to first skeletal-related event between treatment arms. the key secondary analyses were to be performed only if mdv3100 therapy resulted in a statistically 
 significant prolongation of overall survival at the time of the interim analysis (2-sided p &lt; 0.0244) or at 
 the final analysis (2-sided p &lt; 0.0429). the testing of the key secondary endpoints was conducted in 
 the fixed sequence listed above such that if statistical significance (2-sided p &lt; 0.05) was not achieved 
 for 1 of the endpoints, all key secondary endpoints following in the sequence were not to be considered 
 statistically significant for purposes of regulatory evaluation.

 the protocol. a final protocol was produced on april 19, 2011. 
 the main amendments pertained to:</p><p>
 • dose reduction from 240 mg/day to 160 mg/day based on data from the phase i s-3100-1-01 study showing comparable efficacy with improved safety profile at the lower dose (amendment 
 1). this amendment was effective prior to the enrollment of any patient (30 july 2009). 
 • the addition of an interim analysis at approximately 520 deaths and the reduction of the number of death events required for the final analysis from 786 to 650 (amendment 3).</p><p>

 maturity). the date of the 520
 th death (25 september 2011) was used as the analysis data cut-off date. stratified analysis of overall survival showed a statistically significant increase in the duration of 
 survival among patients treated with mdv3100 as compared to placebo with a median overall benefit 
 of 4.8 months in favour of the mdv3100-treated patients and corresponding to an approximately 37 % 
 decrease in the risk of death table 15). kaplan-meier curves for duration of survival are shown in 
 figure 02. to be noted is the uncertainty with respect to the mdv3100 arm around the median 
 estimate. 
 based on these results the independent data monitoring committee (idmc) recommended the study 
 to be halted and the patients in the placebo arm to be proffered to receive mdv3100. the study blind 
 was maintained until database lock on 16 december 2011.

 at database closure, there were 344 (43.0%) deaths in the mdv3100 arm and 232 (58.1%) deaths in 
 the placebo arm (48% of total events). the hazard ratio for death (95% ci) for mdv3100-treated 
 patients from a stratified cox regression model was 0.620 (95% ci: 0.525, 0.733).</p><p>
 to ascertain whether subsequent therapies following progression on study drug may have influenced 
 the survival results, post-progression therapies were investigated. the analysis showed that 
 administration of subsequent therapies for prostate cancer was consistently higher in patients receiving 
 placebo as compared with patients receiving mdv3100.</p><p>
 the number of patients taking at least one subsequent therapy were 336 (42.0%) in the mdv3100 arm 
 as compared to 245 (61.4%) in the placebo arm and it was mainly consistent regardless of the 
 different regimens administered. this included the two recently approved second-line treatments for 
 crpc, abiraterone (20.9% of patients in the mdv3100 arm vs. 24.3% in the placebo arm) and 
 cabazitaxel (9.8% vs. 13.8%).</p><p>
 as supportive analyses, overall survival was examined in patient subgroups. the following subgroups 
 were selected for this analysis because they were either accepted prognostic factors for prostate 
 cancer, demographic features of interest, or represent different regional practice patterns: 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/383457/2013</p><p>
 page 59/86</p><p>the results by baseline risk factors were all consistent with the results for the randomized population.</p><p>results of the pre-planned interim analysis (25 september 2011) despite clearly positive, were 
 considered of borderline maturity as they were based on events in 43% of the total study population. 
 in spite of the unquantifiable impact that cross-over of patients may have the company was requested 
 to submit as much information on os as possible.</p><p>beyond the date database lock on 16 december 
 2011 the company submitted two additional updated analyses on os: 
 - one at the time of a safety update for the fda (jan-2012) when 645 events had occurred, which 
 represent events in 54% of the total study population (99% of the total targeted events), results 
 remain in the same trend: hr: 0.672 (95%ci: 0.573-0.788) and a difference of 4.8 months in median 
 time to death was observed. this result constitutes a reliable estimate of os. in spite of the open-label 
 nature of the trial at this point, os is a robust endpoint that can hardly be biased by factors such as 
 blinding; furthermore no patient had been crossed-over to placebo so far.</p><p>
 - an additional analysis has been submitted based on data cut-off of 29-june-2012, when 734 events 
 had been reported (61.2% of the total study population) and only 22 patients were crossed to active 
 treatment arm. again, results remain in the same line: hr: 0.696 (95%ci: 0.599-0.809) and a 
 difference of 4.9 months in median time to death was observed. albeit bias cannot be ruled out and 
 results are not fully reliable the impact of 22 patients crossed to active treatment can be considered 
 minimal (surprisingly only 22 patients have been crossed over to active treatment arm 6 months after 
 the database was locked). 
 overall, results are reassuring and more mature than the initially reported results. as per the data 
 provided the effect of mdv3100 in the target population is consistent and relevant from a clinical point 
 of view.

 the key secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically in a pre-specified rank order, such that if 
 statistical significance was not achieved for 1 of the endpoints, the following endpoints in sequence 
 would not be analysed.</p><p>

 and conducted at least three weeks later. patients who were not determined to have psa progression 
 were censored at the date of the last assessment showing no evidence of psa progression.</p><p>
 a total of 400 patients in the mdv3100 arm and 190 patients in the placebo arm experienced psa 
 progression on study and 400 subjects and 209 subjects respectively were censored. 
 50.0 % of patients in the mdv3100 arm and 52.4% of patients in the placebo arm were censored with 
 respect to time to psa progression. of them, 8.6% and 17.3% respectively were lost to follow-up (no 
 psa post-baseline). all other censored data were due to the lack of observed confirmation of psa 
 progression.</p><p>

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of the trial</header><p>one single pivotal trial, study crpc2, has been submitted in support of the efficacy of mdv3100 in patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) in a population who had 
 progressed after 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens at least one docetaxel-based.</p><p>
 at the time the study was initiated there was not an established standard of care, thus a placebo 
 control study is deemed acceptable, despite outcomes of this trial may be discussed within the context 
 of the current clinical practice (i.e. abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have both shown benefit in 
 terms of os in the same target population).</p><p>
 baseline characteristics properly define target population; however some exceptions have been 
 highlighted. on the one hand, black race is underrepresented. on the other hand the number of 
 patients entering with a baseline ecog-ps=2 was low and one could wonder whether efficacy could be 
 the same in this most damaged population, subgroup analyses somehow clarified this issue, though 
 uncertainties regarding the low number of patients included remain. both patients of non-white race 
 and those with ecog ps ≥ 2 have been included as missing information in the rmp.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>at the time of data cut-off of the pre-planned interim analysis (25 september 2011) results showed a significant improvement in terms of the primary endpoint overall survival (os): median time of 
 xtandi chmp assessment report</p><p>

 survival was improved in 4.8 months; median time was 18.4 in the mdv3100 arm and 13.6 months in placebo arm (hr: 0.633; 95%ci:0.531, 0.754; p&lt; 0.0001).</p><p> 
 additionally analyses have been conducted in different subgroups showing consistent results. 
 the key secondary endpoints were comparison between treatment arms in relation to time to psa 
 progression, duration of radiographic pfs and time to first skeletal-related event. a statistically 
 significant increase in time to psa progression was observed among mdv3100-treated patients 
 compared with placebo with a benefit of 5.3 months and corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.248 
 (95% ci: 0.204, 0.303). in addition, the key secondary endpoint radiographic progression-free 
 survival that encompassed progression in soft tissue as well as in bone disease, showed a median 
 benefit of 5.4 months in favour for the mdv3100 arm compared to placebo. the hazard ratio was 
 0.404 (95% ci: 0.350, 0.466).</p><p> 
 the analysis of time to first skeletal-related events revealed a statistically significant increase in favour 
 of the</p><p>mdv3100-treated patients compared with placebo with a benefit of 3.4 months with a hazard 
 ratio of 0.688 (95% ci: 0.566, 0.835).</p><p>
 furthermore, psa response rate measured by ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% psa reduction from baseline was 
 assessed. the difference in response rate was 52.5% and 23.9% respectively in favour of mdv3100 
 compared to placebo. both levels were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001).</p></section><section><header n="2.5.4">2.5.4.

 clinical safety</header><p>the safety data to support the use of mdv3100 in the proposed indication is based mainly on the pivotal randomised study crpc2 [800 patients treated with mdv3100 and 399 patients treated with

 note: events/100 patient-years data are obtained from the crpc2 clinical study report; adverse events were coded 
 using an earlier version of meddra than used in the summary of clinical safety analyses. 
 as the median duration of exposure was substantially longer in the experimental arm, 8.3 months vs. 3.0 months in the placebo arm, the absolute frequencies of aes may not be relevant for comparison. 
 therefore, aes occurring during the first 60 days and events per 100 patient years were analysed, 
 considered more appropriate than the total ae incidence comparison. among aes reported in ≥5% of 
 patients in any treatment group only hot flush, headache and hypertension occurred more commonly 
 in the mdv3100 group in both of these analyses.</p></section><section><header>comments on selected aes</header><p>• fatigue total incidence of fatigue was higher in the experimental arm of crpc2 and a dose-related finding in 
 the open-labelled studies, and also showed a positive correlation with exposure to active drug and 
 metabolite. however, in the time-normalised analyses, fatigue in the mdv3100 arm of crpc2 was 
 reported at similar or lower frequency than in the placebo arm. grade ≥3 events occurred at a lower 
 incidence in the mdv3100 arm. at the intended dose, 160 mg daily, data does not support a clear 
 relationship between mdv3100 and fatigue/asthenia 
 • neutropenia while neutrophil levels remained constant over time in the placebo arm of the pivotal study a modest 
 decline of neutrophil counts with nadir at week 5 was noted in the mdv3100 arm. the maximum 
 decrease of 700/µl is considered clinically relevant.</p><p>
 • non-pathological fracture non-pathological fracture was reported more frequently in the mdv3100 arm in crpc2, also in a time-
 normalised analysis (5.6 vs. 1.8 events per 100 patient years). 
 • seizure mdv3100 penetrates the blood brain barrier and has been associated with a potential for seizure in 
 preclinical studies, possibly through binding to the gaba receptor. in the clinical setting, seizure was a 
 dlt in the dose-finding study and pk data support the relation to dose. a total of 13 mdv3100 treated 
 patients experiencing seizure is reported in the scs at the cut-off at 31 january 2012 whereof 10 at a 
 150/160 mg daily dose and 7/800 (0.9%) in the crpc2 study. the seizures spanned from partial to 
 generalised and occurred without relation to treatment time, from day 26 to 601 with a median of day 
 66. potentially contributing factors were present in 8 of the patients.

 time to first grade ≥3 event was longer in the mdv3100 arm, 12.6 vs. 4.2 months. decreased 
 appetite, back pain, pathological fracture, metastatic pain and spinal cord compression of grade ≥3 
 were reported more commonly in the mdv3100 group but out of these only grade ≥3 decreased 
 appetite and back pain occurred at a higher frequency within 60 days of treatment, as did also grade 
 ≥3 hypertension. 
 taking grouped aes and differences in duration of treatment into consideration, metastatic pain, back 
 pain, decreased appetite, pathological fracture and spinal cord compression are unlikely to represent 
 safety signals.</p></section><section><header>adrs</header><p>the adverse events identified in study crpc2 for which a causal relationship with enzalutamide is at least a reasonable possibility are described in table 21.

 respectively. a dose-dependent pattern of increased incidence of all these ae categories was noted in 
 the integrated safety population. 
 fatigue was the only ae leading to temporary discontinuation of dosing that was more common in the 
 mdv3100 treatment group. no aes leading to dose reduction occurred in more than 1% of patients in 
 either treatment group.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.1">2.6.1.  
 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>in nonclinical studies, convulsions, anaemia, reproductive toxicity, endocrine reactions, and gastrointestinal reactions were identified as potential risks of mdv3100. in the clinical studies, patients 
 at risk of seizure were excluded. seizure was always to be reported as sae. 
 the safety database encompasses a total of 1027 patients treated with mdv3100, whereof 923 with 
 the target daily dose of 160 mg. randomised placebo-controlled data is available for 800 patients, 
 considered</p><p>to reflect the target population, with this dose. these numbers are considered sufficient for 
 assessment although safety remains to be addressed in several subgroups. 
 when looking at frequency of aes in the crpc2 study, despite the substantially longer treatment 
 duration in the experimental arm, fractions of patients with any ae were roughly similar between study 
 arms while aes grade 
 ≥3, saes, aes leading to death, aes as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug, aes leading to temporary discontinuation of dosing and aes leading to 
 dose reduction were all consistently numerically lower in the experimental arm. thus, in terms of 
 frequency, these figures are reassuring from a safety point of view and also indicate that the safety 
 profile of mdv3100 is overall acceptable. 
 of note, psychiatric and nervous system disorders are special characteristics for this treatment, paying 
 special attention to seizure. seizures were reported in 0.9% of patients on mdv3100 in crpc2, despite 
 exclusion of patients with baseline factors potentially associated with increased risk of seizure 
 (including but not limited to underlying brain injury, stroke, primary brain tumours or brain 
 metastases, or alcoholism), and spanned from partial to generalised events and occurred without 
 relation to treatment time. the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receiving concomitant 
 medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. the potential of mdv3100 to induce seizure is 
 supported by preclinical and pk data. given that this is an oral medicinal product, most cases would 
 occur out of hospital.</p><p>
 the measures implemented to minimise the risk of seizures are considered acceptable as reflected in 
 the rmp. the applicant will conduct a post-authorisation safety study that will provide further 
 information to update risk mitigation recommendations. the applicant is recommended to consider the 
 points mentioned in section 2.7 for the finalisation of the study protocol.</p><p>
 a warning regarding the risk for seizure was included in sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the 
 smpc.</p><p>

 no clinically significant signals regarding, thromboembolic, hepatic and renal events or deterioration of renal or liver function tests were identified. however, taking into account the lack of data in severe 
 renal patients and the inconclusive results with moderate hepatic impairment patients, caution is 
 recommended in this population in section 4.4 of the smpc. regarding severe hepatic impairment, it 
 should be taken into consideration that mdv3100 and its active metabolite are eliminated primarily by 
 hepatic metabolism, the low grade of moderate impairment in the pk study (9785-cl-0009) and the 
 absence of data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. for all the above mentioned reasons, 
 mdv3100 is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) (see 
 section 4.4 of the smpc). 
 enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used 
 medicinal products.</p><p>a review of concomitant medicinal products should therefore be conducted when 
 initiating enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>concomitant use of enzalutamide with medicinal products that are 
 sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters should generally be avoided if their 
 therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and if dose adjustments cannot easily be 
 performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations. 
 co-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided.</p><p>if enzalutamide 
 is co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by cyp2c9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), 
 additional international normalised ratio (inr) monitoring should be conducted. 
 no data are available on the concomitant use of enzalutamide with cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 crpc2 study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or unstable 
 angina (in the past 3 months), new york heart association class (nyha) iii or iv heart failure except 
 if left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ≥ 45%, long qt, qtcf &gt; 470 ms, bradycardia or 
 uncontrolled hypertension. this should be therefore taken into account when prescribing enzalutamide 
 in these patients (see section 4.5 of the smpc). 
 no clinical signs reflecting adrenal cortical hypertrophy with functional consequences or pituitary 
 hyperplasia are identified.</p><p>
 data on safety of mdv3100 in the treatment of patients with ecog ps ≥2 or of non-caucasian race is 
 scarce. this has been reflected in the smpc and the rmp. 
 the crpc2 safety database comprising 568 patients ≥65 years and 199 patients ≥75 years is 
 considered reasonably sufficient for assessment. 
 there are no human data on the use of xtandi in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use in 
 women of childbearing potential. 
 the imbalance seen in various adverse events within the soc of infections and infestations was not considered causally related to mdv3100 but attributed to the longer duration of 
 safety follow-up leading to observations of more common respiratory and other types of 
 infections in the mdv3100 arm. the chmp considers that there is insufficient evidence to 
 include “infections” as an adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the smpc. 
 studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. it is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen.</p><p>a condom is therefore required during and for 3 months after 
 treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman.</p><p>if the 
 patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another 
 form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment.

 conclusions on the clinical safety</header><p>the safety profile of mdv3100 160 mg daily has been sufficiently characterised in the target population. the side effects are mainly, but not exclusively, attributable to androgen blockade and 
 certain unexpected events that potentially may constitute adverse drug reactions should be further 
 addressed (addressed in the rmp). 
 the safety profile is considered acceptable and generally manageable with basic medical interventions 
 (diuretics and antihypertensive medication). toxicities were generally mild, and resulted in infrequent 
 dose reductions, dose interruptions, or discontinuations.</p><p>
 however, the main concerns are about psychiatric and nervous system disorder, paying special 
 attention to seizure. as it is an oral medicinal product, seizures are expected to occur out of hospital in 
 the majority of cases. in order to prevent or minimise this risk, an effort to further characterise 
 patients at risk should be done. in this sense, the measures implemented to minimise the risk of 
 seizures are considered acceptable (as reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the smpc and in the rmp).

 a full assessment of the proposed study to assess the safety of enzalutamide in patients excluded from 
 the pivotal study due to certain baseline factors considered predisposing for seizure will take place 
 when the final protocol is available. the applicant is recommended to consider the points mentioned 
 below: 
 - first, the selected study population is critical in relation to presently proposed as well as potential future wordings of smpc 4.3 and 4.4. it is noted that “patients with a history of 
 seizures should not have had a seizure within 12 months of screening and must have had no 
 anticonvulsants for 12 months prior to screening” to be eligible for study participation. 
 however, it is not clear whether this constitutes a safety precaution or whether it serves to 
 increase the sensitivity of the study. anyway, exclusion of this patient category may impact on 
 the wording of the smpc. 
 - second, considering that a substantial fraction of seizures in the previous experience have occurred at time points later than 4 months of treatment, it could be discussed whether the 
 proposed 4-month treatment period is sufficient. 
 - third, a plan for putting study data into perspective and so allowing its interpretation is lacking.

 at the time of data cut-off of the pre-planned interim analysis (25 september 2011; date of the 520
 th death event) results showed a significant improvement in terms of the primary endpoint os: a benefit of 4.8 months compared to placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.631 (95 % ci: 0.529; 0.752). a survival 
 benefit of this magnitude is rightfully deemed clinically meaningful considering the population 
 consisting of patients with late stage disease.</p><p>
 analyses with respect to whether post-progression therapies could have had any influence on the 
 survival results revealed that a higher frequency of subsequent therapies were received by patients in 
 the placebo group and was mainly consistent across all the different post-progression regimens 
 administered. this supports the assumption that the treatment benefit is attributable to the study 
 drug.</p><p>
 results are robust after adjusting by stratification factors (pain by bpi-sf at baseline and ecog-ps) 
 and when taking into account an updated analysis performed at the time of database lock (16 
 december 2011; 576 death events).</p><p>
 treatment effect on os was also consistently favourable in several subgroups based on prognostic 
 factors for prostate cancer; demographic features of interest or representing different regional practice 
 patterns. 
 the key secondary endpoints further supports the efficacy results even though the magnitude of the 
 mdv3100 benefit with respect to time to psa progression might be somewhat overestimated and 
 although rate of censored patients is remarkably high concerns pertaining this issue were clarified.

 synergistic mechanism of action or cross-resistance are currently unknown. in order to address this 
 risk, the applicant will provide further data from a single-arm study to assess efficacy and safety of

 finally, mdv3100 has inducing effects on several metabolic enzymes and possibly also transporters, 
 studies have shown strong induction of cyp3a4 and moderate induction of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19. 
 additional clinical study to investigate the effect of enzalutamide on a specific cyp1a2-substrate will be 
 performed. this needs to be taken into account when co-administering mdv3100 with other drugs 
 since prostate cancer patients should be treated with concomitant therapies. these recommendations 
 are reflected adequately in the smpc.</p></section><section><header>uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</header><p>the major safety uncertainty related to mdv3100 is considered so far to be the unknown incidence of seizure in patients with certain baseline factors potentially predisposing to this event, i.e. patients that, 
 considering the age of the target population, inevitably will be encountered in the real-life situation. 
 therefore, measures have been included in the rmp in order to address this risk.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>treatment with mdv3100 resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction of the risk of death (37% relative risk reduction). an improvement in the median overall survival of 4.8 
 months was observed. time to psa progression and radiologic progression free survival were also 
 significantly improved in favour of active treatment and time to first skeletal-related event also 
 favoured mdv3100.</p><p>
 overall, the benefits of mdv3100 in mcrpc patients who had progressed after 1 or 2 chemotherapy 
 regimens at least one containing docetaxel appear clear, robust and of clinical relevance. 
 the safety profile is considered acceptable and generally manageable with basic medical interventions 
 (diuretics and antihypertensive medication). toxicities were generally mild, and resulted in infrequent 
 dose reductions, dose interruptions, or discontinuations.</p><p>
 all identified risks, potential risks and missing information are adequately reflected and addressed in 
 the rmp.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance</header><p>the antitumor effect of mdv3100 has been clearly demonstrated, leading to an increase in the life expectancy with a safety profile overall acceptable and generally manageable.

 least one containing docetaxel, is considered positive. 
 cabazitaxel and abiraterone acetate were granted an indication in castration resistant prostate cancer 
 in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen. 
 prednisone 10 mg was used in both experimental and comparator arms in both studies. currently, 
 there are no direct comparative data about the relative efficacy or safety of these agents and 
 enzalutamide.</p><p> 
 mdv3100 opens the door to new possibilities regarding the possible synergic effect of both mdv3100 
 and abiraterone acetate in combination for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate 
 cancer. in this regard, a phase 2 study determining safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in 
 combination with abiraterone acetate in mcrpc patients is currently ongoing (nct01650194).</p></section><section><header n="4">4. 
 recommendations</header></section><section><header>outcome</header><p>based on the chmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the chmp considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of xtandi in the treatment of adult men with metastatic 
 castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy, is 
 favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
 following conditions:</p></section><section><header>conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use</header><p>medicinal product subject to medical prescription</p></section><section><header>conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation</header><p>•</p></section><section><header>periodic safety update reports</header><p>the marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 8 months following authorisation. subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit 
 periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of 
 union reference dates (eurd list) provided for under article 107c(7) of directive 2001/83/ec and 
 published on the european medicines web-portal.</p></section><section><header>conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product</header><p>•</p></section><section><header>risk management plan (rmp)</header><p>the mah shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed rmp presented in module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
 updates of the rmp.</p><p>when the submission of a psur and the update of a rmp coincide, they should be submitted at the

 same time. in addition, an updated rmp should be submitted: 
 • at the request of the european medicines agency; • whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
 an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.</p></section><section><header>new active substance status</header><p>based on the chmp review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the chmp considers that enzalutamide is qualified as a new active substance.</p><p>
