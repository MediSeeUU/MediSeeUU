 • the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>posology the recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose.</p><p>
 medical castration with an lhrh analogue should be continued during treatment of patients not 
 surgically castrated.</p><p>
 if a patient misses taking xtandi</p><p>at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as 
 possible to the usual time. if a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the 
 following day with the usual daily dose.</p><p>
 if a patient experiences a ≥ grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be 
 withheld for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced 
 dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p><p>
 3 concomitant use with strong cyp2c8 inhibitors the concomitant use of strong cyp2c8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg 
 once daily. if co-administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose 
 should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 older people no dose adjustment is necessary for older people (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</p><p>
 hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a). caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class b). xtandi is not 
 recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) (see section 4.4 and 
 5.2).</p><p>
 renal impairment no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 paediatric population there is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p><p>
 method of administration</p><p>
 xtandi is for oral use. the capsules should be swallowed whole with water, and can be taken with or 
 without food.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p><p>
 women who are or may become pregnant (see section 4.6).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>risk of seizure caution should be used in administering xtandi to patients with a history of seizures or other 
 predisposing factors including, but not limited to, underlying brain injury, stroke, primary brain 
 tumours or brain metastases, or alcoholism. in addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients 
 receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold.</p><p>
 concomitant use with other medicinal products 
 enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used 
 medicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). a review of concomitant medicinal products should 
 therefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. concomitant use of enzalutamide with 
 medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see 
 section 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, 
 and if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma 
 concentrations.</p><p>
 co-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. if xtandi is 
 co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by cyp2c9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), 
 additional international normalised ratio (inr) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 4 renal impairment caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in 
 this patient population.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 caution is required in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class b) as data in 
 moderate hepatic impairment are not fully conclusive (see section 5.2). as there are no data in patients 
 with severe hepatic impairment and enzalutamide is primarily hepatically eliminated, xtandi is not 
 recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c).</p><p>
 recent cardiovascular disease 
 the phase 3 studies excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or 
 unstable angina (in the past 3 months), new york heart association class (nyha) iii or iv heart 
 failure except if left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ≥ 45%, bradycardia or uncontrolled 
 hypertension. this should be taken into account if xtandi is prescribed in these patients.</p><p>
 use with chemotherapy 
 the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been 
 established. co-administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant effect on the 
 pharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel (see section 4.5); however, an increase in the occurrence of 
 docetaxel-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 excipients 
 xtandi contains sorbitol (e420). patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should 
 not take this medicinal product.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>potential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures</p><p>cyp2c8 inhibitors and inducers cyp2c8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. following oral administration of the strong cyp2c8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice 
 daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of enzalutamide increased by 326% while c
 max of enzalutamide decreased by 18%. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active 
 metabolite, the auc increased by 77% while c
 max decreased by 19%. strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of cyp2c8 are to be avoided or used with caution during 
 enzalutamide treatment. if patients must be co-administered a strong cyp2c8 inhibitor, the dose of 
 enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2).</p><p>cyp3a4 inhibitors and inducers cyp3a4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. following oral administration of the strong cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the auc of 
 enzalutamide increased by 41% while c
 max was unchanged. for the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc increased by 27% while c
 max was again unchanged. no dose adjustment is necessary when xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of cyp3a4.</p><p>
 potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products</p><p>enzyme induction enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of 
 enzymes or transporters is expected. the reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and 
 lead to lost or reduced clinical effect. there is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. 
 enzymes that may be induced include cyp3a in the liver and gut, cyp2b6, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and 
 uridine 5&apos;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugts - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). the 
 transport protein p-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug 
 5 resistance-associated protein 2 (mrp2), breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1).</p><p> in vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4 and a moderate inducer 
 of cyp2c9 and cyp2c19. co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral 
 doses of sensitive cyp substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the auc 
 of midazolam (cyp3a4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the auc of s-warfarin (cyp2c9 substrate), 
 and a 70% decrease in the auc of omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate). ugt1a1 may have been 
 induced as well. in a clinical study in patients with metastatic crpc, xtandi (160 mg once daily) had 
 no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel 
 (75 mg/m
 2 by infusion every 3 weeks). the auc of docetaxel decreased by 12% [geometric mean ratio (gmr) = 0.882 (90% ci: 0.767, 1.02)] while c
 max decreased by 4% [gmr = 0.963 (90% ci: 0.834, 1.11)].</p><p>
 interactions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport 
 are expected. if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are 
 not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal 
 products are to be avoided or used with caution. the risk for liver injury after paracetamol 
 administration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers.</p><p>
 groups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to:</p><p>
 • analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) • antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) • anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) • anticoagulants (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin) • antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) • antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) • betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol) • calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) • cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) • corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) • hiv antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) • hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) • statins metabolized by cyp3a4 (e.g. atorvastatine, simvastatin) • thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine)</p><p>
 the full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start 
 of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some 
 induction effects may be apparent earlier. patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of 
 cyp2b6, cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, or ugt1a1 should be evaluated for possible loss of 
 pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during 
 the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. in 
 consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may 
 persist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. a gradual dose reduction of the 
 concomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>
 cyp2c8 substrates enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the auc or cmax of pioglitazone (cyp2c8 substrate). the auc of pioglitazone increased by 20% while c
 max decreased by 18%. no dose adjustment is indicated when a cyp2c8 substrate is co-administered with xtandi.</p><p>p-gp substrates</p><p>in vitro</p><p>data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-gp. the effect of enzalutamide on p-gp substrates has not been evaluated 
 in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer of p-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor 
 6 (pxr). medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for p-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
 xtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.</p><p>bcrp, mrp2, oat3 and oct1 substrates</p><p>based on in vitro data, inhibition of bcrp and mrp2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. 
 theoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.</p><p>
 effect of food on enzalutamide exposures 
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. in clinical trials, 
 xtandi was administered without regard to food.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential there are no human data on the use of xtandi in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use in

 contraception in males and females 
 it is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. a condom is required 
 during and for 3 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity 
 with a pregnant woman. if the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing 
 potential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after 
 treatment. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).</p><p>

 description of selected adverse reactions</p><p>
 seizure in the phase 3 clinical studies, 7 patients (0.4%) experienced a seizure out of 1671 patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas one patient (&lt;0.1%) receiving placebo experienced a 
 seizure. dose appears to be an important predictor of the risk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical 
 data, and data from a dose-escalation study. in both phase 3 studies, patients with prior seizure or risk 
 factors for seizure were excluded.</p><p>
 in the affirm trial, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 post-chemotherapy patients 
 treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas no seizures occurred in patients receiving 
 placebo. potentially contributing factors were present in several of these patients that may have 
 independently increased their risk of seizure. in the prevail trial, one patient (0.1%) out of 
 871 chemotherapy-naive patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, and one patient 
 (0.1%) receiving placebo experienced a seizure.</p><p>the mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure threshold is not known, but could be

 mechanism of action 
 prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor 
 signalling. despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling 
 continues to promote disease progression. stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor 
 requires nuclear localization and dna binding. enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling 
 inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. enzalutamide 
 competitively inhibits binding of androgens to androgen receptors, inhibits nuclear translocation of 
 activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with dna even in 
 the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens. 
 enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death 
 and tumour regression. in preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 in a phase 3 clinical trial of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of patients 
 treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% decline 
 from baseline in psa levels.</p><p> 
 clinical efficacy and safety 
 efficacy of enzalutamide was established in two randomized placebo-controlled multicentre phase 3 
 clinical studies [crpc2 (affirm), mdv3100-03 (prevail)] of patients with progressive 
 metastatic prostate cancer who had failed androgen deprivation therapy [luteinising hormone-releasing 
 hormone (lhrh) analogue or after bilateral orchiectomy]. the prevail study enrolled 
 chemotherapy-naive patients; whereas the affirm study enrolled patients who had received prior 
 docetaxel. all patients continued on a lhrh analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. in the active 
 treatment arm, xtandi was administered orally at a dose of 160 mg daily. in both clinical trials, 
 patients received placebo in the control arm and patients were allowed, but not required, to take 
 prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent).</p><p>
 changes in psa serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. therefore, 
 in both studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until 
 discontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study.</p></section><section><header>mdv3100-03 (prevail) study (chemotherapy-naive patients)</header><p>a total of 1717 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (n = 872) or placebo orally 
 once daily (n = 845). patients with visceral disease, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart 
 failure (nyha class 1 or 2), and patients taking medications associated with lowering the seizure 
 threshold were allowed. patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might 
 predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. 
 study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-
 related event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of either a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an 
 investigational agent, or until unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>
 9 patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. the median age was 71 years (range 42-93) and the racial distribution was 77% caucasian, 10% 
 asian, 2% black and 11% other or unknown races. sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients had an 
 ecog performance status score of 0 and 32% patients had ecog performance status 1. baseline pain 
 assessment was 0-1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients and 2-3 (mildly symptomatic) in 32% of 
 patients as defined by the brief pain inventory short form (worst pain over past 24 hours on a scale of 
 0 to 10). approximately 45% of patients had measurable soft tissue disease at study entry, and 12% of 
 patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases.</p><p>
 co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival 
 (rpfs). in addition to the co-primary endpoints, benefit was also assessed using time to initiation of 
 cytotoxic chemotherapy, best overall soft tissue response, time to first skeletal-related event, psa 
 response (≥50% decrease from baseline), time to psa progression, and time to fact-p total score 
 degradation.</p><p>
 radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies as defined by 
 prostate cancer clinical trials working group 2 (pcwg2) criteria (for bone lesions) and/or response 
 evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist v 1.1) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). analysis of rpfs 
 utilized centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.</p><p>
 at the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival, treatment with enzalutamide demonstrated a 
 statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to treatment with placebo with a 
 29.4% reduction in risk of death [hr=0.706, (95% ci: 0.596; 0.837), p &lt; 0.0001]. at the interim 
 analysis, 27.6% (241 of 872) of patients treated with enzalutamide, compared with 35.4% (299 of 845) 
 of patients treated with placebo, had died. estimated median overall survival was 32.4 months (95% 
 ci: 30.1, not reached) in the enzalutamide-treated patients and was 30.2 months (95% ci: 28.0, not 
 reached) in the placebo-treated patients (table 2). in addition, 40% of enzalutamide-treated patients 
 and 70% of placebo-treated patients received subsequent therapies with a demonstrated survival 
 benefit.</p><p>
 the results of an exploratory updated overall survival analysis performed before patient crossover to 
 open-label enzalutamide treatment, which included an additional 116 events, were consistent with the 
 interim analysis (table 2 and figure 1).</p></section><section><header>table 2: overall survival of patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo in the

 surgery to bone for prostate cancer, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of 
 antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis included 587 skeletal-related events, of which 
 389 events (66.3%) were radiation to bone, 79 events (13.5%) were spinal cord compression, 
 12 70 events (11.9%) were pathologic bone fracture, 45 events (7.6%) were change in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, and 22 events (3.7%) were surgery to bone.</p><p>
 patients receiving enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total psa response rate (defined 
 as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% 
 (difference = 74.5%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 the median time to psa progression per pcwg2 criteria was 11.2 months for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 2.8 months for patients who received placebo [hr=0.169, (95% ci: 0.147, 0.195), 
 p&lt;0.0001].</p><p>
 treatment with enzalutamide decreased the risk of fact-p degradation by 37.5% compared with 
 placebo (p&lt;0.001). the median time to degradation in fact-p was 11.3 months in the enzalutamide 
 group and 5.6 months in the placebo group.</p></section><section><header>crpc2 (affirm) study (patients who previously received chemotherapy)</header><p>the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received docetaxel and were using a lhrh analogue or had undergone orchiectomy were 
 assessed in a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 clinical trial. a total of 
 1199 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once 
 daily (n = 800) or placebo once daily (n = 399). patients were allowed but not required to take 
 prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). patients randomised 
 to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression (defined as confirmed radiographic 
 progression or the occurrence of a skeletal-related event) and initiation of new systemic antineoplastic 
 treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.</p><p>
 the following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the 
 treatment arms. the median age was 69 years (range 41-92) and the racial distribution was 93% 
 caucasian, 4% black, 1% asian, and 2% other. the ecog performance score was 0-1 in 91.5% of 
 patients and 2 in 8.5% of patients; 28% had a mean brief pain inventory score of ≥4 (mean of 
 patient’s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours calculated for seven days prior to 
 randomization). most (91%) patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral lung and/or liver 
 involvement. at study entry, 41% of randomized patients had psa progression only, whereas 59% of 
 patients had radiographic progression. fifty-one percent (51%) of patients were on bisphosphonates at 
 baseline.</p><p>
 the affirm study excluded patients with medical conditions that may predispose them to seizures 
 (see section 4.8) and medicinal products known to decrease the seizure threshold, as well as clinically 
 significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent history of myocardial 
 infarction or unstable angina, new york heart association class iii or iv heart failure (unless ejection 
 fraction was ≥ 45%), clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or av block (without permanent 
 pacemaker).</p><p>

 in addition to the observed improvement in overall survival, key secondary endpoints (psa 
 progression, radiographic progression-free survival, and time to first skeletal-related event) favoured 
 enzalutamide and were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing.</p><p> 
 radiographic progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator using recist v 1.1 for soft 
 tissue and appearance of 2 or more bone lesions in bone scan was 8.3 months for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 2.9 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.404, 95% ci: [0.350, 0.466]; 
 p &lt; 0.0001). the analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented 
 progression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to 
 bone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions.</p><p>
 confirmed psa decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with 
 enzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p &lt; 0.0001). the 
 median time to psa progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 
 3.0 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.248, 95% ci: [0.204, 0.303]; p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 the median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide 
 and 13.3 months for patients who received placebo (hr = 0.688, 95% ci: [0.566, 0.835]; p &lt; 0.0001). 
 a skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, 
 spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. the analysis involved 
 448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were 
 spinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change 
 in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone.</p><p>
 the efficacy of enzalutamide in patients who have previously received abiraterone acetate has not 
 been studied.</p><p>
 older people 
 of the 1671 patients in the phase 3 trials who received enzalutamide, 1261 patients (75%) were 
 65 years and over and 516 patients (31%) were 75 years and over. no overall differences in safety or 
 effectiveness were observed between these older patients and younger patients.</p><p>
 15 paediatric population the european medicines agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
 enzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
 information on paediatric use).</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>enzalutamide is poorly water soluble. in this product, the solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. in preclinical studies, the absorption of 
 enzalutamide was increased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy 
 male subjects. the mean terminal half-life (t
 1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. with daily 
 oral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. daily 
 fluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). clearance of 
 enzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as 
 active as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as 
 enzalutamide.</p><p>
 absorption 
 maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) of enzalutamide in patients are observed 1 to 2 hours after administration. based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated 
 to be at least 84.2%. enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters p-gp or bcrp. at 
 steady state, the mean c
 max values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 μg/ml (23% coefficient of variation [cv]) and 12.7 μg/ml (30 %cv), respectively.</p><p>
 food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. in clinical trials, xtandi was 
 administered without regard to food.</p><p>
 distribution 
 the mean apparent volume of distribution (v/f) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 
 110 l (29% cv). the volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body 
 water, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide 
 and its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. the active metabolite is 
 95% bound to plasma proteins. there was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and 
 other highly bound drugs (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) 
 in vitro.</p><p>
 biotransformation</p><p>
 enzalutamide is extensively metabolized. there are two major metabolites in human plasma: 
 n-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). enzalutamide is 
 metabolized by cyp2c8 and to a lesser extent by cyp3a4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a 
 role in the formation of the active metabolite. 
 in vitro, n-desmethyl enzalutamide is metabolized to the carboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the metabolism of 
 enzalutamide to the carboxylic acid metabolite.</p><p>n-desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolized by 
 cyps 
 in vitro.</p><p> 
 under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of cyp3a4, a moderate inducer of 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19, and has no clinically relevant effect on cyp2c8 (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 elimination 
 the mean apparent clearance (cl/f) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 l/h.</p><p>
 following oral administration of 
 14c-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of 
 16 enzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as unchanged enzalutamide).</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for oatp1b1, oatp1b3, or oct1; and n-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate for p-gp or bcrp.</p><p>
 in vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oct2, or oat1.</p><p>
 linearity 
 no major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. the 
 steady-state c
 min values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained constant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics 
 once steady-state is achieved.</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 no formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. patients with serum 
 creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) were excluded from clinical trials. based on a population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine 
 clearance (crcl) values ≥ 30 ml/min (estimated by the cockcroft and gault formula). enzalutamide 
 has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (crcl &lt; 30 ml/min) or end-stage 
 renal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. it is unlikely that enzalutamide will 
 be significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (n = 6) or 
 moderate (n = 8) hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b, respectively) and in 14 matched 
 control subjects with normal hepatic function. following a single oral 160 mg dose of enzalutamide, 
 the auc and c
 max for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% and 24%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. for the sum of 
 unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the auc and c
 max in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, and the auc and c
 max in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, compared to healthy control 
 subjects. the patients in the moderate hepatic impairment group however had only modest impairment 
 in parameters indicative of metabolic function (albumin, prothrombin time), and thus a larger effect in 
 other patients with moderate hepatic impairment cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh c) were excluded from clinical trials.</p><p>
 race 
 most patients in the clinical trials (&gt; 84%) were caucasian. based on pharmacokinetic data from a 
 study in japanese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant differences in 
 exposure between japanese and caucasians. there are insufficient data to evaluate potential 
 differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races.</p><p>
 older people 
 no clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>enzalutamide treatment of pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths and external and skeletal changes. reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with 
 enzalutamide, but in studies in rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 39 weeks), atrophy, 
 aspermia/hypospermia, and hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the reproductive system were noted, consistent 
 with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide. in studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) 
 17 and dogs (4, 13, and 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases in organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymis. leydig cell hypertrophy and/or 
 hyperplasia were observed in mice (4 weeks) and dogs (39 weeks). additional changes to reproductive 
 tissues included hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats 
 and testicular hypospermia and seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. gender differences were 
 noted in rat mammary glands (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). changes in the 
 reproductive organs in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide 
 and reversed or partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. there were no other important 
 changes in clinical pathology or histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either 
 species.</p><p>
 enzalutamide did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (ames) assay and was not 
 clastogenic in either the 
 in vitro cytogenetic assay with mouse lymphoma cells or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of enzalutamide 
 have not been conducted. enzalutamide was not phototoxic 
 in vitro.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>capsule contents caprylocaproyl macrogol-8 glycerides</p><p>
