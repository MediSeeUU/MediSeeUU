 problem statement 
 disease or condition</header><p>this application is to extend the indication of xtandi (enzalutamide) to include the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in combination with androgen deprivation 
 therapy. hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is defined as the absence of evidence of castration 
 resistance, defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite castrate levels of testosterone while on</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue (lhrha), or following bilateral orchiectomy (j clin oncol. 2008;26:1148–59).</p></section><section><header>epidemiology</header><p>worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men (bray et al, 2018). in europe, the estimated number of new prostate cancer cases was approximately 473,344 in 
 2020 and the number of deaths was approximately 108,088 in 2020 (globocan, 2020).</p></section><section><header>clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>prostate cancer may present as localised disease, locally advanced disease or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. despite intense use of prostate-specific antigen (psa) for screening and early detection of 
 prostate cancer, 2% to 43% of patients initially present with metastatic disease (cancer research uk, 
 2019; siegel et al, 2019; schröder et al, 2012; tombal, 2012). 
 staging of prostate cancer is done using the clinical tumour node metastasis (tnm) classification, the 
 gleason score and/or current</p><p>international society of urological pathology (isup) grading system (n 
 mottet, 2018 guidelines for staging of prostate cancer). 
 the prognosis of men with prostate cancer drops considerably upon the development of metastases (5-
 year os rate of 30%) (noone et al, 2018; james et al, 2016). moreover, death of patients with 
 metastatic crpc typically occurs within 24 to 48 months after the onset of metastatic castration 
 resistance and is commonly preceded by a sequence of landmark events associated with deterioration of 
 overall health and worsening symptoms including pain and cachexia (beer et al, 2017; devlin et al, 2017; 
 basch et al, 2013; logothetis et al, 2012). prognostic factors that influence survival in metastatic 
 castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mcspc) include high prostate specific antigen (psa) concentration 
 at diagnosis, high gleason score, higher primary tumour stage, worse world health organization (who) 
 performance status, younger age, and the presence of bone metastases.</p></section><section><header>management</header><p>localised disease may be amenable to curative primary intervention such as surgery or radiation therapy, however, a significant proportion of patients have a recurrence of disease and require systemic 
 treatment. early in the disease, prostate cancer is dependent on androgen for growth and survival. 
 therefore, depriving prostate cancer cells of androgen is a primary form of therapy. such prostate 
 cancers are referred to as androgen-dependent or hormone-sensitive and treatments that decrease 
 androgen levels or block androgen activity can inhibit their growth.</p><p>
 patients with recurrent disease after primary treatment, or those who present with more advanced or 
 metastatic disease, are usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy (adt). initially, most patients 
 are sensitive to androgen deprivation (castration), but eventually there is a progression from hormone-
 sensitive prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc), where crpc is defined as 
 disease progression in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl). 
 as metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is dependent on androgen for growth and survival, 
 depriving prostate cancer cells of androgen is a primary form of therapy for mhspc patients. adt has 
 been the basis for the treatment of patients with mhspc, and results in a median overall survival of 3-4 
 years. adt is defined as surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 9/100 
 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) agonists or antagonists (eau, esmo, nccn 2018, fizazi 2017). the aim of these approaches is to reduce testosterone concentrations. although the majority of mhspc 
 patients have an initial response to treatment with adt, most men progress to castration-resistant 
 prostate cancer within a median of approximately 1 year. 
 treatment options for men with mhspc have expanded beyond adt alone. two studies (stampede arm 
 c and chaarted) provide evidence that combining a short course of docetaxel chemotherapy with adt 
 in mcspc resulted in prolonged survival compared with treatment with adt alone. docetaxel is currently 
 approved in combination with adt, with or without prednisone or prednisolone, for the treatment of 
 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (see epar docetaxel). additionally, the 
 stampede arm g and latitude studies showed that abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone 
 (aap) added to adt was effective in prolonging overall survival (os) compared with adt alone. 
 abiraterone acetate is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
 high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in adult men in combination with 
 androgen deprivation therapy (adt) (see epar zytiga). both adt plus docetaxel and adt plus 
 abiraterone/prednisone are recommended by esmo guideline as first-line treatment of metastatic, 
 hormone-naïve disease (esmo 2015; esmo eupdate 2019). 
 furthermore, apalutamide has also recently been approved in adult men for the treatment of metastatic 
 hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (adt) 
 (see epar erleada).</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 about the product</header><p>enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. enzalutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, 
 and consequently; inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the 
 activated androgen receptor with dna even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in 
 prostate cancer cells resistant to anti androgens. enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of 
 prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression. in preclinical studies 
 enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity (see smpc section 5.1). 
 enzalutamide was approved in the eu in june 2013. enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment 
 of adult men with metastatic crpc who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen 
 deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated and for those whose disease has 
 progressed on or after docetaxel therapy. enzalutamide is also authorised for the treatment of adult men 
 with high-risk non-metastatic crpc (see smpc 4.1). 
 the mah applied for an extension of indication for xtandi as follows: “xtandi is indicated for the treatment 
 of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in combination with androgen 
 deprivation therapy (see section 5.1).” 
 the recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg soft capsules) as a single oral daily dose.</p><p>
 medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) analogue should be continued 
 during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. 
 additionally, the mah provided the updated 5-year overall survival results obtained from the prevail 
 study (mdv3100-03) in chemo-naïve mcrpc for inclusion in the smpc.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 carcinogenicity</header><p>the mah had previously submitted the report for the 26-week definitive carcinogenicity study in the tg rash2 mouse (emea/h/c/002639/ii/0039/g). the current submission completes the carcinogenicity 
 evaluation of enzalutamide by providing data in both sexes from a preliminary 13-week dose-range finding 
 (drf) study in wistar hannover (wh)rats and a definitive 104-week carcinogenicity study in wh rats.</p></section><section><header>13-week drf study [9785-tx-0016]:</header><p>wistar hannover rats (12/gender/group, 6 weeks of age at the start of treatment) were treated with enzalutamide for 13 weeks (once a day), at dose levels of 0 (water for injection), 0 (vehicle, labrasol), 
 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day. clinical observation, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, 
 urinalysis, haematology, clinical chemistry, organ weight, necropsy and histopathological examination 
 were conducted. in addition, systemic exposure was evaluated by determining plasma concentrations of 
 enzalutamide and its metabolites on day 1 (first administration), in week 4 and in week 13 of 
 administration in the satellite animals.</p><p>
 enzalutamide was well tolerated in rats for 13 weeks at dose levels up to 200 mg/kg/day. enzalutamide-
 related findings in males included increases in absolute and relative weights of the testes, and decreases</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 11/100 
 in absolute and relative weights of the prostate, epididymides and seminal vesicles; associated decreases in the sizes of the prostate and seminal vesicles, as well as microscopic findings of diffuse leydig cell 
 hyperplasia in the testes and minimal atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles (≥ 50 mg/kg/day). 
 necropsy revealed calculi in the urinary bladder in males. in the kidney, enzalutamide-related findings 
 included increases in kidney weight (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, males; ≥50 mg/kg/day, females) and microscopic 
 findings of pelvic crystals (200 mg/kg/day, male), dilatation of the distal tubules and collecting ducts (≥ 
 50 mg/kg/day, males), regeneration of collecting duct in papilla (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, both sexes), and 
 urothelial hyperplasia (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, both sexes). 
 these findings were associated with increases in plasma creatinine (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, males) and blood 
 urea nitrogen (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, males). in the urinary bladder, there were crystals (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, 
 males) and urothelial hyperplasia (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, males). urinalysis indicated unidentified needle-like 
 crystals in the urinary sediments (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, both sexes). 
 based on the saturation of absorption, lack of exposure increase and generally similar findings between 
 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in the 13-week dose range finding study, 100 mg/kg/day was selected as the 
 highest dose for the 2-year carcinogenicity study. the low (10 mg/kg/day) and mid (30 mg/kg/day) 
 doses were selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose responses.</p></section><section><header>104-week (104-week) carcinogenicity study [9785-tx-0017]:</header><p>a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats was conducted with wistar han (both sexes). in this study dose levels: 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg were given per day. survival rates in the control ii (labrasol vehicle) 
 group were 51.4% in males and 55.7% in females. survival rates in the 100 mg/kg/day (high dose) dose 
 group were slightly lower in males (38.6%) compared to concurrent male controls and to the female high 
 dose group (40.0%). the mortality in males at 100 mg/kg/day was largely attributed to urinary bladder 
 tumours, which were occasionally accompanied by reddish urine and additional non-neoplastic renal and 
 urogenital tract findings, without palpable masses. 
 daily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide at 10–100 mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence 
 of neoplastic findings (compared to control).</p><p>enzalutamide-related neoplastic findings can be divided into 1) tumours that were potentially related to 
 the primary pharmacology and 2) tumours in males that were likely secondary to the continuous irritation 
 caused by the urinary crystals and calculi in the rat kidney and urinary bladder. the tumours related to 
 the primary pharmacology included benign thymoma of the thymus, fibroadenoma of the mammary 
 glands, and benign leydig cell tumours of the testes in males; benign granulosa cell tumours of the 
 ovaries in females; and adenoma of the pituitary pars distalis in both sexes. the tumours that were 
 considered secondary to irritation caused by crystals/calculi included urothelial papilloma/carcinoma of 
 the urinary bladder in males. the dose-specific animal to human exposure margins for each sex in the 
 carcinogenicity study are summarized in</p><p>

 discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>no additional nonclinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. this is acceptable since the nonclinical data available from previous submissions are considered sufficient to support the 
 newly claimed indication. 
 with regards to carcinogenicity, the daily oral administration of enzalutamide for 26 weeks did not 
 demonstrate any neoplastic findings, indicative of a lack of carcinogenic potential in the tg rash2 mice at 
 a dose of ≤ 20 mg/kg per day. however, taking into account that the plasma exposure levels at 
 20 mg/kg/day (348 µg.h/ml and 286 µg.h/ml, in females and males respectively) were similar to the 
 clinical exposure in metastatic crpc patients receiving 160 mg/kg/day (322 µg.h/ml) and, the auc24h 
 for m1 and m2 ranged from 0.08 to 0.21-fold of those in humans, the carcinogenicity potential of 
 enzalutamide cannot be discarded.</p><p>
 in the 13-week drf study in wistar han (wh) rats, enzalutamide was found to be well-tolerated. based 
 on the saturation of absorption, as evidenced by a lack of a dose-dependent exposure increase and 
 generally similar findings at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, the 100 mg/kg/day was selected as the high dose 
 for the 104-week carcinogenicity study, with the low (10 mg/kg/day) and mid (30 mg/kg/day) dose levels 
 selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose responses.</p><p>
 a 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats wistar han (both sexes) has been completed in line with ich s1a 
 guideline. in this study (dose levels: 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day), the increased incidences of the 
 following tumours were considered treatment-related in male wistar han (wh) rats: leydig cell tumour in 
 the testis (≥10 mg/kg per day); benign thymoma in the thymus (≥10 mg/kg per day); and urothelial 
 papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder, adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and fibroadenoma in 
 the mammary gland (100 mg/kg per day). 
 in female wh rats, treatment-related increases in adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary (≥ 30 mg/kg 
 per day) and benign granulosa cell tumour in the ovary (100 mg/kg per day) were noted.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 14/100 
 except for the urinary bladder, these tumours were observed in organs that are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis and may be related to the pharmacological activity of 
 enzalutamide. leydig cell tumours in rats are generally accepted as not relevant to humans [cook et al, 
 1999].</p><p>the human relevance of thymoma, pituitary adenoma, granulosa cell tumour in the ovary and 
 mammary fibroadenoma in rats cannot be ruled out. 
 urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder could be induced by continuous local irritation of 
 the epithelium by crystals or calculi that consist of excreted carboxylic acid metabolite. calculi and 
 crystals were observed in rat urinary bladders. however, no obvious mechanistic rationale to explain 
 specifically this malignancy can be established. at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day, the exposure multiples 
 of enzalutamide in male rats were 0.28-, 0.76- and 1.4-fold, respectively, of the exposure in humans 
 taking enzalutamide 160 mg/day, while those of the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite were 0.17-, 0.44- 
 and 1.7-fold, respectively. at all dose levels, the exposure multiple of the active metabolite, n-desmethyl 
 enzalutamide, in male rats was less than 0.12-fold. in conclusion, taking into account that exposure 
 levels, based on auc, achieved in the study, for enzalutamide plus its metabolite m2, were less than or 
 similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg/day (322 µg.h/ml), 
 urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in human cannot be excluded .</p><p>results of 
 prosper clinical trial, assessed as part of the procedure emea/h/c/002639/ii/0049, support that the 
 clinical relevance of these types of tumours observed in rats cannot be ruled out. the results of the 
 carcinogenicity study have been reflected in section 5.3 of the smpc as part of variation 
 emea/h/c/002639/ii/0049. 
 the mah has submitted an updated era to consider the potential impact of the increased patient 
 population from the new indication on the environmental risk assessment of enzalutamide. furthermore, 
 in the original era, the degradation half-lives in aquatic sediment systems were reported at 20°c. the 
 current guidance is to report half-lives at 12°c which more accurately reflects the temperature of 
 european surface waters. this amendment quotes the degradation half-lives at 12°c and considers the 
 environmental impact of these extrapolated half-lives. based on the assessment of the updated era, 
 enzalutamide is unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environments.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.6">2.2.6.

 until the radiographic disease progression was documented, the patient started another investigational 
 agent or new therapy for treatment of prostate cancer, unacceptable toxicity or any other discontinuation 
 criteria were met. all subjects were required to maintain adt during study treatment, either using an 
 lhrh agonist/antagonist or having a history of bilateral orchiectomy.

 plus adt as assessed by radiographic progression-free survival (rpfs) based on independent central 
 review (icr). 
 secondary objectives 
 key secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the benefit of enzalutamide plus adt compared 
 with placebo plus adt as measured by overall survival (os), time to psa progression, time to start of 
 new antineoplastic therapy, psa undetectable (&lt; 0.2 ng/ml) rate, overall response rate (orr) and time 
 to deterioration of urinary symptoms.</p><p>
 additional secondary objectives were to compare time to first symptomatic skeletal event (sse); time to 
 castration resistance; quality of life (qol) as measured by quality of life questionnaire-prostate 25 
 (qlq-pr25), functional assessment of cancer therapy – prostate (fact-p) and euroqol group 5-
 dimension 5-level (eq-5d-5l), and in particular the time to deterioration in qol using the fact-p global 
 score; worsening of pain assessed by brief pain inventory-short form (bpi-sf); and to evaluate safety of 
 enzalutamide plus adt as compared to placebo plus adt. 
 exploratory objective (north america sites only) 
 the study also included an exploratory objective to determine gene mutations potentially related to 
 resistance of enzalutamide plus adt as assessed by dna mutation testing (i.e., sequence analysis of</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 circulating free tumour dna) in plasma. this objective was limited to patients who signed a separate genotyping informed consent form at north american sites.</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>primary endpoint the primary endpoint was rpfs (based on central review), where rpfs events were defined as objective 
 evidence of radiographic progression disease (rpd) as assessed by icr or death, as follows:</p><p>
 - death from any cause within 24 weeks (2 scan cycles) from study drug discontinuation.</p><p>- rpd was defined by recist 1.1 for soft tissue disease or the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scan. unconfirmed disease progression on a bone scan at week 13 was not to be 
 considered an event. the study-specified documentation and confirmation required for the 
 determination of rpd are listed in table 4. the date of rpd was the date the first objective 
 evidence of rpd was documented rpfs (based on central review). 
 table 4 study-specified documentation for radiographic evidence of disease progression vs pcwg2 criteria</p><p> in patients with an rpfs event, rpfs was to be calculated as the time from the date of randomisation to the first objective evidence of rpd at any time or death up to 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation 
 without documented radiographic progression, whichever occurred first. in patients with no rpfs event, 
 rpfs was to be censored on the date of last evaluable radiographic assessment prior to the data analysis 
 cut-off date. in patients with no baseline radiographic assessment, with no postbaseline radiographic 
 assessments or with all postbaseline radiographic assessments documented as “not evaluable (ne),” the 
 rpfs was to be censored on the date of randomisation. 
 key secondary endpoints 
 • overall survival (os)</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 21/100 
 os was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. all events of death were included. for patients who were alive at the time of the data cut-off date, os time was to be censored 
 on the last date the patient was known to be alive or the cut-off date, whichever occurred first. 
 • time to psa progression time to psa progression was calculated as the time from randomisation to the date of first 
 observation of psa progression. a psa progression was defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute 
 increase of ≥ 2 ng/ml above the nadir (i.e., lowest psa value observed postbaseline or at baseline), 
 which was confirmed by a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later. only results from psa 
 samples taken before the start of any new prostate cancer therapy after the start of study drug were 
 to be considered. 
 • time to start of new antineoplastic therapy time to start of new antineoplastic therapy was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of 
 first dose administration of the first antineoplastic therapy. in patients with no new antineoplastic 
 therapy initiated for prostate cancer after randomisation, time to start of new antineoplastic therapy 
 was to be censored on the last visit date or the date of randomisation, whichever occurred last. 
 • psa undetectable rate psa undetectable rate was defined as the percentage of patients with detectable (≥0.2 ng/ml) psa at 
 baseline, which became undetectable (&lt;0.2 ng/ml) during study treatment. only results from psa 
 samples taken before the start of any new prostate cancer therapy were to be considered. 
 • overall response rate (orr) this was defined as the percentage of intent-to-treat (itt) patients with measurable disease at 
 baseline who achieved a complete response (cr) or partial response (pr) (unconfirmed responses) in 
 their soft tissue disease using the recist 1.1 criteria. in addition to orr, the best overall response 
 was also determined for each patient based on a combined response assessment. the best combined 
 (i.e., overall) response was the best response assessment, based on the recist 1.1 assessment for 
 soft tissue lesions on ct/mri and the response assessment for bone lesions on bone scans, reported 
 at any time during the study. bone lesions were assessed for cr, non-cr/non-pd and pd.</p><p>as bone 
 lesions were evaluated differently than soft tissue lesions, the possible categories changed when 
 considering bone and soft tissue responses together.</p><p>“cr” reflects patients with cr for all pre-
 existing metastases and “pd” reflects patients with pd in either soft tissue or bone. in this setting, 
 “pr” includes patients with cr or pr in soft tissue and who remained non-cr/non-pd in bone lesions 
 and those patients with pr in soft tissue-only disease. 
 • time to deterioration of urinary symptoms the deterioration of urinary symptoms was based on responses to a selected subset of symptoms 
 from the “urinary symptoms” subscale of the qlq-pr25 questionnaire (3 items: q31 to q33). 
 deterioration in urinary symptoms was defined as an increase in the urinary symptoms’ subscale 
 score by ≥ 50% of the standard deviation observed in the urinary symptoms’ subscale score at 
 baseline. the time to confirmed deterioration in urinary symptoms was defined as the time interval to 
 the first deterioration in urinary symptoms that was confirmed by a second consecutive assessment of 
 the deterioration. 
 other secondary endpoints 
 • time to castration resistance: defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration resistance event. a castration resistance event was defined as the occurrence of rpd by icr, psa 
 progression, or sse, whichever occurred first, with castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 22/100 
 • time to deterioration of quality of life (fact-p): the time to deterioration of qol was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the first date a decline from baseline of 
 10 points or more in the fact-p total score was recorded. 
 • time to first symptomatic skeletal event (sse): an sse was defined as radiation to bone, surgery to bone, a clinically apparent pathological bone fracture or a spinal cord compression. in patients 
 with an sse, the time to the first sse was defined as the time from randomisation to the 
 occurrence of the first sse prior to the data analysis cut-off date. 
 • time to pain progression: defined as time from randomization to the first pain progression event, which was an increase of ≥ 30% from baseline in the average brief pain inventory-short form 
 (bpi-sf) item scores. 
 • patient reported outcomes (pro) using fact-p, eq-5d-5l, qlq-pr25, bpi-sf.</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>approximately 1,100 patients (550 patients per treatment group) were planned to be randomised in the study. the final analysis of the primary endpoint (rpfs) was to be conducted when a minimum of 
 262 progression events had occurred, based on the following considerations:</p><p>
 1.</p><p>a target hazard ratio (hr) was 0.67. the expected median rpfs for the placebo plus adt group was 
 20 months as measured from the date of randomisation. under the assumption of an exponential 
 distribution, a target hr of 0.67 corresponds to approximately 50% increase in median rpfs for 
 the enzalutamide plus adt group relative to the placebo plus adt group (approximately 30 vs 20 
 months).</p><p>
 2.</p><p>262 rpfs events (radiographic progression at any time or death from any cause within 24 weeks after 
 study drug discontinuation, whichever occurred first) provide 90% power to detect the target hr 
 based on a 2-sided log-rank test and a significance level of 0.05. 
 in addition, the study was powered for os. specifically, 342 death events were required to provide 80% 
 power to detect a target hr of 0.73 with a target difference in kaplan-meier estimated median of 
 approximately 15 months (40 months for placebo plus adt vs 55 months for enzalutamide plus adt) at 
 the 0.04 significance level under the assumption of an exponential distribution. this significance level was 
 chosen to apply a parallel testing strategy between os and some other secondary endpoints (with 
 allocated type i error rate of 0.01).</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>randomisation was performed via the interactive response technology (irt) system and treatment assigned in a 1:1 ratio to enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo. subjects were to be stratified by prior 
 docetaxel (none, 1-5 cycles, 6 cycles) and disease volume (low versus high). high-volume disease was 
 defined as metastases involving the viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, the presence of 4 or 
 more bone lesions, at least 1 of which in a bony structure beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone. 
 prior docetaxel therapy was defined as 1 or more cycles of docetaxel but no more than 6 cycles. 
 the categories ‘1-5 cycles’ and ‘6 cycles’ used at randomisation for the stratification factor ‘prior 
 docetaxel use’ were regrouped in the stratified analyses because of the small number of randomized 
 patients with 1 to 5 cycles of docetaxel as prior medication. this stratification factor therefore became

 at the time of primary endpoint analysis and recommendation of the data safety monitoring board 
 (dsmb) on study continuation, patients were eligible to transition to an optional open-label extension 
 portion of the current study. the open-label extension period was added in substantial amendment 3 to 
 the study protocol.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>the following analysis sets were used for the analyses:</p><p>1.</p><p>the itt population, defined as all patients who were randomised in this study. the itt population 
 was analysed by treatment group as randomised (i.e., treatment group based on randomization 
 assignment) regardless of study drug administration. unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses 
 were performed on the itt population.</p><p>
 2.</p><p>the safety population, defined as all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
 the safety population was used to conduct safety analyses by treatment group as treated (i.e., 
 based on the actual study drug the patient received for the greater number of days rather than 
 the study drug to which the patient was randomised). 
 primary efficacy endpoint: rpfs 
 the effect of enzalutamide plus adt compared to placebo plus adt was tested using a stratified log-rank 
 test at the level of significance of 0.05 (2-sided). the stratification factors were prior docetaxel use (yes 
 vs no) and disease volume (low vs high); both factors were used at randomisation. the analysis was to 
 be conducted when at least 262 rpfs events had occurred.</p><p>
 kaplan-meier methods were used to estimate the distribution of rpfs events by treatment group. the 
 median rpfs was estimated using the corresponding 50
 th percentile of kaplan-meier estimates. a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (ci) was provided for this estimate by use of the brookmeyer and crowley 
 method. the benefit of enzalutamide plus adt compared to placebo plus adt was summarised by a 
 single hr with its 95% ci based on a cox regression model stratified for prior docetaxel use and disease 
 volume. 
 the following sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the rpfs results:</p><p>
 • sensitivity analysis 1: impact of study drug discontinuation as an additional event.</p><p>• sensitivity analysis 2: impact of new antineoplastic therapy and occurrence of an sse as additional events.</p><p>
 • sensitivity analysis 3: impact of all deaths (with no time limit) as events • sensitivity analysis 4: impact of rpd documented between per-protocol visits • sensitivity analysis 5: ‘missing’ data impact – last scan not documented as not evaluable • sensitivity analysis 6: ‘missing’ data impact – absence of 2 consecutive scans • sensitivity analysis 7: censoring rpd on competing risks: new antineoplastic therapy and occurrence of an sse</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 • sensitivity analysis 8: ‘missing’ data impact and censoring rpd on competing risks: new antineoplastic therapy, occurrence of an sse and study drug discontinuation in patients with m1 
 based on icr assessments 
 • sensitivity analysis 9: limited to m1 patients who were identified from the baseline assessments made by icr 
 • sensitivity analysis 10: impact of rpd documented by the investigators • sensitivity analysis 11: impact of rpd according to pcwg2 criteria [ryan et al, 2012] and documented by the investigators 
 • sensitivity analysis 12: impact of rpd according to pcwg2 criteria and documented by icr these sensitivity analyses were conducted on the itt population using the same analysis methods as 
 described for the primary analysis. 
 subgroup analyses of rpfs were performed to determine whether the treatment effect was concordant 
 among subgroups. subgroup analyses were not adjusted for the stratification factors used at 
 randomisation. subgroup assessments included the following: age (&lt;65 years vs ≥65years), geographic 
 region, eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status at baseline (0 vs 1), gleason 
 score at initial diagnosis (&lt;8 vs ≥8), disease location at baseline (bone only, soft tissue only, both bone 
 and soft tissue), baseline psa (≤ overall median vs &gt; overall median), volume of disease at baseline (low 
 vs high), prior docetaxel use (yes vs no) and prior use of adt or orchiectomy (yes vs no). 
 key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
 all secondary endpoint analyses were performed at the time of the rpfs final analysis (i.e., when at least 
 262 rpfs events had occurred).</p><p>
 the primary rpfs endpoint was tested at a 0.05 (2-sided) significance level. once testing confirmed this 
 primary endpoint was statistically significant, the 6 key secondary endpoints were tested utilizing a 
 method to preserve the family-wise 2-sided type i error rate at 0.05. a parallel testing strategy was used 
 to test os with an allocated type i error rate of 0.04 and the remaining 5 key secondary endpoints (time 
 to psa progression, time to start of a new antineoplastic therapy, rate of psa decline to &lt;0.2ng/ml, orr 
 and time to deterioration in urinary symptoms from the qlq-pr25) with an allocated type i error rate of 
 0.01.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 exact significance level for this analysis, calculated using the o’brien-fleming alpha spending function 
 [lan &amp; demets, 1983], was used to determine the stopping boundaries based on the number of events 
 observed at the interim analysis and control the overall 2-sided alpha at 0.05 or at 0.04. if the interim 
 analysis of os was not statistically significant, the final analysis of os was planned for when 
 approximately 342 deaths were observed to ensure an adequate number of events. at the time of the 
 planned final analysis of os, no additional analyses of other efficacy endpoints were to be conducted. 
 additional secondary endpoint analyses 
 time to first sse, time to castration resistance, time to deterioration of qol based on fact-p and time to 
 pain progression were to be analysed using the same analysis methods as for rpfs. all qol assessment 
 data were also summarized descriptively by study visit.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 3 substantial amendments. major changes from the substantial amendments are summarised below. 
 substantial amendment 1 (dated 02 jun 2016) included the following major changes:</p><p>1.</p><p>added 2 exclusion criteria to exclude patients who had not received bisphosphonates or denosumab 
 at a stable dose (unless diagnosed with osteoporosis) and exclude patients who had shown a 
 hypersensitivity reaction to any of the study capsule components. 
 2.</p><p>revised test drug information to remove information related to tablet formulations and add 
 information related to the capsule formulation of study drug and placebo (chemical name, 
 physical description and storage requirements). 
 substantial amendment 2 (dated 14 dec 2017) included the following major changes:</p><p>1.</p><p>revised the number of events required for the primary endpoint to reflect that primary analysis was 
 to occur when 262 rpd events were confirmed by independent central imaging review. all 
 secondary endpoints were to be evaluated at the time of primary analysis</p><p>
 2.</p><p>specified a step-wise approach for the statistical testing of the key secondary endpoints. to maintain 
 the family-wise 2-sided type i error rate at 0.05, a parallel testing strategy between os (with 
 allocated type i error rate 0.04) and the other 4 endpoints (with allocated type i error rate 0.01) 
 was developed. if the interim results of the os analysis were statistically significant, no further 
 analysis of os would be completed.</p><p>
 3.</p><p>specified that unblinding of study treatment assignment could have been performed if a patient 
 discontinued due to disease progression and in the investigator’s opinion this information was 
 necessary to determine the next course of therapy.</p><p>
 substantial amendment 3 (dated 10 dec 2018) included the following major changes:</p><p>1.</p><p>added an open-label extension period. following unblinding at the end of the double-blind period and

 table 6. number of patients enrolled by protocol version (all patients)</p><p>three country-specific non-substantial protocol amendments were implemented during the study. a non-substantial amendment was implemented on 21 apr 2016 to require a histological diagnosis of 
 adenocarcinoma of the prostate (in inclusion criterion 3) for entry into the study in france. a second non-
 substantial amendment was also implemented on 21 apr 2016 to provide a concise summary of risk-
 benefit assessment and modify the risk mitigation strategy that the sponsor would maintain throughout 
 the study to ensure safety of the subjects. a third and final non-substantial amendment was implemented 
 on 04 oct 2017 for canada and the us. an exploratory objective to assess genetic mutations related to 
 resistance of enzalutamide plus adt was added to the study protocol. gene mutations were to be 
 assessed in plasma samples requiring an additional 10ml of blood to be collected at randomization, week 
 49, and at study treatment discontinuation. this applied only to those patients who consented to 
 participate in this optional, exploratory analysis. 
 protocol deviations 
 a total of 152 (13.2%) patients, 70 (12.2%) in the enzalutamide plus adt group and 82 (14.2%) in the 
 placebo plus adt group, had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study.</p><p>
 major protocol deviations are grouped into the following 4 categories:</p><p>
 1.</p><p>pd1 entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria</p><p>
 2.</p><p>pd2 developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn</p><p>

 disease) in 12 (1.0%) patients, inclusion criterion 4 (patient had metastatic prostate cancer documented 
 by positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on ct or mri scan) in 12 (1.0%) patients and exclusion 
 criterion 11 (patient had absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500/μl, platelet count &lt;100000/μl or haemoglobin 
 &lt;10 g/dl [6.2 mmol/l] at screening) in 11 (1.0%) patients. all other inclusion/exclusion criteria

 on bone scan. unconfirmed disease progression on a bone scan at week 13 was not to be considered an 
 event. the study-specified documentation and confirmation required for the determination of rpd are 
 listed in table 4. however, the icr did not follow table 4 for bone scans and reported disease progression 
 based on bone scan according to pcwg2 criteria [scher et al, 2008] instead. the icr assessed 
 radiographic progression on bone scan solely on the appearance of bone lesion(s) which were new 
 compared to baseline of week 13.</p><p>
 treatment with enzalutamide plus adt demonstrated a statistically significant 61% reduction in the risk 
 of a patient experiencing an rpfs event compared with placebo plus adt treatment (hr=0.39 [95% ci: 
 0.30, 0.50]; p&lt;0.0001). this analysis is based upon the data provided by the icr.. 
 rpfs data were censored for a higher proportion of patients in the enzalutamide plus adt group 
 compared with the placebo plus adt group (84.49% vs 65.63%). in both treatment groups, the most 
 frequent reason for censoring rpfs data was that there was no evidence of radiographic disease 
 progression at the data cut-off date (448/485 [92.37%] for the enzalutamide plus adt group vs 348/378 
 [92.06%] for the placebo plus adt group).</p><p>

 methods patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg daily by mouth or a conventional nonsteroidal antiandrogen -nsaa (bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide) by mouth; all patients were also treated with 
 an lhrh analogue or surgical castration. patients were allowed up to 6 cycles of concomitant docetaxel 
 (75 mg/m
 2), as long as the decision to use early docetaxel was made and specified prior to randomisation and the patients received no more than 2 cycles prior to randomisation.</p><p>
 treatment was to continue until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.</p><p>
 randomisation was stratified for volume of disease (high vs low), study site, concomitant antiresorptive 
 therapy (yes vs no), comorbidities according to the adult comorbidity evaluation [ace-27] score (0 to 1 
 vs 2 to 3) and early planned use of docetaxel (yes vs no). high volume of disease was defined as 4 or 
 more bone metastases, 1 of which was outside the vertebral column and pelvis and/or visceral 
 metastases. lymph node involvement of bladder invasion did not qualify as visceral disease. 
 antiresorptive therapy referred to concomitant therapy to delay skeletal-related events when 
 commencing adt (denosumab, zoledronic acid or any other therapy at doses proven to prevent skeletal-
 related events). ace-27 score intervals of 0 to 1 vs 2 to 3 were used for the stratification. early planned 
 use of docetaxel was defined as the use of docetaxel in conjunction with initiation of adt.</p><p>

 not exceed 24 months.</p><p>
 - up to 2 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic disease were permitted prior to randomisation; continued treatment with docetaxel was allowed for a total of up to 6cycles. 
 the primary objective was to determine the effect of enzalutamide plus adt on os (defined as death 
 from any cause). secondary objectives were to determine the effects of enzalutamide plus adt on the 
 following: psa pfs (based on the first evidence of psa progression, clinical progression or death from any 
 cause), clinical pfs (based on evidence of radiographic progression using pcwg2 for bone lesions and 
 recist 1.1 for soft tissue, development of symptoms attributable to cancer progression or initiation of 
 another anticancer treatment for prostate cancer), adverse events (aes) and hrqol (utilizing european 
 organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire core-30, qlq-pr25 and 
 eq-5d-5l health questionnaires). 
 the primary analysis population for efficacy was the itt population, defined as all randomised patients. 
 the itt population was analysed by treatment group according to study treatment assigned at the time 
 of randomization. 
 the study design included a provision for up to 3 interim efficacy analyses on os at 50%, 67% and 80% 
 of the maximum number of events being sought (i.e., 470).</p><p>the interim analyses allowed for early 
 rejection of the null hypothesis according to an alpha spending function with an o’brien-fleming boundary

 discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic (pre and post chemotherapy) and non-metastatic crpc (see smpc section 4.1). enzalutamide is an androgen receptor 
 inhibitor that targets the ar signalling pathway. within this application the mah is seeking approval for 
 the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer prior to development of castration resistant 
 disease (i.e., hormone-sensitive prostate cancer) in combination with adt.</p><p>
 additionally, the mah proposes an update in section 5.1 of the smpc based on the 5-year overall survival 
 (os) results obtained from the prevail (md v310003) study, a phase 3 study of enzalutamide in 
 chemotherapy naïve patients with metastatic prostate cancer that progressed on adt.</p></section><section><header>design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>the submission of this type ii variation for the extension of indication is based on the study 9785-cl-0335 (arches), a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of enzalutamide plus adt 
 versus placebo plus adt in 1,150 patients with mhspc. additionally, os results from the first interim 
 analysis of the study enzamet, a phase 3, randomised, open-label, active-comparator study of 
 enzalutamide plus adt versus nonsteroidal antiandrogen (nsaa) plus adt led by anzup cancer trials 
 group in collaboration with the university of sydney as sponsor, have been provided as supportive 
 information.</p><p>
 focusing on the study arches, eligibility criteria allowed the inclusion of patients with metastatic 
 adenocarcinoma of the prostate (newly diagnosed or diagnosed in a previous stage), regardless of volume 
 disease. patients with an ecog performance status &gt;1 and those with known or suspected brain 
 metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease and with history of seizure or any condition that may 
 predispose to seizure were excluded from the study. patients who have received up to 6 cycles of 
 docetaxel and prior treatment with adt (either lhrh agonists or antagonists or orchiectomy with or 
 without concurrent antiandrogens), up to 3 months (6 months if patient was treated with docetaxel), and</p><p>
 patients who have received prior adt in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting (up to 39 months in 
 duration)were allowed in the trial.</p><p>moreover, 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>

 symptoms from metastatic disease were allowed. no other prior treatment for the metastatic disease was allowed.</p><p>
 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) + adt or matching placebo 
 + adt. while the use of adt alone as comparator could be acceptable in this setting, the add-on of 
 docetaxel might have been a preferable choice, as it was suggested in the chmp scientific advice 
 (ema/chmp/sawp/596561/2015). based on the stampede and chaarted trials, in which docetaxel plus 
 adt improved os in men with metastatic, hormone-naïve disease (sweeney c, 2014; james nd, 2015), 
 adt plus docetaxel with or without prednisone or prednisolone is currently authorised for the treatment of 
 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (docetaxel epar). 
 patients were stratified by prior docetaxel (none, 1-5 cycles, 5 cycles), and disease volume (low vs high). 
 radiographic pfs (rpfs), as assessed by icr, was chosen as the primary endpoint. radiographic 
 progression disease (rpd) was defined by recist 1.1 criteria for soft tissue and by the appearance of 2 
 or more new bone lesions on bone scan. the assessment of rpfs was performed at week 13 and 
 thereafter every 12 weeks. as per protocol, if progression was identified at week 13 (bone lesion), 
 confirmation was required ≥ 6 weeks after that or at week 25 visit. the latter is considered appropriate to 
 avoid false positive of progression. progression was to be confirmed if there were ≥ 2 new bone lesions 
 on bone scan compared to week 13 scan (≥ 4 new lesions compared to baseline bone scan). at week 25 
 or later no confirmatory scan was required for bone lesions and rpd on bone scans was planned to be 
 assessed by comparison to best response on treatment. however, according to the applicant the icr 
 assessed rpd on bone scan solely on the appearance of bone lesion(s) which were new compared to 
 baseline or to week 13 (i.e. according to pcwg2 criteria – scher et al, 2008). this analysis was initially 
 planned as a sensitivity analysis but not as the primary analysis. this was considered a major deviation 
 from the protocol and statistical analysis plan (sap), and matter of concern. according to the mah this 
 change in the method of analysis was due to an unintentional error which affected 66 of the 1150 
 patients included in the arches study. a gcp inspection was conducted and no findings impacting 
 negatively the data quality were identified. 
 overall, secondary endpoints are considered acceptable, although the addition of pfs2 as a secondary 
 endpoint would have been informative. it should be pointed out that “time to deterioration in urinary 
 symptoms” was added as a secondary endpoint with amendment 3 (dated 10 dec 2018), after the data 
 cut-off. nevertheless, according to the mah the inclusion of “time to deterioration in urinary symptoms” 
 as a secondary endpoint was included in the final version of the sap, dated 15 nov 2018, while data were 
 still unblinded (database lock 14 dec 2018).</p><p>
 overall, the statistical methods seem appropriate. the efficacy analyses were performed on the itt 
 population. the primary efficacy endpoint is the rpfs with a multiplicity control for the 6 key secondary 
 endpoints, including os once rpfs was demonstrated to be statistically significant. key secondary 
 endpoints, other than os, were sequentially tested at a 1% significance level.</p><p>
 a total of 152 (13.2%) patients (70 [12.2%] in the enzalutamide arm and 82 [14.2%] in the placebo 
 arm) had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study and the majority of them were related to 
 violation of inclusion criteria. overall, percentages of major protocol deviations were balanced between 
 treatment arms, apart from the violation of the</p><p>exclusion criterion 1 (patient had received any prior 
 pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer), where the proportion of 
 patients in the control arm was double compared to the enzalutamide arm (26 [4.5%] vs 12 [2.1%], 
 respectively. exclusion criterion 1 deviations more frequent in the placebo plus adt group compared to 
 the enzalutamide plus adt group were: treated with docetaxel and received &gt;6 months adt prior to day 
 1, received &gt; 3 months of adt prior to day 1,and had final administration of docetaxel &gt;2 months prior 
 to day 1. no patterns have been identified to explain the larger number of deviations in the placebo plus</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>

 adt group vs enzalutamide plus adt group. taking into account the small number of patients and the results observed, this imbalance does not appear to have a great impact on the results. 
 regarding baseline characteristics, the population was balanced between treatment arms. the median 
 age was 70 years (range: 42, 92), with nearly 30% of patients being 75 years or older. the majority of 
 patients were white (80.5%) and had a good performance status (77.5% ecog 0). the majority of 
 patients had high volume of disease (63%) and a gleason score at initial diagnosis ≥8 (66%). median 
 serum psa was 5.21 ng/ml, with some patients with a psa level of 0. the mean psa at baseline for 
 enzalutamide group was 75.37 ng/ml which may question whether the population was castration 
 sensitive. however, patients with evidence of disease progression (i.e. radiographic or psa) in the context 
 of adt were excluded from the study, thus the population included in study arches can be considered 
 castration sensitive.</p><p>
 most of the patients had distant metastasis at diagnosis (66.7%). the majority of patients received prior 
 treatment with adt (90%) and around 18% of patients received prior treatment with docetaxel. other 
 prior therapies included radiation (16.5%) and surgery (33.5%). a high number of patients received 
 subsequent antineoplastic therapy for prostate cancer in the control arm compared to the enzalutamide 
 arm (8.0% vs 23.1%), which seems reasonable taking into account the results of the primary analysis. 
 docetaxel (1.9% vs 9.0%), abiraterone (2.3% vs 4.9%) and enzalutamide (0.7% vs 4.9%) were the 
 most commonly used subsequently in the control arm. 
 the study enzamet included a total of 1,125 patients who were randomised 1:1 to treatment with 
 enzalutamide plus adt (563 patients) or nsaa plus adt (562 patients). randomisation was stratified for 
 volume of disease (high vs low), study site, concomitant antiresorptive therapy (yes vs no), comorbidities 
 according to the ace-27 score (0 to 1 vs 2 to 3) and early planned use of docetaxel (yes vs no). 
 the primary endpoint was os without multiplicity control for the secondary endpoints. three interim 
 analyses were proposed for os, once 50%, 67% and 80% of the required events were observed. an 
 alpha spending function with an o’brien-fleming boundary shape was used with a final alpha value of 
 0.042. the enzamet study design is overall considered adequate. 
 the population included in the study enzamet is not completely comparable to the population of arches 
 study. patients in the study enzamet could receive early docetaxel use (i.e. a total of 6 cycles of 
 docetaxel, of which 0-2 cycles were allowed before randomisation) while in the study arches treatment 
 with docetaxel was only allowed prior randomisation (i.e. up to 6 cycles of docetaxel therapy with final 
 treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1) (see table 29). according to the data 
 provided by the mah, 45.1% of patients in the enzalutamide arm in study enzamet had early docetaxel 
 use (i.e. use of docetaxel in conjunction with initiation of adt), of whom approximately 43% received at 
 least 1 dose of early docetaxel. moreover, 15.8% of patients received docetaxel for metastatic disease 
 prior to randomisation.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the primary analysis of study arches was performed at the data cut-off date of 14 oct 2018. this was the only planned analysis for rpfs (primary endpoint) and the first interim analysis for os (secondary 
 endpoint).</p><p>
 with 287 rpfs events (89 [15.51%] in the enzalutamide arm and 198 [34.38%] in the placebo arm), 
 based on icr assessment, the study met its primary objective with a hr of 0.39 (95% ci: 0.3, 0.5). 
 median rpfs was not reached in the enzalutamide arm and was of 19.4 months in the placebo arm. 
 according to kaplan-meier plot, the benefit of adding enzalutamide to adt treatment is observed after the 
 third month, when the curves separate and maintained separated thereafter. rpfs data is however not</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 page 70/100 
 very mature, with nearly 85% and 66% censoring in the enzalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. the main reason for censoring in both arms was no rpfs event at the data cut-off date.</p><p>
 as previously mentioned, results of the primary analysis were based on irc assessment as per pcwg2 
 criteria (against of what was specified in the protocol). a reanalysis of rpfs as per protocol was also 
 provided. results of this analysis were in line with the primary analysis (hr 0.39 [95% ci: 0.30, 0.50]), 
 with 91 events (15.85%) in the enzalutamide plus adt group and 201 (34.9%) in the placebo plus adt 
 group. median pfs was not reached in the enzalutamide arm and was 19.0 months [95% ci: 16.59, 
 22.24]. 
 subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint showed consistent results in all subgroup analysed, including 
 the subgroup of patients previously treated with docetaxel. the mah was requested to provide rpfs data 
 for both newly diagnosed patients (i.e. patients whose initial diagnosis of prostate cancer was within 3 
 months of the first dose of randomized treatment) and recurrent disease patients (i.e. patients with prior 
 local treatment) (data not shown). overall, rpfs results in both subgroups were consistent with that of 
 the overall population.</p><p>
 moreover, several sensitivity analyses of rpfs were performed and all of them supported the primary 
 analysis. the sensitivity analysis analysing rpfs based on investigator´s assessment, in principle 
 according to the protocol-specified criteria, showed a hr of 0.46 [95% ci: 0.36, 0.59]), with a 
 concordance rate between the icr and the investigator of around 90%.</p><p>
 os was a secondary endpoint in study arches. os was assessed based on an allocated 2-sided alpha of 
 0.04. for the first interim analysis the stopping boundary was 0.0000054. at the time of the data cut-off 
 date, the number of deaths was 84 (39 [6.8%] in the enzalutamide arm and 45 [7.8%] in the placebo 
 arm). considering the immaturity of data, median os was not reached in any arm and while a 
 detrimental effect on os is excluded, the statistical significance was not reached (hr 0.81 [95% ci: 0.53, 
 1.25]; p=0.3361). therefore, the mah is recommended to provide updated os data when available. final 
 os results are expected by march 2022 (rec).</p><p> 
 other main secondary endpoints were: time to psa progression, time to start of a new antineoplastic 
 therapy, psa undetectable rate, orr and time to deterioration in urinary symptoms. the prespecified 
 level of significance for these key secondary endpoints was 0.01. overall, all these secondary endpoints 
 favoured the enzalutamide arm, with statistically significant results, except for the time to deterioration in 
 urinary symptoms (hr 0.88 [95% ci: 0.72, 1.08]; p=0.2162) where no statistically significant 
 differences were observed between treatment arms.</p><p>
 in addition, time to symptomatic skeletal event, time to castration resistance, quality of life and time to 
 pain progression (assessed by bpi-sf) were also assessed as secondary endpoints, although the “p” 
 values provided were only for descriptive purposes and should not be used to assess statistical 
 significance. adding enzalutamide to adt treatment appears to delay time to castration resistance and 
 time to first symptomatic skeletal event. however, there seems to be no differences in terms of time to 
 deterioration of qol or time to progression between treatments arms. 
 the enzamet study has been provided to support the results of the arches study. within this 
 application the mah is providing results of the first os interim analysis. no additional efficacy data have 
 been submitted. 
 this first interim analysis for os was conducted when 245 events had occurred (52% of 470 planned 
 events for the final analysis). os analysis was statistically significant, since the pre-specified alpha 
 boundary of 0.003 was crossed (hr 0.669 [95% ci: 0.518, 0.862]; p=0.0018; unstratified analysis).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 71/100 
 however, these data are considered immature (82% and 75% of censures in the experimental and control arm, respectively) and median os had not been reached in either treatment arm. at the time of 
 the data cut-off, the median follow-up time was 14.4 months in arches vs. 33.8 months in enzamet. 
 with regard to subgroup analysis, an apparently lack of benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients 
 receiving early treatment with docetaxel (hr 0.9 [95% ci: 0.615, 1.315]), especially in those patients 
 with high volume of disease (hr 0.967 [95% ci: 0.638, 1.464]). moreover, a similar pattern is observed 
 in the subgroup of patients with visceral disease (hr 1.048 [95% ci: 0.542, 2.028]), concomitant use of 
 anti-resorptive therapy (hr 1.767 [95% ci: 0.837, 3.890]) and the subgroup of european patients (hr 
 1.041 [95% ci: 0.572, 1.891]). however, data are limited due to the low number of events. 
 in the subgroup of patients not receiving early treatment with docetaxel, which may be more similar to 
 the population of study arches, the results were in line with the primary analysis (hr 0.528 [95% ci: 
 0,370, 0,743]). 
 despite the inherent limitations of subgroup analyses, it is considered that the data from the subgroup of 
 patients without planned early use of docetaxel can be considered convincing in accordance with the 
 guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials (ema/chmp/539146/2013) and 
 therefore supportive of the current application. 
 within this submission the mah has also provided 5-year os data from the study prevail. the study 
 prevail was a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study in 1,717 patients with metastatic castration 
 resistant prostate cancer (mcrpc) who were chemotherapy naïve. patients were randomised in a 1:1 
 ratio to receive either enzalutamide [160 mg once daily] (n=872) or placebo (n=845). in this study, os 
 and rpfs were co-primary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>
 an interim analysis for os was performed when 540 events had occurred, in which enzalutamide 
 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in os compared to placebo (hr 0.706 [95% ci: 
 0.60, 0.84]). after this specified interim analysis, the patients randomly assigned to placebo have been 
 offered by the independent dmc to pass to the enzalutamide treatment in the open-label period of the 
 study.</p><p>
 through this variation, the mah has provided 5-year os data based on data cut-off date of 30 sep 2017. 
 at the data cut-off, the number of patients enrolled in the open-label extension period was 520 (59.6%) 
 in the enzalutamide arm and 435 (51.5%) in the placebo arm. there were 234 patients (27,7%) on 
 placebo who crossed over to enzalutamide and received at least one dose or partial dose of study drug. 
 results of this final analysis, when 1,382 deaths had occurred (689 [79.0%] in the enzalutamide arm and 
 693 [82%] in the placebo arm), were statistically significant, with a hr of 0.835 [95% ci: 0.751, 0.928] 
 and a os median of 35.5 months in the enzalutamide arm versus 31.4% in the placebo arm.</p><p>
 these results confirm the clinical benefit of enzalutamide over placebo in the treatment of patients with 
 mcrpc chemotherapy naïve.</p><p>
 these results do not change the benefit/risk ratio (b/r) for enzalutamide and have been adequately 
 reflected in section 5.1 of the smpc. the b/r of enzalutamide remains positive.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.

 the results of study arches are supported by preliminary results from a subgroup of patients from study

 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>the safety profile of enzalutamide (mdv3100, asp9785) in support of its use for the treatment of patients with mhspc, is based on the safety results from the pivotal study arches (9785-cl-0335). in addition to 
 the arches study, safety data from the following studies have been included: 
 • a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with metastatic crpc previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (affirm [crpc2]). 
 • two phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, studies in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc (prevail [mdv3100-03] and asian prevail [9785-cl-0232]). the prevail study 
 provides long-term follow-up data (after all patients have been followed for a minimum of 5 years, 
 died, or were otherwise lost to follow-up or had withdrawn consent). in the asian prevail study, 
 data from site 105 was excluded due to data quality concerns. 
 • two randomised, bicalutamide-controlled, phase 2 studies in patients with metastatic crpc (terrain [9785-cl-0222]) and with nonmetastatic or metastatic crpc (strive [mdv3100-09]). 
 • a phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with nonmetastatic crpc (prosper [mdv3100-14]). 
 • a phase 3 randomised, study in patients with mhspc receiving treatment with first-line medical or surgical adt and optional concurrent docetaxel for metastatic prostate cancer (enzamet). as 
 enzamet was an investigator-initiated study conducted by a collaborative group (australian and 
 new zealand urogenital and prostate cancer trials group ltd. [anzup]) that maintains the 
 database for the study, these data are presented standalone as the safety data in this study were 
 not collected/handled in the same way as the other studies. only grade 3 and 4 adverse events 
 (aes), serious adverse events (saes) of any severity and death data are presented for the enzamet 
 study. 
 safety data are summarised for arches and 2 pools of studies with the presentation of a total of 5 groups 
 in order to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical safety of enzalutamide in these studies.

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with mhspc is based mainly on data from the pivotal phase 3 study arches in which 1,146 patients were treated with either enzalutamide + adt (n=572) or 
 placebo + adt (n=574). additionally, pooled data from 6 additional clinical trials (four phase 3 placebo-
 controlled studies in patients with crpc and two phase 2 studies in metastatic crpc) have been provided. 
 in total, the integrated safety population includes 4,081 patients treated with enzalutamide 160 mg/day 
 plus standard of care. of these, 24.7% had nonmetastatic prostate cancer and 75.3% had metastatic 
 disease. moreover, safety data from the phase 3 study enzamet, have been provided separately. in 
 study enzamet 563 patients were treated with enzalutamide + adt and 558 patients with nonsteroidal 
 antiandrogen + adt. 
 in the study arches the median duration of treatment was 12.8 months in the enzalutamide arm and 
 11.55 months in the placebo arm, with nearly 57% and 47% of patients being exposed ≥12 months to 
 &lt;24 months, in the enzalutamide and placebo arm, respectively. only 7 patients (6 enzalutamide and 1 
 placebo) received study drug ≥24 months. in the phase 3 studies pool, the extent of exposure was 
 longer, with 791 (28%) patients being exposed ≥24 months. to adjust for the duration of treatment, the 
 event rate of aes per 100 patient-years of exposure was also analysed (data not shown). at the time of 
 the data cut-off date 76% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 57% in the placebo arm were still on 
 treatment.</p><p>
 the study arches included patients with a median age of 70 years [range: 42, 92] (30% were ≥ 75 
 years). the majority of patients were white and had a good performance status (77.5% had ecog 0). 
 more than half of patients had a medical history of hypertension. patients with any clinically significant 
 cardiovascular disease as well as those with past history of seizure or any condition that may predispose 
 to seizure were excluded from the study (see smpc section 4.4).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 91/100 
 overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (teaes) was similar between treatment arms (&gt;85%) although teaes considered related to study drug were more frequent in the enzalutamide arm 
 (53% vs 47%). the most commonly reported (≥10%) teaes in the enzalutamide group were hot flush 
 (27.1% enzalutamide vs 22.3% placebo), fatigue (19.6% vs 15.3%) and arthralgia (12.2% vs 10.6%).</p><p>
 grade 3 or higher teaes were reported in 24.3% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 25.6% in the 
 placebo arm. the most frequently reported teaes of grade ≥3 were hypertension (3.3% enzalutamide vs 
 1.7% placebo), asthenia (1% vs 0.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (1% vs 0.5%) and syncope (1% 
 vs 0.2%).</p><p>
 teaes of special interest for enzalutamide are: seizure, hypertension, neutrophil count decreased, 
 cognitive and memory impairment, ischemic heart disease, other selected cardiovascular events, pres, 
 secondary primary malignancies, falls, fracture, fatigue, loss of consciousness, thrombocytopenia, 
 musculoskeletal events, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, angioedema and rash. teaes of special 
 interest with a higher incidence (&gt;2% or double) in the enzalutamide arm compared to placebo arm 
 were: hypertension (8.6% vs 6.3%), cognitive and memory impairment (4.5% vs 2.1%), fatigue (24.1% 
 vs 19.5%), fractures (6.5% vs 4.2%), loss of consciousness (1.6% vs 0.2%) and angioedema (1.2% vs 
 0.2%). at study entry, more than half of patients had hypertension at baseline. among these, the 
 incidence of hypertension was 9% in the enzalutamide arm compared to 5.3% in the placebo arm.</p><p>
 no events of pres or severe cutaneous reactions were reported in the enzalutamide arm and there was 
 one event of dermatitis bullous in the placebo arm. 
 there were 2 (0.3%) events of seizure in each treatment arm. in the enzalutamide arm both events were 
 considered to be related to study drug and led to treatment discontinuation. a warning on seizure is 
 included in current the smpc.</p><p>
 ischemic heart disease is included as an adr in the smpc. in study arches, 10 (1.7%) patients in the 
 enzalutamide arm (8 [1.4%] in the placebo arm) reported an event of ischemic heart disease, being 
 angina pectoris the most frequently reported (4 [0.7%] enzalutamide vs none in the placebo arm). 
 additionally, there were 12 (2.3%) patients that reported other selected cardiovascular event, with 
 cardiac failure as the most commonly reported. cardiac failure was reported in 7 [1.2%] patients in the 
 enzalutamide arm and 3 (0.5%) patients in the placebo arm. in most of these cases several confounding 
 factors were present. however, the potential contribution of enzalutamide to events of cardiac failure 
 cannot be ruled out taking into account that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease were 
 excluded from the study. nevertheless, it is not possible to draw any conclusion on the possible causal 
 relationship with enzalutamide based on the available data. cardiac failure should be monitored through 
 routine pharmacovigilance activities.</p><p>
 in patients with a baseline history of other selected cardiovascular events (23.3% in the enzalutamide 
 arm and 19.9% in the placebo arm), no differences were observed between treatment arms whereas in 
 patients without a baseline history the incidence was higher in the enzalutamide arm (8 [1.4%] vs 3 
 [0.5%]). overall, the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in study arches was low, however, it 
 should be taken into account that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. 
 myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable angina within 3 months prior to 
 screening, etc) were excluded from the study (see smpc section 4.4).</p><p>
 in the arches study second primary malignancies were reported in 10 (1.7%) patients in the 
 enzalutamide arm and 11 (1.9%) patients in the placebo arm. in previous phase 3 clinical trials, the 
 incidence of second primary malignancies in the enzalutamide arm compared to placebo was 2.9% vs 
 0.9%, respectively. despite the number of events reported is low, it should be kept in mind that 
 enzalutamide has shown to be carcinogenic in non-clinical trials (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
 in non-clinical trials, the most prominent neoplastic findings were benign leydig cell tumours, urothelium</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 92/100 
 papilloma, and carcinoma of urinary bladder. a similar pattern is observed in clinical trials. in the total enzalutamide population (n=4081) bladder cancer was the most frequently reported malignancy (9 
 [0.2%]). the mechanism is not completely elucidated. although a causal relationship is not formally 
 established, the potential risk of enzalutamide to develop second primary malignancies, especially urinary 
 bladder cancer, cannot be ruled out. section 4.4 of the smpc was recently updated 
 (emea/h/c/002639/ii/0049) to include a warning mentioning that patients should be advised to promptly 
 seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic 
 haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with 
 enzalutamide. 
 with regard to deaths, at the time of data cut-off, 39 (6.8%) patients in the enzalutamide arm and 
 45 (7.8%) patients in the placebo arm had died. disease progression was the leading cause in both 
 treatment arms (4.5% vs 7.8%, enzalutamide and placebo, respectively). deaths due to teaes were 
 slightly higher in the enzalutamide arm (14 [2.4%] vs 10 [1.7%]). malignant neoplasm progression was 
 the leading cause (4 [0.7%] and there were 3 deaths related to cardiac disorders (cardio-respiratory 
 arrest, cardiopulmonary failure and myocardial infarction). no patient in the enzalutamide plus adt group 
 had a fatal teae that was considered to be study drug-related. 
 serious teaes were reported by 18.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 19.5% in the placebo 
 group. in the enzalutamide arm, malignant neoplasm progression was the only serious teae reported in 
 at least 1% of patients. serious teaes were considered drug-related by the investigator in 22 (3.8%) 
 patients in the enzalutamide plus adt group and 16 patients (2.8%) patients in the placebo plus adt 
 group. 
 overall, enzalutamide appears to be well tolerated, taking into account the relatively low rate of 
 treatment discontinuations (7.2% enzalutamide vs 5.2% placebo) as well as dose reductions (4.4% 
 enzalutamide vs 1.9% placebo) and dose interruptions (7.3% enzalutamide vs 6.3% placebo). 
 regarding safety in special populations, no major differences in terms of teaes, saes and grade ≥3 
 teaes according to baseline weight, geographic region, history of hypertension, age and history of 
 significant cv disease were observed (data not shown) considering teaes of special interest, in the study 
 arches a slightly higher incidence of memory impairment was reported in the subgroup of patients ≥85 
 years treated with enzalutamide. memory impairment is a common adverse reaction included in section 
 4.8 of the smpc. 
 during the procedure, updated safety data, with three months of additional follow-up, were provided for 
 study arches. at the time of the new data cut-off (3 jan 2019), median treatment exposure in the 
 enzalutamide+adp arm was of 15.90 months and 13.80 months in the placebo+adt arm (data not 
 shown). no major differences were observed in the safety profile of enzalutamide plus adt compared to 
 previous data submitted, apart from a slight increase in the incidence of several teaes. however, this is 
 not unexpected since updated data add only 3 months of additional follow-up. therefore, and taking into 
 account that a high percentage of patients remained on treatment at the time of the data cut-off (around 
 71% in the enzalutamide plus adt group) the mah is recommended to provide an updated safety 
 analysis with final results of the arches study (rec). 
 overall, the safety profile of enzalutamide in the arches study was in line with its already known safety 
 profile. the incidence of adverse events was generally lower in the arches study compared to phase 3 
 studies. pharmacovigilance activities in place are considered sufficient to address the risks associated with 
 enzalutamide. within this application the mah is also proposing a minor change in section 4.7 effects on 
 ability to drive and use machines of the smpc which is considered in line with the safety profile of xtandi.</p><p>

 disease or condition</header><p>the claimed indication is for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (adt). 
 for patients with this advanced stage of the disease, the aim of treatment is to improve the symptoms in 
 particular pain and to extend the time during which the disease can be controlled with androgen 
 deprivation therapy to delay progression.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.2">3.1.2.  
 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>adt has been the basis for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic hspc. adt is defined as surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with gonadotropin-releasing 
 hormone (gnrh) agonists or antagonists. the aim of adt treatment is to reduce testosterone 
 concentrations. even though the majority of patients have an initial response to treatment with adt, 
 most men progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
 treatment options for men with mhspc have expanded beyond adt alone. docetaxel (75 mg/m
 2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) has been shown to improve overall survival (os) and failure-free survival (ffs) in 
 patients with mhspc in multiple studies, including chaarted and arm c of the stampede trial and has 
 been approved for the treatment of mhspc.</p><p>
 furthermore, abiraterone in combination with adt and prednisone or prednisolone was authorised in eu 
 for the treatment of adult men with newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate 
 cancer. 
 recently apalutamide has also been approved in adult men for the treatment of metastatic hormone-
 sensitive prostate cancer (mhspc) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (adt) (see epar 
 erleada).</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.  
 main clinical studies</header><p>the efficacy data in support of this application for the extension of indication is based mainly on the study 9785-cl-0335 (arches), a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
 enzalutamide plus adt versus placebo plus adt in 1,150 patients with mhspc.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 patients received enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily (n=574) or placebo (n=576). patients with metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or metastatic lesions on 
 ct or mri scan (for soft tissue) were eligible. patients whose disease spread was limited to regional pelvic 
 lymph nodes were not eligible. patients were allowed to receive up to 6 cycles of docetaxel therapy with 
 final treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1 and no evidence of disease 
 progression during or after the completion of docetaxel therapy. 
 radiographic progression-free survival (rpfs), based on independent central review, was the primary 
 endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease 
 progression or death whichever occurred first.</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.  
 favourable effects</header><p>results from the study arches at the data cut-off date of 14 oct 2018 include the main planned analysis for rpfs based on independent central review assessment (primary endpoint) and the first interim 
 analysis for os (secondary endpoint).</p><p>
 a statistically significant treatment effect on rpfs in favour of enzalutamide was observed, with a hr of 
 0.39 (95% ci: 0.3, 0.5). at the time of data cut-off median rpfs was not reached in the enzalutamide 
 arm and was of 19.0 months in the placebo arm. overall, subgroup analysis and several sensitivity 
 analyses performed support the results of the primary analysis. 
 to adjust for multiplicity, a parallel testing strategy was used to test os with an allocated type i error 
 rate of 0.04 and the remaining 5 key secondary endpoints (time to psa progression, time to start of a 
 new antineoplastic therapy, rate of psa decline to &lt;0.2 ng/ml, orr and time to deterioration in urinary 
 symptoms from the qlq-pr25) with an allocated type i error rate of 0.01.</p><p>
 statistically significant improvements in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo were 
 observed for all key secondary endpoints except time to deterioration in urinary symptoms from the qlq-
 pr25. 
 regarding os, at the time of data cut-off, data were still immature and the statistical significance was not 
 reached (hr 0.81 [95% ci: 0.53, 1.25]; p=0.3361). a trend in favour of enzalutamide was observed.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>based on os analysis submitted at the data cut off 14 oct 2018 on a total of 84 deaths (24.6% of the 342 events required for the final analysis) the effect of enzalutamide on os is uncertain. nevertheless, 
 based on the totality of data (effect on rpfs and secondary endpoint) a detrimental effect on os can be 
 excluded. further os data are expected to be submitted as soon as available (rec).</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>in the study arches, the median duration of treatment was 12.8 months in the enzalutamide arm and 11.55 months in the placebo arm.</p><p>
 the most frequently reported (≥10%) teaes in the enzalutamide arm were hot flush (27.1% 
 enzalutamide vs 22.3% placebo) and fatigue (19.6% vs 15.3%).</p><p>
 grade 3 or higher teaes were reported by 24.3% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 25.6% in the 
 placebo arm. the most frequently reported teaes of grade ≥3 were hypertension (3.3% enzalutamide vs 
 1.7% placebo), asthenia (1% vs 0.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (1% vs 0.5%) and syncope (1% 
 vs 0.2%).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/202601/2021</p><p>
 page 97/100 
 serious teaes were reported by 18.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 19.5% in the placebo group. serious teaes were considered drug-related by the investigator in 22 (3.8%) patients in the 
 enzalutamide plus adt group and 16 patients (2.8%) patients in the placebo plus adt group. 
 treatment was discontinued due to a teae in 7.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 5.2% in the 
 placebo arm. decreased appetite, diarrhoea and fatigue were the main teaes that led to treatment 
 discontinuation.</p><p>
 dose reductions and dose interruptions were required, respectively, in 4.4% and 7.3% of patients in the 
 enzalutamide arm compared to 1.9% and 6.3% of patients in the placebo arm. 
 teaes of special interest for enzalutamide are: seizure, hypertension, neutrophil count decreased, 
 cognitive and memory impairment, ischemic heart disease, other selected cardiovascular events 
 (hemorrhagic central nervous system vascular conditions, ischemic central nervous system vascular 
 conditions and cardiac failure), pres, secondary primary malignancies, falls, fracture, fatigue, , 
 thrombocytopenia, musculoskeletal events, severe cutaneous adverse reactions and rash.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.
