 hemophilia a.</p></section><section><header>description</header><p>study 3001 was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multiple-arm, phase 3 extension study to investigate the safety and efficacy of rviii-singlechain in ptps and pups with severe hemophilia a 
 (fviii activity levels &lt; 1%). the study aimed to evaluate routine prophylaxis and on-demand 
 treatment of bleeding episodes in at least 200 ptps who achieved at least 100 eds to rviii-singlechain 
 (study arms 1 and 3) as well as in pups who achieved at least 50 eds (study arm 2). 
 a main objective of this study was to collect information on inhibitor formation in pups 0 to &lt; 18 years 
 of age. in this regard, the ema guideline in effect in 2011 stated that approval of the indication in pups 
 will be based on a clinical trial in a minimum of 50 pups evaluated for efficacy and safety during at 
 least 50 eds. thus, in line with the guideline in effect at time of study planning and implementation of 
 study amendment 3, this extension study was planned to a) fulfill the ema requirements for a 
 postmarketing investigation to attain 100 eds in at least 200 ptps (completed) and b) acquire efficacy 
 and safety data in at least 50 pups attaining at least 50 eds to rviii-singlechain. per protocol 
 amendment 4, the number of pups was reduced to at least 24, with each pup remained in the study 
 until they achieved at least 75 eds (study amendment 5). 
 a surgical substudy (open to subjects from all study arms) investigated the use of rviii-singlechain in 
 surgery. additionally, an immune tolerance induction (iti) substudy in pups was implemented to 
 investigate the use of rviii-singlechain as iti therapy in pups who develop an inhibitor to rviii-
 singlechain in the main study.

 secondary objectives (pups [arm 2]): 
 • to further characterize the safety profile of rviii-singlechain with respect to inhibitor development. 
 • to characterize the safety profile of rviii-singlechain with respect to antibodies against rviii-singlechain and antibodies to chinese hamster ovary (cho) proteins. 
 • to collect and evaluate the number of rviii-singlechain injections required for the treatment of bleeding episodes. 
 • to characterize consumption of rviii-singlechain in prophylaxis, on-demand treatment, and surgery. 
 • to assess the hemostatic efficacy of rviii-singlechain for pups who undergo surgery, using the 4-point efficacy evaluation of surgical treatment scale. 
 • to assess the occurrence of clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs after rviii-singlechain administration. 
 exploratory objectives (pups [arm 2]): 
 • to characterize the relationship between inhibitor development and exposure to rviii-singlechain in pups. 
 • immune tolerance induction (iti) substudy: to investigate the use of rviii-singlechain in iti in pups who develop an inhibitor to rviii-singlechain.</p></section><section><header>study design</header><p>the study was a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, multiple-arm extension study. it was performed at study sites in 7 countries (italy, lebanon, malaysia, netherlands, portugal, south africa, 
 united states). eligible subjects were males diagnosed with severe hemophilia a (fviii activity levels 
 &lt; 1%). subjects in arm 1 were ptps who had participated in a previous csl-sponsored clinical study 
 with rviii-singlechain. subjects in arm 3 were ptps who had not participated in a previous csl-
 sponsored clinical study with rviii-singlechain. subjects in arm 2 were pups who had not participated 
 in any clinical study with rviii-singlechain and had no other prior exposure to any fviii product.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 blood products). exclusion criteria include family history of fviii inhibitors, known other coagulations 
 disorder, receiving non-permitted therapy, prior evidence of thrombosis, hypersensitivity to rviii-
 singlechain or any excipients or cho proteins, low platelet count at screening, hiv-positive subjects 
 (exceptions possible).</p><p>
 for the iti substudy, eligible pups of arm 2 had to show an inhibitor titer ≥ 0.6 bu/ml (confirmed by 
 repeat testing at the central laboratory). ptps, subjects with evidence of thrombosis or planned 
 immunosuppressive therapy or inhibitor relapse (2 consecutive inhibitor samples with an inhibitor titer 
 ≥ 0.6 bu/ml, analyzed by the central laboratory after a successful first iti attempt) were not to be 
 enrolled. 
 as per protocol amendment 4, dated 01 october 2019, this study was planned to enroll a total of at 
 least 200 ptps with at least 100 eds (arms 1 and 3) and at least 24 pups (arm 2). any subject 
 requiring surgery during the course of the study could participate in the surgery substudy, with the 
 exception of inhibitor positive pups as the surgical procedure should be covered by a bypassing agent 
 and not by rviii-singlechain.</p></section><section><header>treatments</header><p>in arm 2 (pups), the investigator determined the rviii-singlechain dose and dosing schedule at their discretion, taking into consideration the world federation of hemophilia (wfh) guidelines (2012), 
 subject age, and other disease characteristics (eg, bleeding phenotype). in the event of a bleeding 
 episode, subjects were treated at a dose predetermined by the investigator based on the type and 
 severity of the bleeding episode. the desired fviii level for the treatment of a bleeding episode (on-
 demand treatment) was based on the wfh guidelines (2012).</p><p>
 inhibitor negative subjects remained in the study until they achieved 75 eds with rviii-singlechain. 
 for iti therapy, the timepoint of initiation was determined by the investigator based on the inhibitor 
 titer and taking into account the criteria outlined below. at the investigator’s discretion, the following 
 subjects could have an optional waiting period of up to 6 months prior iti therapy (inhibitor titer of &gt; 
 10 bu/ml and to allow the inhibitor titer to decrease to ≤ 10 bu/ml, need for a central venous access 
 device for iti therapy). during the waiting period, the subject must not receive any dose of rviii-
 singlechain, and bleeding episodes had to be treated with bypassing agents. subjects eligible for iti 
 were to assign either low-dose regimen of 50 iu/kg 3 times weekly or intermediate-dose regimen of 
 100 iu/kg daily, or high-dose regimen of 200 iu/kg daily (may be split into 2 doses of 100 iu/kg 
 daily). a change to a less intense regimen if the subject’s inhibitor titer showed a decrease was 
 permitted to avoid excessively high fviii levels. iti treatment was to continue until iti success 
 (inhibitor titer of &lt; 0.6 bu/ml at 2 consecutive visits), iti therapy failure (24 months of iti therapy 
 without achieving inhibitor eradication), or subject discontinuation, whichever occurred first.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 efficacy analysis 
 the pup efficacy population comprised all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of rviii-
 singlechain for either routine prophylaxis treatment or on-demand treatment during the study. the 
 pup surgery population comprised all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of rviii-
 singlechain for surgical prophylaxis. the iti population included all pups who received at least 1 dose 
 of rviii-singlechain to treat their inhibitor. the number of bleeds and the number of treated bleeds 
 were presented. the investigator’s clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for the treatment of 
 major bleeding episodes, based on the 4-point ordinal scale (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, “poor / 
 no response”), was tabulated. the percentage of major bleeding episodes treated successfully (defined 
 as ratings of “excellent” or “good”) was summarized and reported together with a 2-sided 95% ci. to 
 estimate the proportion, the denominator included all treated bleeding episodes categorized as major. 
 to account for within-subject correlation, generalized linear modeling using sas’ genmod procedure 
 was utilized. the model contained only the intercept term. the binomial distribution with logit link 
 function was specified. the investigator’s clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for the treatment 
 of nonmajor bleeding episodes was analyzed as described for major bleeding episodes above. abr was 
 presented for total, traumatic, unknown, and joint bleeds. a summary of abr by inhibitor status was 
 performed if the efficacy evaluation period was ≥ 8 weeks for the given inhibitor status. the asbr was</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 11/39</p><p>
 summarized by regimen (on-demand or prophylaxis) using descriptive statistics. in addition, the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes per year and associated 95% ci was estimated based on a 
 poisson distribution. generalized linear modeling using sas’ genmod procedure was utilized. the 
 poisson distribution with log link function and log time offset was specified. the number and 
 percentage of bleeding episodes requiring 1, 2, 3, or &gt; 3 injections of rviii-singlechain to achieve 
 hemostasis were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. the consumption of rviii-
 singlechain, was derived and expressed in terms of iu/kg per month, iu/kg per year, total iu per 
 injection, per month and per year. consumption was summarized using descriptive statistics for on-
 demand, prophylaxis, and surgery. 
 surgical substudy 
 the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis based on 
 the 4-point ordinal efficacy evaluation for surgical treatment scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor / 
 no response) was tabulated overall and by type of surgery (ie, emergency surgeries, nonemergency 
 surgeries). the treatment success rate, defined as the percentage of surgical hemostasis ratings of 
 excellent or good, was presented. the following information was summarized using descriptive 
 statistics, or presented qualitatively as appropriate: predicted and estimated blood loss during surgery; 
 predicted and actual transfusion requirements during surgery; change in hemoglobin levels between 
 baseline, during surgery, and after surgery. 
 iti population 
 a summary of the consumption of rviii-singlechain for inhibitor treatment period was provided. 
 number and percentages of subjects achieving an eradication to iti treatment with rviii-singlechain 
 was presented with a 2-sided exact 95% ci. the percentage of subjects achieving an eradication was 
 calculated based on the iti population. 
 other efficacy analyses 
 the characteristics of bleeding episodes including the type of event (traumatic or spontaneous or 
 unknown causality) and the location of bleeding (joint, muscle, mucosal or other) were summarized 
 using frequency counts and percentages. 
 safety analysis 
 safety analysis was based on safety population. the safety population comprised all the pup enrolled 
 population who received at least 1 dose of rviii-singlechain during the study for any reason (eg, 
 surgery, routine prophylaxis, on-demand treatment). incidence of transient inhibitors (negative results 
 within 6 months after positive result) in pups was also provided. kaplan-meier (km) estimates were 
 used to analyze the cumulative risk of occurrence overall, for subjects with low-titer (ie, inhibitor titer 
 of ≤ 5 bu/ml) and high-titer (&gt; 5 bu/ml) inhibitor formation over increasing exposure to rviii-
 singlechain. the number of subjects at risk and the rate of both low-titer and high-titer occurrence 
 were summarized. the number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 adverse event 
 (ae) and the number of events were summarized by system organ class (soc) and preferred term 
 (pt). additional treatment-emergent ae (teae) summaries included all aes (including teaes and aes 
 that were not treatment-emergent), related teaes, teaes by maximum severity, teaes leading to 
 death, treatment-emergent serious adverse events (te saes), related saes, and teaes leading to 
 withdrawal. laboratory parameters (hematology and biochemistry), noninhibitory antidrug antibodies 
 (adas) screening test results, and test results for antibodies against cho cells were summarized. all 
 other safety data (cluster of differentiation 4 [cd4] lymphocyte count, virology, vital signs, physical 
 examination, and incremental recovery [ir]) were summarized using descriptive statistics and were 
 listed.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 for subjects enrolled in the iti substudy and included in the iti population, inhibitor titer over time was summarized. the historical peak titer (ie, the highest inhibitor titer before initiation of iti 
 treatment) and the peak titer during iti treatment were identified for each subject and summarized 
 separately.</p></section><section><header>results</header></section><section><header>recruitment/ number analysed</header><p>overall, arm 2 of study 3001 included 24 pups aged 0 to 5 years, of whom 21 subjects (87.5%) attained &gt; 50 eds.

 the study as per physician’s decision, 1 subject discontinued because of an ae (high-titer inhibitor) 
 before the iti substudy was implemented, and 1 subject (4.2%) discontinued because of overseas 
 relocation. of the 24 pups, 12 were initially assigned to on-demand treatment. 11 on-demand subjects 
 switched to a once-weekly prophylaxis regimen, and this switch occurred between 9 and 650 days

 efficacy in inhibitor-positive subjects 
 of the 24 subjects who were enrolled to arm 2 and exposed to rviii-singlechain, 12 subjects tested 
 positive for inhibitors (6 had a high-titer range peak inhibitor, and 6 had a low-titer range peak 
 inhibitor value).</p><p>73 bleeding events occurred in 9 inhibitor-positive subjects while their inhibitor status

 of the 19 treated bleeding events: 
 • three were rated as “poor / no response” (closest inhibitor titer result before the bleeding event) (proximal titers: 2.55, 28.5, and 5.90 bu/ml). 
 • three were rated as “moderate” (proximal titers: 1.35, 4.02, and 1.82 bu/ml). • three were rated as “good” (proximal titers: 1.78, 1.78, and 1.30 bu/ml). • ten were rated as “excellent” (proximal titers: 0.66, 1.06, 1.49, 0.92, 0.71, 0.68, 4.0, 15.5, 14.5, and 7.80 bu/ml).

 in the iti population, 11 subjects received treatment with rviii-singlechain; 6 of the 11 subjects were 
 enrolled in the iti substudy: 5 subjects received a low-dose (50 iu/kg 3 times weekly) regimen and 1 
 subject received high-dose (200 iu/kg daily) iti regimen. the mean (sd) number of eds was 124.2 
 (98.79) eds and 7 subjects (63.6%) attained &gt; 50 eds during their inhibitor treatment period. 
 primary endpoint: inhibitor against fviii 
 the primary safety endpoint was incidence of high-titer inhibitor formation to fviii (ie, inhibitor titer of 
 &gt; 5 bethesda unit [bu]/ml) in pups with at least 50 eds of rviii-singlechain. 
 twenty-four subjects were enrolled and exposed to rviii-singlechain during the study, and 12 
 subjects (50.0%) tested positive for inhibitors. of these, 6 subjects (25.0% of total, primary safety 
 endpoint) had a peak inhibitor value in the high-titer range, and 6 subjects (25.0% of total) had a 
 peak inhibitor value in the low-titer range. the overall median eds for initial inhibitor development was 
 10 eds (range 4 to 23 eds). median eds for initial inhibitor development in high titer subjects was 9.0 
 eds (range 4 to 23 eds) and in low titer subjects was 10 eds (range 5 to 23 eds). of the 12 inhibitor-
 positive subjects, 1 subject was withdrawn from the study because of protocol requirement as a result 
 of high inhibitor titer at diagnosis (8.50 bu/ml); following this the protocol was amended to allow 
 subjects diagnosed with inhibitor to continue participation in the study and enroll into the iti substudy. 
 1 subject was withdrawn after entering the iti substudy (physician’s decision), and 1 subject had 
 inhibitor-positive status at study end.</p><p>secondary endpoint: noninhibitory antidrug antibodies (adas) 
 twelve subjects (50.0%) developed noninhibitory adas during the study. eight of the 12 subjects who 
 developed noninhibitory adas were positive for inhibitors; 6 subjects had high-titer and 2 subjects had 
 low-titer. two of these 12 subjects (8.3%) were confirmed to be positive for noninhibitory adas by the 
 eos (1 subject had high-titer inhibitor and the other subject was not positive for inhibitor). 
 secondary endpoint: antibodies to chinese hamster ovary host cell proteins 
 none of the subjects developed antibodies against cho host cell proteins 
 adverse events 
 treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes): all subjects in the pup safety population experienced at 
 least 1 teae. a total of 320 teaes were reported (12 severe, 93 moderate, 208 mild). the highest 
 frequency of teaes were in the system organ class: infections and infestations (91.7%), general 
 disorders and administrative site conditions (66.7%), investigations (50.0%, n=12/24 of which were 
 n=12 inhibiting antibodies positive and n=6 anti-factor viii antibody positive), injury, poisoning and 
 procedural complications (37.5%), respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (33.3%), 
 gastrointestinal disorders (33.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33.3%), skin 
 and subcutaneous tissue disorders (29.2%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (25.0%), 
 vascular disorders (12.5%). of the teaes reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in the overall pup safety 
 population, the most commonly reported teaes were pyrexia (44 teaes) in 15 subjects, upper 
 respiratory tract infection (18) in 7 subjects, nasopharyngitis (15) in 9 subjects, and inhibitor 
 development (14 teaes; inhibiting antibodies positive [7], anti-factor viii antibody positive [6], and 
 factor viii inhibition [1]) in 13 subjects.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 22/39</p><p>
 related teaes: twelve subjects (50%) had a total of 17 teaes related to rviii-singlechain, the majority of which were inhibitors development (14 teaes, 82.4%). the other were fatigue (n=1), 
 pyrexia (n=1), and haemorrhage (n=1). one severe te sae of inhibiting antibodies positive (high 
 titer) led to study discontinuation, which was related to rviii-singlechain and had not resolved at the 
 end of study. 
 adverse events of special interest (aesi): potential events of hypersensitivity reactions were 
 identified. ten subjects (41.7%) experienced 15 teaes that could be considered as symptoms or 
 manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions. these teaes were eczema (n=3 in 3 subjects), rash (n=3 
 in 3 subjects), bronchospasm (n=4 in 2 subjects), and conjunctivitis allergic, dermatitis allergic, eye 
 swelling, rash erythematous, rhinitis allergic (each occurring once in a single subject). upon medical 
 review, none of these teaes of special interest were confirmed as hypersensitivity reactions. 
 local tolerability: 21 subjects reported at least 1 self-assessment. no local reactions were reported for 
 99.7% of subject-assessed rviii-singlechain injections. a small proportion of injections were reported 
 as being associated with very slight to moderate local reactions, and there were no injections 
 associated with severe local reactions. the investigator’s assessment of erythema identified no reaction 
 in any of the assessed injections. 
 no deaths were reported in this study. no anaphylactic reactions or thromboembolic events were 
 reported. there were no notable findings relating to clinical laboratory or vital signs parameters. 
 of note, two subjects who experienced unrelated teaes of coronavirus test positive recovered. 
 other endpoint: incremental recovery 
 incremental recovery (ir) was assessed as a pk (and safety) parameter in 6 pups who participated in 
 the iti substudy to monitor inhibitor development. incremental recovery was assessed in the 6 pups in 
 the iti substudy. as expected for subjects with inhibitors, all subjects had at least 1 post-dose fviii 
 activity level that was below the limit of quantification or much lower than normal. three subjects had 
 low ir values that increased over time as the inhibitor was eradicated.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.3">2.3.3.  
 discussion on clinical aspects</header><p>afstyla is a recombinant single-chain factor viii (rviii-singlechain, inn: lonoctocog alfa) indicated for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia a as 
 replacement therapy. the active substance is a b-domain truncated variant of human factor viii 
 defined by covalently bonded fviii heavy and light chains within a single polypeptide structure. 
 marketing authorisation valid throughout the european union was granted on 04 january 2017 on the 
 basis of two main studies. the first study was conducted in previously treated adult/adolescent 
 subjects with severe haemophilia a, the second study involved paediatric ptps below 12 years of age. 
 in accordance with the ema requirements for the postmarketing investigation and the clinical guideline 
 on fviii products in effect in 2011, a third study, coded csl 627_3001, was conducted to evaluate 
 routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in at least 200 ptps who achieved 
 at least 100 eds and in pups who achieved at least 50 eds. the study was titled “a phase 3 open-
 label, multicenter, extension study to assess the safety and efficacy of recombinant coagulation 
 factor viii (rviii-singlechain, csl627) in subjects with severe hemophilia a”. a summary of the final 
 results from ptps in this study (arms 1 and 3, completed for ptps in december 2018) was already 
 submitted to ema in january 2020 (ectd sequence 68 / procedure reference 
 emea/h/c/004075/mea/002.1). the final report for ptps dated 28 november 2019.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 23/39</p><p>
 now, the mah submitted a final report from pups of this study (arm 2), in accordance with article 46 of regulation (ec) no1901/2006. the main goal of this study arm was to acquire efficacy and safety 
 data in at least 50 pups treated at least for 50 eds with rviii-singlechain. the number of pups was 
 reduced to at least 24 per protocol amendment 4.</p><p>and the study was completed in january 2021 (last 
 subject visit, csr dated june 2021). it is noted that no change to product information is planned. 
 arm 2 of study 3001 included 24 pups with a mean age of 1.4 years (range 0-5), 21 subjects (87.5%) 
 achieved &gt; 50 eds. 11/12 initially on-demand treated subjects switched to prophylaxis regimen giving 
 a total of n=23 subjects in the prophylaxis group. 19 subjects completed the study, 5 discontinued. of 
 note, not all pre-planned secondary or explorative analyses have been appropriately described in the 
 final report. it should be noted that due to the early stop of enrolment, the significance of some 
 endpoints is compromised anyway. there is no serious concern for study conduct, ten major protocol 
 deviations were found (3x dosing, 2x visit/procedural, 2x laboratory noncompliance, 1x visit schedule, 
 2x other), none led to study discontinuation. 
 a primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success for major bleeding episodes. a total of 315 bleeding 
 episodes were treated with rviii-singlechain (312 were treated with rviii-singlechain alone, 3 were 
 additionally treated with bypassing agent). one bleeding episode was a major bleeding, i.e. a 
 spontaneous bleeding in right knee, and this was successfully treated (“excellent” rating on a 4-point 
 efficacy scale, no other medication was taken aside from afstyla and 1 infusion was required to achieve 
 haemostasis). 54 of 60 (90.0%) nonmajor classified bleeding episodes have been successfully treated. 
 in total, 290 of 315 (92.1%) bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or “good”. in 
 88.9% of all treated bleeding episodes 1-2 injections of afstyla were sufficient to achieve hemostasis, 
 8.9% of treated bleeding episodes required ≥ 3 injections to achieve hemostasis. in addition, 
 haemostatic efficacy was evaluated by inhibitor status and treatment success was 93.6% in the 
 absence and 68.4% in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. annualized bleeding rates in the pups 
 were further study objectives. the median abr for the on-demand treatment regimen was 3.76 (range 
 0.0-17.1, mean: 5.12) for all bleeds (spontaneous bleeds median abr 1.15, range 0.0-5.6, mean abr 
 1.9). the median abr for the prophylaxis treatment regimen was 1.84 (range 0.0-23.6, mean 5.94) 
 for all bleeds (spontaneous bleeds median abr 0.88, range 0.0-19.7, mean abr 4.04).</p><p>
 treatment of inhibitor-positive subjects was an exploratory objective, and therefore does not 
 necessarily has further implications for the product labelling. however, to briefly brief summarize this 
 effort, consumption data during iti are provided and inhibitor eradication is described. 9/11 subjects 
 (81.8%) who were treated for their inhibitors achieved inhibtor eradication which was achieved at a 
 median of 37 eds (range 16-194) and median of 14 weeks (range 7.7-64.4). of note, only 6/11 
 subjects received a low-dose (50 iu/kg 3 times weekly, n=5) or high-dose (200 iu/kg daily, n=1) iti 
 regimen. clarification is requested regarding the correlation of treatment regimen and treatment 
 succes, and whether iti could be reflected in the product information.</p><p>
 overall, favourable efficacy was demonstrated in the on-demand and prophylactic treatment of pups 
 and the data are line with the benefits shown in other afstyla studies. on-demand treatment of 
 bleeding episodes was efficacious, the vast majority of treated bleedings was sufficiently controlled by 
 1 or 2 injections of afstyla. no concerns arise from consumption data, total consumption for all 
 prophylactically treated subjects was 5346 iu/kg per year (median 4784, range 1383-12520) which is 
 a common range for haemophilia a subjects, including pups. no firm conclusion can be drawn from the 
 abr data due to the small sample size, yet the reported rates do not give cause for concern and 
 commonly reflect typical ranges for the pups (keipert, müller-olling et al. 2020; yaish et al. 2020). 
 treatment success during surgery was evaluated in 3 cases (2x circumcision, 1x port placement). 
 further clarifications are requested regarding the surgery efficacy ratings, yet despite its small size 
 data rather support a favourable profile.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 24/39</p><p>
 the primary safety objective was to evaluate the development of fviii inhibitory antibodies. in total, 12/24 (50%) pups were positive for inhibitors. 6 subjects each (25% of total) had inhibitor values in 
 the high-titer and in the low-titer range, respectively. initial all-titer inhibitor development was 
 observed at a median of 10 eds (range 4-23). for high-titer and low-titer development, initial 
 occurrence was observed at median of 9 and 10 eds, respectively. this is considered a typical time 
 course for inhibitor development. in fact, most inhibitors develop within the first 50 eds with 50% of 
 inhibitor already presenting within the first 15 eds (van den berg et al. 2018; keipert et al. 2018). of 
 note, the mean number of eds for all pups was 245.5 (median 230, min-max range 5-639). 21 
 subjects (87.5%) achieved at least 50 eds, 2 subjects achieved &lt;10 eds and 1 subject &gt;10 eds. 
 further clarification is requested for inhibitor status in the 3 subjects not having achieved 50 eds. 
 in line with the ema fviii referral, it is acknowledged that the lack of direct comparative data is 
 stressing the significance of reported inhibitor incidence rates and inhibitor frequency for pups is 
 reported as ‘very common’ in the current smpc of afstyla. with further reference made to ema 
 assessment report of the fviii referral (ema/763977/2017), for most recombinant fviii products all-
 titer inhibitor frequencies range from 15 to 38% and high-titer inhibitors are in the range of 9-22.6%. 
 a recent meta-analysis likewise showed that all-titer inhibitor rates are in the range of 26-40% for 
 recombinant fviii products, with an estimated frequency of 22% (95%ci: 18-27%) for high-titer 
 inhibitors (keipert et al. 2021). therefore, it is considered that the rates estimated in this study for 
 both all-titer and high-titer inhibtors are in the upper range or above the frequencies already 
 described. the clinical relevance of this finding remains uncertain. 
 other safety endpoints referred to non-inhibitory adas and adverse events including the potential for 
 hypersensitivity reaction. 12 subjects had noninhibitory adas with strong intra-subject overlap of also 
 having inhibitory antibodies. events potentially related to hypersensitivity reactions were identified, i.e. 
 10 subjects experienced 15 such teaes including eczema, rash, and bronchospasm. these events were 
 not confirmed as related after medical review; however, the applicant is requested to provide further 
 details in this regard. no other important or new safety issues were identified. no deaths, no 
 anaphylactic reactions, no thromboembolic events were reported. 
 for regulatory consideration, the applicant has stated that the study objective was in accordance with 
 the ema guideline in effect at date of study initiation. of note, the study period for pups was august 
 2015 (first subject visit) until january 2021 (last subject visit). the guideline on the clinical 
 investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor viii products currently into effect, i.e. 
 since 01 february 2019 (ema/chmp/bpwp/144533/2009 rev. 2), removed the obligation to perform 
 clinical trials in pups and instead requests post-authorisation studies based on a set of core data 
 elements to be collected in haemophilia registries. it is further stated that the applicant has reached an 
 agreement with the ema paediatric committee through a request for modification of the pediatric 
 investigational plan (pip) to stop enrolling subjects into study csl627_3001. accordingly, the iti 
 substudy had been extended to sufficiently follow up all inhibitor-positive pups.</p><p>
 overall, post-authorisation pup data were submitted in accordance with article 46 of the paediatric 
 regulation and support the favourable benefit-risk balance of afstyla. given the change of the 
 regulatory landscape from conducting clinical trials in pups to collecting such data within haemophilia 
 registries, the stop of this study and final report of pup data is considered acceptable. the 
 disadvantage, however, is that statistical significance of the submitted data is compromised. additional 
 minor clarifications are requested to address identified issues in the efficacy and safety assessments. 
 currently, it remains unclear whether iti should be reflected in the product information. clarification is 
 requested in this regard as no change to the smpc has been proposed.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 for which a subject was required to seek treatment at the hemophilia center from the treating</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 physician for any episode that threatened the subject’s life or a loss of limb. examples of major bleeding episodes included intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe bleeding. all 
 other bleeding episodes were classified as nonmajor unless the investigator assessment noted 
 otherwise. 
 only 1 bleeding episode was considered as a major bleeding episode according to this definition and 
 this subject was treated successfully by the investigator at the site. for treatment of minor bleeding 
 episodes at home, the subjects or their caregivers recorded the information in the ediary and 
 discussed those bleeds at their next doctor appointment. in case of these minor bleeding episodes, the 
 ediary data were captured in the electronic study database without interference by the investigator. 
 this explains why not all bleeding episodes were classified by the investigator in the electronic case 
 report form (ecrf).</p></section><section><header>assessment of the mah’s responses</header><p>it is noted that a large number of home-treated minor bleeding episodes has not been classified by a study investigator.</p><p>

 background 
 in addition to the bleeding information, the actual afstyla total dose given and specific reason for 
 treatment were collected using ediary. the actual dose was entered in a device by the caregiver, and 
 the entered information are later linked to the electronic study database. all bleeding and dosing 
 information entered in the ediary were medically reviewed on a regular basis during the course of the 
 study. although most fields in the ediary can be automatically queried based their fixed number of 
 responses provided by the pull-down menus, other fields, like the total dose, were entered as a free 
 text. no range check could be applied automatically to total dose because it is based on the reason for 
 treatment. the investigator could either administer an assigned dose for routine prophylaxis or a high 
 bolus dose to treat a bleeding event. the challenge arises from verifying the total dose entered when 
 there is no source documentation. furthermore, if we were able to contact the caregiver, his/her 
 anecdotal response could be inaccurate due to the amount of time since the total dose was entered. 
 therefore, the total dose and other free text fields entered in the ediary remained unverified in our 
 study database. 
 although csl has initially considered to exclude the extreme values entered for total doses as possible 
 data entry errors in the descriptive summary statistics, this was not done because it could lead to 
 selection bias due to not fully understanding the nature and extent of inaccuracies in total doses. 
 therefore, csl analyzed total doses as entered by the caregiver, and based any conclusions related to</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 31/39</p><p>
 the total dose (e.g. consumption) on the median, which is less affected by extreme values, compared to the mean.</p></section><section><header>assessment of the mah’s responses</header><p>it is noted that the maximum dosing of 429 iu/kg for prophylactic infusion is likely to be an data entry error. mean, median, and q3 consumptions data generally do not give cause for concern.</p><p>

 enrolling the patient in the iti study. 
 the iti sub study allowed the investigator to assign either a low dose (50 iu/kg, 3x weekly), 
 intermediate dose (100 iu/kg daily), and high (200 iu/kg daily) regimen. the main study allowed the 
 investigator to increase the subject’s regimen to treat the inhibitor. csl decided to include all the 
 subjects who had any dose adjustment as iti population in order to evaluate the treatment response. 
 of the 11 subjects included in the iti population, 5 were enrolled into the iti sub-study on the low 
 dose regimen (50iu/kg, 3 times a week) and 1 received a high dose regimen (200 iu/kg daily). the 
 remaining 5 subjects remained in the main study; 4 received intensified prophylaxis regimens (3

 modification (30 iu/kg once weekly). the 5 subjects who remained in the main study had all achieved 
 inhibitor eradication.

 a total of 15 teaes were identified using the smq* hypersensitivity (narrow). two subjects (8.3%) 
 experienced a total of 4 events of bronchospasm (1 subject had 3 events of bronchospasm, 1 subject 
 had 1 event), 3 subjects (12.5%) experienced 1 event each of eczema and 3 subjects (12.5%) 
 experienced 1 event each of rash. the remaining 5 events were conjunctivitis allergic dermatitis 
 allergic, eye swelling, rash erythematous and rhinitis allergic; all reported in 1 subject each. all the 
 events were non-serious and of either mild or moderate severity. rviii-singlechain dose was not 
 changed following 12 of the events, while the action taken with the study treatment was reported as 
 not applicable for the remaining 3 events. for the latter 3 events, concomitant medication was 
 prescribed to treat them. the outcome was reported as recovered for all but one event (rash). all the 
 events were assessed as not related to rviii-singlechain by the investigator.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 csl would like to clarify that these were confirmed teaes. however, upon medical review, none of these teaes were confirmed as hypersensitivity reactions related to rviii-singlechain. 
 *smq: standardised meddra query</p></section><section><header>assessment of the mah’s responses</header><p>the applicant’s comments are acknowledged, the concerned teaes were assessed as not related by the study investigator. the potential for hypersensitivity reactions is flagged within the smpc (section 
 4.4 special warnings and precautions for use, section 4.8 undesirable effects - summary of the safety 
 profile) and these occur at common frequency (section 4.8 undesirable effects - tabulated list of 
 adverse reactions).</p><p>
 point clarified.</p></section><section><header>question 9</header><p>aside from the 14 related teaes of inhibitor development, fatigue (n=1), pyrexia (n=1), and haemorrhage (n=1) have been reported. pyrexia is already included in the tabulated list of adverse 
 reactions of the afstyla smpc, however, fatigue and haemorrhage are not. further clarification is 
 requested.</p></section><section><header>mah’s responses</header><p>csl acknowledges the assessor’s request and would like to provide further clarification. one subject experienced intermittent fatigue of mild severity assessed as nonserious and related to 
 rviii-singlechain by the investigator. the dose of rviii-singlechain was not changed and no other 
 action was taken. the outcome was reported as not recovered. a month prior to this event, the subject 
 had experienced malaise and within the following month, he also experienced pyrexia and inhibitor 
 development. approximately 4 months later, the subject experienced iron deficiency anaemia. of note, 
 the underlying haemophilia, development of fviii inhibitors, and the difficulty in diagnosing fatigue in 
 this 1-year-old subject, were considered as confounders. furthermore, fatigue could be an early 
 symptom of iron deficiency anaemia that was later diagnosed. 
 throughout the clinical development program of rviii-singlechain, 1 additional event of fatigue has 
 been reported in a ptp. that was a non-serious event of mild severity that was assessed as not related 
 to rviii-singlechain by the investigator. 
 after medical review of this single event of fatigue with plausible other root cause, an update of the 
 smpc was not deemed necessary. 
 one subject experienced severe haemorrhage which was assessed as serious and related to 
 rviii
 ‑singlechain by the investigator. of note, the subject was tested positive for high titer fviii inhibitors (5.90 bu/ml) one week before the occurrence of haemorrhage. rviiisinglechain dose was 
 increased, rfvii (novoseven) was administered and the subject recovered from the event. csl 
 assessed this event as related to rviii-singlechain. the presence of fviii inhibitors was likely the main 
 cause of haemorrhage. haemorrhage itself is a clinical sign that allows for early suspicion and testing 
 for fviii inhibitors, as described in section 4.4 of the eu-smpc: 
 inhibitors the formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor viii is a known complication in the 
 management of individuals with haemophilia a. these inhibitors are usually igg immunoglobulins 
 directed against the factor viii procoagulant activity, which are quantified in bethesda units (bu) per</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p> 
 page 36/39</p><p>
 ml of plasma using the modified assay. the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor viii, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure 
 days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
 the clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
 posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
 in general, all patients treated with coagulation factor viii products should be carefully monitored for 
 the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. if the expected 
 factor viii activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
 dose, testing for factor viii inhibitor presence should be performed. in patients with high levels of 
 inhibitor, factor viii therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
 management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
 haemophilia and factor viii inhibitors. 
 therefore, after medical review of this single case of haemorrhage in the context of fviii inhibitors, an update of the afstyla smpc was not deemed necessary.</p></section><section><header>assessment of the mah’s responses</header><p>the applicant’s explanations are acknowledged.</p><p>point not further pursued.</p></section><section><header>question 10</header><p>three subjects discontinued the study as per physician’s decision. the applicant is asked to provide additional details for the underlying reason(s).</p></section><section><header>assessment of the mah’s responses</header><p>additional information provided for subjects’ discontinuation per physician’s decision do not raise concerns.</p><p>
