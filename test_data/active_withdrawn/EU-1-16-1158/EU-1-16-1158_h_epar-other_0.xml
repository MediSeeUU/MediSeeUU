 submission of study results of study 3001 which aimed at 
 investigating the safety and efficacy of afstyla in previously 
 treated (ptps) and previously untreated patients (pups) 
 with severe haemophilia a.
  for more information, please refer to the summary of 
 product characteristics. 
  1 notifications are issued for type i variations and article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type ii variation or extension application or a worksharing application). opinions are issued for all other procedures. 
 2 a commission decision (cd) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex ii, labelling, package leaflet). the cd is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of article 23.1a(a) of regulation (eu) no. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures. 
 3 smpc (summary of product characteristics), annex ii, labelling, pl (package leaflet).      page 2/10 mah took the opportunity to update the list of local
