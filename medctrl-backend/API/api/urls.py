# This file contains all routes (endpoints) that are accessible
# by a user. Each route connects to a 'view', which can be found
# in the 'views' folder. We distinguish between APIView's and ViewSets.
# In 'urlpatterns' paths are specified. APIView's use '.as_view()' as
# an additional argument where ViewSets use 'as_viewViewSet' as an additional
# argument. ViewSets can also be used in a router, APIView's can not.
