 the required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10 
 seconds.</p><p>
 a pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim 
 pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg in 0.9% sodium chloride solution only. tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim 
 pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is incompatible with dextrose solution.</p><p>
 no other medicinal product should be added to the injection solution.</p><p>
 adjunctive therapy 
 acetylsalicylic acid (asa) and heparin should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis to 
 inhibit the thrombogenic process.</p><p>
 asa should be administered as soon as possible after ami symptom onset and continued as long- 
 term treatment. the recommended initial oral dose is between 150 and 325 mg per day. if the patient 
 is unable to ingest tablets, an initial dose of 100-250 mg may be given intravenously if available. the 
 asa dosage during the following days will be at the discretion of the treating physician.</p><p>
 heparin should be administered as soon as possible after the diagnosis of ami has been confirmed, 
 and continued for at least 48 hours on a body weight adjusted basis. for patients weighing 67 kg or 
 less, an initial intravenous heparin bolus not exceeding 4,000 iu is recommended followed initially by 
 not more than an 800 iu/hour infusion. for patients weighing more than 67 kg, an initial intravenous 
 heparin bolus not exceeding 5,000 iu is recommended followed initially by not more than 1,000 
 iu/hour infusion. for patients already receiving heparin treatment, the initial bolus should not be 
 given. the infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain an aptt of 50-75 seconds (1.5 to 2.5 times 
 control or a heparin plasma level of 0.2 to 0.5 iu/ml).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is contraindicated in the following situations because thrombolytic therapy is associated with a higher risk of bleeding:</p><p>
 - significant bleeding disorder either at present or within the past 6 months - patients with current concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy (inr &gt; 1.3) - any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinal surgery)</p><p>
 - known haemorrhagic diathesis</p><p>- severe uncontrolled hypertension</p><p>- major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2 months - (this includes any trauma associated with the current ami) - recent trauma to the head or cranium - prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 2 minutes) within the past 2 weeks - acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis - acute pancreatitis</p><p>4 - severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis 
 - active peptic ulceration - arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation - neoplasm with increased bleeding risk - any known history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack or dementia - hypersensitivity to the active substance tenecteplase and to any of the excipients</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>bleeding the most common complication encountered during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma 
 gmbh &amp; co. kg therapy is bleeding. the concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute 
 to bleeding. as fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg 
 therapy, bleeding from recent puncture site may occur. therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires 
 careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous 
 puncture sites, cutdown sites and needle puncture sites). the use of rigid catheters as well as 
 intramuscular injections and non-essential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment 
 with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg.</p><p>
 most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival 
 bleeding were observed.</p><p>
 should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration 
 should be terminated immediately. administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has 
 been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. in the few patients who fail to respond 
 to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. transfusion of 
 cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory 
 reassessment after each administration. a target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with 
 cryoprecipitate infusion. antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. in the following 
 conditions, the risk of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg therapy may be 
 increased and should be weighed against anticipated benefits:</p><p>
 - systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm hg</p><p>- cerebrovascular disease - recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days) - high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation - any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection - advanced age, i.e. over 75 years - low body weight &lt; 60 kg</p><p>
 arrhythmias 
 coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. it is recommended that 
 antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator) 
 be available when tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is administered.</p><p>
 gpiib/iiia antagonists 
 there is no experience with the use of gpiib/iiia antagonists within the first 24 hours after start of 
 treatment.</p><p>
 re-administration 
 since at present there is no experience with re-administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim 
 pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg, the re-administration is not recommended. however, no antibody 
 formation to the tenecteplase molecule has been observed. if an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the 
 injection should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. in any case, 
 tenecteplase should not be re-administered before assessment of haemostatic factors like fibrinogen, 
 plasminogen and alpha2-antiplasmin.</p><p>5</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 
 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no formal interaction studies with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg and medicinal products commonly administered in patients with ami have been performed. however, the 
 analysis of data from more than 12,000 patients treated during phase i, ii and iii did not reveal any 
 clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used in patients with ami and 
 concomitantly used with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg.</p><p>
 medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine, 
 clopidogrel, lmwh) may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after tenecteplase 
 boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>no experience in pregnant women is available for tenecteplase. because animal studies (see also section 5.3.) have shown a high risk of vaginal bleeding presumably from the placenta and of 
 pregnancy loss, the benefit of treatment has to be evaluated against the potential risks which may 
 aggravate an acute life-threatening situation.</p><p>
 it is not known if tenecteplase is excreted into breast milk. breast milk should be discarded within the 
 first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>not applicable.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>haemorrhage is a very common undesirable effect associated with the use of tenecteplase. the type of haemorrhage is predominantly superficial at the injection site. ecchymoses are observed commonly

 mechanism of action 
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa 
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus 
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the 
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to 
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 α2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in 
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u, 
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.</p><p>
 clinical effects 
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.</p><p>7 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, 
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this 
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial 
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.</p><p>
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully 
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in 
 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase 
 distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma 
 proteins in humans.</p><p>
 after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
 tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of 
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean 
 +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and 
 plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.</p><p>
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age 
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.</p><p>
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans is not 
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with 
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal 
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and reversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which 
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity 
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
 anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.</p><p>8 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: l-arginine, phosphoric acid, polysorbate 20. solvent: water for injections</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2 incompatibilities</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is incompatible with dextrose infusion solutions.</p></section><section><header n="6.3">6.3 shelf life</header><p>shelf life as packaged for sale 2 years</p><p>

 mechanism of action 
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa 
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus 
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the 
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to 
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 α2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in 
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u, 
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.</p><p>
 clinical effects 
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.</p><p>15 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, 
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this 
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial 
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.</p><p>
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully 
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in 
 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase 
 distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma 
 proteins in humans.</p><p>
 after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
 tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of 
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean 
 +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and 
 plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.</p><p>
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age 
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.</p><p>
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase</p><p>in humans is not 
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with 
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal 
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and reversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which 
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity 
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
 anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.</p><p>16 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: l-arginine, phosphoric acid, polysorbate 20. solvent: water for injections</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2 incompatibilities</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is incompatible with dextrose infusion solutions.</p></section><section><header n="6.3">6.3 shelf life</header><p>shelf life as packaged for sale 2 years</p><p>

 pharmacodynamic effects 
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 α2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in 
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u, 
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.</p><p>
 clinical effects 
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.</p><p>23 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days,</p><p>
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this 
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial 
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.</p><p>
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully 
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in 
 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase 
 distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma 
 proteins in humans.</p><p>
 after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
 tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of 
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean 
 +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and 
 plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.</p><p>
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age 
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.</p><p>
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase</p><p>in humans is not 
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with 
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal 
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and reversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which 
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity 
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
 anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.</p><p>24 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: l-arginine, phosphoric acid, polysorbate 20. solvent: water for injections</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2 incompatibilities</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh &amp; co. kg is incompatible with dextrose infusion solutions.</p></section><section><header n="6.3">6.3 shelf life</header><p>shelf life as packaged for sale 2 years</p><p>
