 1.1. 
 introduction</header><p>pegintron (peginterferon alfa-2b) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic</p><p> hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for 
 serum hcv-rna or anti-hcv. pegintron is best used in combination with ribavirin. approximately 
 33% of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected patients are co-infected with hepatitis c 
 (hcv) in europe. this represents a serious public health issue that needs special attention, insofar as 
 hepatitis c infection in hcv-hiv coinfected individuals seems to have a more aggressive course. the 
 marketing authorisation holder (mah) of peginterferon alfa-2b is now submitting a variation to 
 introduce information in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the spc of rebetol (ribavirin) and 
 pegylated interferon alfa-2b based on the clinical experience gained in the hiv-hcv co-infected 
 patients.</p><p>
 two phase iii randomised open label studies, not sponsored by the mah, are submitted in support of 
 this variation:</p><p>

 p01017 or ribavic study independently conducted in france by the agence nationale de 
 recherches sur le sida (anrs) – study period: february</p><p>2000 to october</p><p>2003,</p><p>
 - p02080 a smaller investigator initiated study conducted in spain- study period: april 2001 to february 2004.</p><p> 
 both studies aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of the standard interferon alfa-2b to the 
 pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin combination in hiv-hcv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header n="1.2">1.2.     clinical efficacy</header><p>the main differences in studies p01017 and p02080 are outlined below followed by a description of the studies:</p></section><section><header>design      title</header><p>ribavic p01017:</p><p>a randomised controlled trial of pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin

 rates of svr between the 2 treatment groups were similar; 53% in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin 
 arm versus 47% in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin arm. few subjects were infected with genotype 4 
 (n=4, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin; n=9, interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin) and of those 13 subjects, only 1 
 had a svr</p><p>
 baseline hcv viral load:</p><p>a higher percentage of subjects with low baseline levels of hcv rna (&lt;800,000 iu/ml) reached svr in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment group (59%) compared with the interferon alfa-2b

 intron a/ribavirin (29%, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin; 15%, interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin).</p><p>
 liver fibrosis score: the extent of liver fibrosis also affected response rate; more subjects with low fibrosis grades (0 to 2) achieved svr in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm (49%) compared with the interferon 
 alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm (21%). response rates in subjects with advanced fibrosis (grades 3 to 
 4) were slightly higher in subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin versus interferon alfa-2b 
 /ribavirin (33%, peginterferon alfa-2b /ribavirin; 23%, interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin).</p><p>hiv variables: forty-eight percent of subjects with high cd4
 + cell count (&gt;560 x 106 cells/mm3) and in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin group achieved svr compared with 20% in the interferon alfa-2b 
 /ribavirin treatment group. the benefit of peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin versus interferon alfa-2b 
 /ribavirin can also be observed in subjects with lower cd4
 + counts at baseline (40%, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin; 22%, interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin). as expected, response rates based on baseline 
 hiv viral load (≤200 copies/ml versus &gt;200 copies/ml) trended in the same direction as baseline cd4
 +</p><p>counts. those subjects with low baseline hiv viral load did slightly better than those with higher viral loads and those treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin had better response rates than those treated 
 with interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin.</p><p>
 age and gender:</p><p>all subjects were between 30 and 59 years old (median = 40 years old). response rates were consistently higher for peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin versus introna/ribavirin, regardless of age. 
 there were more male subjects in the study and the response rate in that subgroup was lower than in 
 female subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm; however, regardless of gender, 
 peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin-treated subjects had higher svr than did interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin-
 treated subjects.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>sustained virologic response rates</p><p>in the ribavic study the results observed in the pegylated arm were quite low as compared to the results achieved in the laguno</p><p>and</p><p>pegasys</p><p>study as well as in the tested hypothesis. these results 
 are mainly driven by the poor response observed in genotype 1 and 4 (17%), that is less than what is 
 observed in the laguno study (38%). in the apricot study with pegasys, svr in genotype 1 was 
 29%.</p><p>
 overall, given that the population enrolled in the ribavic and laguno studies were very similar it is 
 difficult to draw a formal explanation as to the differences in</p><p>svr that are only</p><p>observed in</p><p>the 
 pegylated-interferon alfa-2b arm. it can be questioned however whether the lower than expected 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 9efficacy with peginterferon alfa-2b in the ribavic study might not reflect some over-compensation in dose reduction in order to manage the high rate of haematological adverse events observed.</p><p>the chmp requested a comparison between the ribavic and laguno studies with regards to dose 
 reduction and discontinuation due to haematological adverse reactions in order to be able to conclude 
 whether a difference in the treatment discontinuation due to anaemia and neutropenia could explain 
 the difference in the response rate in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm between both studies. in this field 
 the chmp also requested the mah to provide an analysis of the use of growth factors to manage 
 haematological adverse events (aes) in each of the studies.</p><p> the use of erythropoietin (epo) was not allowed in the spanish study and was minimal in the anrs 
 study. the use of other growth factors than epo in the anrs study pertained to approximately 13% 
 of patients with neutropenia (15% in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 10% in the introna arm). the 
 chmp decided that no conclusion could be drawn based on such limited data.</p><p>the proportion of patients with dose reduction of ribavirin (in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm) for 
 anaemia and the proportion of patients with dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b for neutropenia 
 were both higher in the laguno study compared to the ribavic study. moreover, the number of 
 discontinuations due to anaemia or neutropenia in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm was similar in both 
 studies.</p><p>in view of the large difference in the svr rate observed in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm in 
 the ribavic study as compared to the laguno study, which is surprisingly not observed for the 
 introna arm, the only reason that could explain this difference would have been a difference in the 
 incidence of neutropenia (which is expected to only impact the peginterferon alfa-2b arm). however, 
 the incidence of neutropenia reported in</p><p>the laguno study</p><p>was higher, which argues against this 
 hypothesis.</p><p>the mah suggests that a</p><p>higher ribavirin dose and closer patient management in the 
 laguno study explain the difference in the svr rate observed in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm in the 
 ribavic study, however these factors would have been expected to impact both</p><p>peginterferon alfa-
 2b/rbv and standard interferon/rbv arms and so cannot explain the difference.</p><p>overall, the mechanism behind the lower svr rate reported in the peginterferon alfa-2b/rbv arm in 
 the ribavic study as compared to the laguno study remains unclear.</p><p>weight based ribavirin dose</p><p>the chmp</p><p>noted that the mah makes a recommendation using the treatment duration of the pivotal ribavic study and the ribavirin dose close to the laguno study (in line with the recommended 
 weight based dose in monoinfected patients). nevertheless, these recommendations are reasonable 
 insofar as 48 weeks treatment duration may be required to achieve hcv viral clearance. whilst the 
 chmp agreed to the 48 week treatment duration, the committee noted that current discussions within 
 the scientific community tend to favour 24 weeks treatment duration of hiv/hcv co-infected patients 
 with genotype 2/3 as for monoinfected patients, provided that they achieve undetectability at week 4. 
 therefore the chmp agreed that this issue will be further discussed by the mah in the frame of a 
 follow up measure.</p><p>in order to ensure a positive benefit/risk ratio of the partially tested recommendation with regards to 
 the ribavirin dose the mah was requested to propose a modelisation to appreciate whether the gain in 
 efficacy is not outweighed by the deterioration of the safety profile (anaemia). 
 the modelling approach used by the mah included a smoothed plot of svr rates by ribavirin dose 
 expressed as mg/kg, and logistic regression analysis. this approach was considered as acceptable by 
 the chmp. based on the modelling provided, a trend towards a well-balanced gain in efficacy versus 
 loss in safety (anaemia) was observed (e.g. as compared to the group receiving &lt;10.6mg/kg rbv, 
 patients receiving &gt;13.3mg/kg rbv showed increase in svr rate: +16% and increase in anaemia 
 occurrence: +20%). therefore, a favourable benefit-risk ratio of the weight-base ribavirin dose in</p><p> 
 co-infected patients is expected. furthermore, from an efficacy point of view the recommendation of a 
 weight-based ribavirin is considered as a conservative measure in this particularly difficult-to-treat 
 population.</p><p>this approach is also in line with the current european consensus conference on 
 hiv/hcv co-infection. overall, the mah’s proposal to recommend a weight-based dose of ribavirin 
 for co-infected patients, as for monoinfected, is supported by the chmp.</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 10 histological response the chmp noted that only 51% of biopsies were obtained from patients enrolled in the p01017 study. although it is acknowledged that to some extent obtaining 51% of the biopsies might well have been 
 challenging, it remains that the lack of histological data for approximately half of the population 
 enrolled is unfortunate for a reliable interpretation of the histological data. the mah was requested to 
 further address this issue in order to specify to what extent the population with biopsies is 
 representative of the overall population. based on a comparison of demographic and clinical 
 characteristics of subjects who did and did not undergo biopsy (carrat 
 et al1), it was found that overall, subjects differed only with respect to the mean fibrosis score. categorical analysis of the metavir 
 fibrosis score, although not significant, showed that the mean difference was mainly due to a 
 difference in the proportions of scores f2 and f3. more subjects who underwent biopsy scored f3 
 (29%) and fewer scored f2 (36%) compared to subjects who did not undergo biopsy (f3 17%; f2 
 42%). it is noteworthy that the frequency of cirrhosis (f4) was similar between the groups.</p><p>
 in order to evaluate the bias that may have resulted from this imbalance, anrs carried out a subgroup 
 analysis of histological follow up data according to the fibrosis score (f2 or f3)</p><p>(carrat 
 et al2). the analysis showed more severe progression of fibrosis in nonresponders with f3 than in those with f2. 
 this result was expected, as progression of liver disease accelerates with time, and longer follow up 
 would no doubt have led to similar conclusion in f2 subjects. however, the patterns of improvement 
 in activity in responders were similar.</p><p>
 the chmp concluded that extrapolation of the histological response observed in the 51% of patients 
 with available biopsy to the overall population is acceptable.</p><p> predictive values of an early virologic response</p><p>the chmp consider that information on positive and negative predictive value is important. therefore, inclusion of data on the predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-
 infected patients in the spc is supported. although not denying the interest of the predictability based 
 on early response at week 4, the predictability based on the early virological response at week 12 
 should indeed be preferred for inclusion in the spc at this time since more robust data are available as 
 regards the predictive value of week 12 data (also derived from monoinfected patients).</p></section><section><header n="1.3">1.3.    safety results  study p01017

 neutrophils 15% and 4% of patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b group had a grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia compared to 9% and 2% respectively in the introna group. 7% of peginterferon alfa-2b -treated

 of the patients had a full recovery (one patient with neuropathy had stable disease and one patient died 
 15 months later from liver failure despite a sustained hcv virological response). 
 according to univariate analysis, the intake of didanosine is the only factor significantly associated 
 with an increased risk of symptomatic mitochondrial toxicity. multivariate analysis showed that

 remaining seven cases (i.e 3 in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 4 in the introna arm), 5 also had 
 cirrhosis. all the patients were receiving antiretroviral treatment at the onset of decompensation 
 (didanosine in 5 cases, stavudine in 4 cases, lamivudine in 2 cases, abacavir in one case, nelfinavir in 4 
 cases, efavirenz in one case and ritonavir/saquinavir in one case). five patients died as a result of 
 hepatic decompensation (all 3 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 2 patients in the introna 
 arm). there was also a sixth fatal case as a result of hepatic decompensation but the treatment received 
 by the patient (peginterferon alfa-2b or introna) was not specified.

 single-center study with close monitoring and more robust adverse event reporting. however, the 
 safety profile of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy in hiv-hcv co-infected patients is 
 overall similar between the two studies in terms of adverse events reported.</p><p>in line with the results of ribavic study, in the laguno study there were more flu-like symptoms in

 mitochondrial toxicities one of the main safety concerns of the co-administration of antiretroviral</p><p>treatment and hcv therapies is the risk of overlapping mitochondrial toxicities of both nucleosidic agents. the data 
 derived from these studies confirm that the co-administration of didanosine and ribavirin is associated 
 with a higher risk of mitochondrial toxicity and thus that this combination should not be recommended 
 in clinical</p><p>practice. the current rebetol spc adequately mentions the risk of mitochondrial toxicity in 
 case of co-administration of didanosine or stavudine with ribavirin. the mah should continue to 
 closely monitor mitochondrial toxicity in co-infected patients receiving both anti-hiv and anti-hcv 
 therapies.</p><p>
 bani-sadr 
 et al. found that concomitant treatment of zidovudine with anti-hcv therapy was associated with an adjusted 3.3-fold higher risk of anaemia (or=3.27, p=0.0008). this is in line with 
 the apricot trial, where 50% of zidovudine treated patients had moderate to severe anaemia, 
 compared to 20% in other patients (torriani</p><p>et al). consequently, bani-sadr et al. recommend discontinuing zidovudine prior to hcv therapy in order to avoid anaemia and permit the use of higher 
 ribavirin doses. in the spc of rebetol there is currently a mention that “patients treated with rebetol 
 and interferon/peginterferon alfa-2b combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of 
 developing anaemia”. however, as the data provided by bani-sadr 
 et al. lead to the conclusion that zidovudine discontinuation could help to avoid anaemia associated with anti-hcv therapy, it is</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised 16mandatory to discuss the need for adopting a stronger warning. the mah will therefore discuss this issue as part of a forthcoming fum.</p><p>
 in line with clinical guidelines for hiv/hcv co-infection, the mah suggests zidovudine should</p><p>be 
 excluded prior to hcv treatment to solve the</p><p>problem of anaemia. however in one publication 
 (réndon</p><p>et al.) dealing with this issue (anaemia by weight based ribavirin dosage in hiv co-infected patients) it was found that patients treated with concomitant zidovudine had a significantly higher 
 ribavirin plasma-concentration at week 4. this finding is potentially important from a clinical point of 
 view. the mah has committed to discuss this finding, as this could imply that concomitant 
 zidovudine (with a possibly lower dose of ribavirin in case of anaemia) is not a problem from an 
 efficacy point of view.</p><p>
 finally some published data by rodriguez-torres m.</p><p>et al. lead to question the clinical relevance of the 
 in vitro inhibition of the zidovudine and stavudine phosphorylation by ribavirin. the mah has committed to further discuss this issue.</p><p> hepatic decompensation</p><p>
 the risk of hepatic decompensation in co-infected patients with cirrhosis treated with anti-hiv and anti-hcv therapies is already known. overall, there were six deaths reported due to hepatic 
 decompensation in the ribavic study and during its follow-up period. of note, a total of six deaths 
 (n=859) was reported in the study supporting the extension of indication of pegasys in co-infected 
 patients (study nr15961). the spc’s of rebetol/peginterferon alfa-2b already mention the risk of 
 hepatic decompensation when anti-hcv treatment is added to antiretroviral treatment in co-infected 
 patient as follows: “co-infected patient with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increase 
 risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferon alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset”. factors other than cirrhosis 
 that have found to be associated with hepatic decompensation are elevated bilirubin and didanosine 
 treatment. these have also been included in the spc. furthermore, recommendations for the 
 management of co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral and anti-hepatitis treatment have 
 been included in the spc. prescribers are advised that the child-pugh score should be monitored 
 during treatment and patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis 
 treatment immediately discontinued and the antiretroviral treatment reassessed.</p><p>the mah has identified cirrhosis and didanosine intake as independent risk factors of spontaneous 
 hepatic decompensation in co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral drugs and hcv therapy. 
 this reinforces the importance of the existing warning against the co-administration of didanosine and 
 ribavirin that appears all the more warranted in hiv-hcv co-infected patients with history of 
 cirrhosis.</p><p>finally, the chmp consider that initiation of treatment with interferon alfa-2b in co-infected patients 
 with cirrhosis with child-pugh &gt; 6 is contraindicated.</p></section><section><header n="1.4">1.4.   risk management</header><p>the chmp agreed that an eu - risk management plan would not be required for the extension of indication in the hiv/hcv co-infected target population.</p></section><section><header n="1.5">1.5.   overall discussion and benefit risk assessment</header><p>overall the mah used two independently conducted studies to support this type ii variation.</p><p>- 
 one pivotal multicenter study conducted by the anrs in a large sample size (ribavic 
 /p01017) 
 - 
 one smaller investigator initiated performed in a single centre in spain (laguno/ p02080).</p><p>
 whereas both studies are very similar as regards the population enrolled (in terms of immuno-
 virologic parameters, hiv and hcv history, distribution of hcv genotype) they differ on the 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 17ribavirin dose and on the treatment duration; whereas the ribavirin dose in the p02080 was in line with that recommended in monoinfected patients, a 800 mg non weight based dose was selected in the 
 p01017 study. moreover, whereas 24 weeks treatment duration is now recommended in monoinfected 
 genotype 2/3 the ribavic study tested 48 weeks treatment duration regardless of genotype or viral 
 load.</p><p>as a significant limitation of these studies, their results could not be extrapolated to hiv</p><p> 
 co-infected patients with low cd4
 + (&lt;200/mm3) and high viral load. such a difficult-to-treat population is nevertheless critical in clinical practice. the mah has proposed a warning for the spc 
 on the limited data available in hiv-hcv co-infected patients with cd4
 + &lt;200/mm3.</p><p>
 the mah makes a recommendation using on one hand the treatment duration of the pivotal ribavic 
 study and on the other the ribavirin dose similar</p><p>to the laguno study (in line with the recommended 
 weight based dose in monoinfected patients). the chmp agreed that 48 weeks treatment duration was 
 reasonable and may be required to achieve hcv viral clearance. however the mah will further 
 discuss the possibility of recommending 24 weeks treatment in hiv/hcv co-infected patients with 
 genotype 2/3 provided that they achieve undetectability at week 4. this reflects current discussions in 
 the scientific community that favour 24 weeks duration in genotype 2/3 patients. 
 the chmp had concerns regarding the partially tested recommendation regarding the weight based 
 ribavirin dose. a modelling provided by the mah showed a trend towards a well balanced gain in 
 efficacy versus loss in safety. furthermore from an efficacy point of view the recommendation of 
 weight based ribavirin is considered a conservative measure in this difficult to treat population. 
 therefore a favourable benefit risk balance is expected in this population.</p><p>
 in the ribavic study the results observed in genotype 1 and 4 in the pegylated arm were quite low 
 (17%), as compared to the results achieved in the laguno study (38%) and the tested hypothesis. this 
 should also be seen in light of the apricot study with pegasys (svr in genotype 1 in apricot</p><p>was 29%). the difference in svr rate was surprisingly not observed for the introna arm. the only 
 reason that could explain this difference would have been a difference in the incidence of neutropenia 
 (which is expected to only impact the peginterferon alfa-2b arm). however, the incidence of 
 neutropenia as reported in the laguno study was higher than in the ribavic study, which argues 
 against this hypothesis. other factors that could explain the difference in the svr rate observed 
 included a</p><p>higher ribavirin dose and closer patient management in the laguno study, however these 
 factors would have been expected to impact both peginterferon alfa-2b/rbv and standard 
 interferon/rbv</p><p>and so cannot explain the difference observed. as the use of erythropoietin was not 
 allowed in the spanish study and was minimal in the anrs study, no conclusion on the impact of the 
 use of epo on the results could be made. overall this issue remains unclear. 
 the main safety concerns of the co-administration of antiretroviral and hcv therapies are the risk of 
 overlapping mitochondrial toxicities of both nucleosidic agents. the mah has been requested to 
 closely monitor mitochondrial toxicity in co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral and anti-
 hcv therapy. the spc of rebetol adequately mentions the risk of mitochondrial toxicity in case of 
 co-administration of didanosine or stavudine. however, the mah has been requested to further 
 discuss the need to reinforce the warning pertaining to the higher risk of anaemia in case of co-
 administration of zidovudine and ribavirin in the frame of a follow up measure in view of the 
 publication by</p><p>bani-sadr 
 et al. who found that concomitant treatment of zidovudine with anti-hcv therapy was associated with an adjusted 3.3-fold higher risk of anaemia. 
 although the mah suggests excluding zidovudine prior to hcv treatment in order to solve the 
 problem of anaemia, réndon</p><p>et al. found that patients with concomitant zidovudine had a significantly 
 higher ribavirin plasma-concentration at week 4. this could imply that concomitant zidovudine (with a 
 possibly lower dose of ribavirin in case of anaemia) is not a problem from an efficacy point of view. 
 the mah has committed to review this issue.</p><p>the second main safety concern of the co-administration of antiretroviral treatment and hcv 
 therapies is the potential risk of hepatic decompensation. overall, there were six deaths reported due to 
 hepatic decompensation in the ribavic study and during its follow-up period. the spc of 
 rebetol/peginterferon alfa-2b already mentions the risk of hepatic decompensation when anti-hcv 
 treatment is added to antiretroviral treatment in co-infected patient. however the data submitted show 
 that factors other than cirrhosis are associated with a hepatic decompensation. these include elevated 
 medicinal product no longer authorised 18bilirubin and concomitant didanosine. this has been reflected in section 4.4 of the spc along with a warning to prescribers to closely monitor patients child-pugh score and to discontinue treatment for 
 hcv in patients progressing to hepatic decompensation 
 overall the chmp considered that the benefit risk balance for pegintron in the treatment of hcv in 
 patients co-infected with hiv is positive. the modelling provided by the mah to substantiate the 
 benefit risk balance of the partially tested recommendation of higher ribavirin dose for coinfected 
 patients provides reassurance of a favourable benefit/risk balance of the weight-based dose of ribavirin 
 in the coinfected patient. furthermore this recommendation is considered a conservative measure on 
 an efficacy point of view, in this particularly difficult-to-treat population. with regards to the agreed 
 48 weeks treatment duration it is recognised that</p><p>there are current discussions within the scientific 
 community that tend to favour</p><p>24 weeks of treatment for genotype 2/3 patients, provided that they 
 achieve undectability at week 4.</p><p>this will be further discussed by the mah in the frame of a follow 
 up measure. the main safety concerns of the co-administration of antiretroviral treatment and hcv 
 therapies is the risk of overlapping mitochondrial toxicities of both nucleosidic agents and</p><p>the 
 potential risk of hepatic decompensation when antiretroviral treatment and hcv therapies are co-
 administered. this is reflected in the spc. this extension of indication will lead to further discussion 
 on the co-administration of nrtis and ribavirin.</p><p>medicinal product no longer authorised 19</p></section><section><header>vii.      references</header><p>1. carrat f, bani-sadr f, pol s et al. pegylated interferon alfa-2b versus standard interferon alfa-
