 4.1
 therapeutic indications</header><p>adults (tritherapy)pegintron in combination with ribavirin and boceprevir (tritherapy) is indicated for the treatment of</p><p>3chronic hepatitis c (chc) genotype 1 infection in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with compensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy (see 
 section 5.1).
 please refer to the ribavirin and boceprevir summary of product characteristics (smpcs) when 
 pegintron is to be used in combination with these medicines.
 adults (bitherapy and monotherapy)
 pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (18 years of age and older) with chc who are 
 positive for hepatitis c virus rna (hcv-rna), including patients with compensated cirrhosis and/or 
 co-infected with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4).
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy) is indicated for the treatment of chc infection in 
 adult patients who are previously untreated including patients with clinically stable hiv co-infection 
 and in adult patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.
 please refer to the ribavirin smpc when pegintron is to be used in combination with ribavirin. 
 paediatric population (bitherapy)
 pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of 
 age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, previously untreated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. the decision to treat 
 should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).
 please refer to the ribavirin smpc for capsules or oral solution when pegintron is to be used in 
 combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c.
 posology
 pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administered in 
 adults depends on whether it is used in combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy) or as 
 monotherapy.
 pegintron combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy)bitherapy (pegintron with ribavirin): 
 applies to all adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age and older.

 adults - duration of treatment – naïve patientstritherapy: 
 refer to the smpc for boceprevir.bitherapy: predictability of sustained virological response - patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve undetectable hcv-rna or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 
 or 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also section 5.1).
 genotype 1: - patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). 
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment 
 duration (see section 5.1).
 genotypes 2 or 3: it is recommended that all patients be treated with bitherapy for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv 
 co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.
 genotype 4: in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment with bitherapy as for 
 genotype 1.
 adults - duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infectionbitherapy: 
 the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks with bitherapy, regardless of genotype.
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection - early virological response by 
 week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown 
 to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for sustained response in 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was 99 % (67/68;</p><p>5study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; study 1) was observed for hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving bitherapy.
 adults - duration of treatment - retreatmenttritherapy: 
 refer to the smpc for boceprevir.bitherapy: predictability of sustained virological response - all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 
 48 weeks of bitherapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna 
 below the limits of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 
 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
 retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been 
 studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy. 
 paediatric population (bitherapy only) – dose to be administereddosing for children 3 years of age and older and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 
 60</p><p>g/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).
 paediatric population (bitherapy only) - duration of treatment genotype 1: the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical 
 data on combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive 
 value 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.
 genotype 2 or 3: the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 24 weeks.
 genotype 4: only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. it is recommended that 
 children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued 
 from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.
 pegintron monotherapy – adultsdose to be administered
 as monotherapy the pegintron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg/week. the lowest pegintron strength available is 50</p><p>g/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 g/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. for the 1.0 g/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate strengths can be used as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. pegintron monotherapy was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p></section><section><header>table 2monotherapy dosing

 ** for patients &gt; 120 kg, the pegintron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight. this may require 
 combinations of various pegintron dose strengths and volumes.
 duration of treatmentfor patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months). the decision to extend therapy to one year of 
 treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging 
 fibrosis).
 dose modification for all patients (monotherapy and combination therapy)if severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with pegintron monotherapy or combination therapy, the dosages of pegintron and/or ribavirin must be modified as 
 appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. dose reduction of boceprevir is not recommended. 
 boceprevir must not be administered in the absence of pegintron and ribavirin.
 as adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose of pegintron and ribavirin should 
 be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose. guidelines were developed in clinical 
 trials for dose modification.

 pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued. 
 combination therapypatients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin smpc). when administered in combination therapy</p></section><section><header>,</header><p> patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
 hepatic impairmentthe safety and efficacy of pegintron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore pegintron must not be used for these patients.
 elderly ( 65 years of age)there are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of pegintron. data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of pegintron suggest no alteration in pegintron dose is necessary based on age 
 (see section 5.2).
 paediatric populationpegintron can be used in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients 3 years of age and older. method of administration
 pegintron should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. for special handling information see 
 section 6.6. patients may self-inject pegintron if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with

 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, 
 and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditionsif treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after 
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events 
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).
 patients with substance use/abusehcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, 
 the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents)</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common. long-term data available in children treated with the 
 combination therapy of pegylated interferon/ribavirin are indicative of substantial growth retardation. 
 thirty two percent (30/94) of subjects demonstrated &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height-for-age 
 percentile 5 years after completion of therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, that resulted in reduced height in some patients.</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. although data are limited, no evidence of long-term effects on sexual 
 maturation was noted in the 5-year observational follow-up study.</p><p>11more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are 
 generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have 
 occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.
 acute hypersensitivity
 acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have 
 been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with 
 pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes 
 do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
 cardiovascular system
 as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction 
 and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require close monitoring. it 
 is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken 
 prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually 
 respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron therapy. there are no data 
 in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.
 hepatic failure
 pegintron increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. as with all 
 interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. liver enzymes and hepatic function should be 
 closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.
 pyrexia
 while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon 
 therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.
 hydration
 adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension 
 related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. fluid 
 replacement may be necessary.
 pulmonary changes
 pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed 
 rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other 
 respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or 
 there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if 
 appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and 
 treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
 autoimmune disease
 the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment 
 with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at 
 increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be 
 evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also 
 section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8).
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).</p><p>12ocular changesophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, serous retinal detachment, 
 and retinal artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient 
 complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and 
 complete eye examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, 
 particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or 
 hypertension. discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or 
 worsening ophthalmological disorders.
 thyroid changes
 infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed 
 thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of children 
 treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating 
 hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. 
 prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality 
 detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, during the 
 course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the 
 presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be 
 maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be monitored every 
 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).
 metabolic disturbances
 hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. 
 monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
 hcv/hiv co-infection
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosispatients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may beat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin smpc). 
 hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosisco-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patientshcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8). 
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).
 patients with low cd4 countsin patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of</p><p>13patients with low cd4 counts.please refer to the respective smpcs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken 
 concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product 
 and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and ribavirin.
 hcv/hbv coinfection
 cases of hepatitis b re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-
 infected with hepatitis b and c viruses treated with interferon. the frequency of such re-activation 
 appears to be low.
 all patients should be screened for hepatitis b before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis c; 
 patients co-infected with hepatitis b and c must then be monitored and managed according to current 
 clinical guidelines.
 dental and periodontal disorders
 dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients 
 receiving pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging 
 effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination 
 of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular 
 dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. if this reaction occurs, they 
 should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
 organ transplant recipients
 the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of 
 hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. preliminary data indicate 
 that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. liver 
 graft rejection has also been reported.
 other
 due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of 
 pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.
 laboratory tests
 standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all 
 patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior 
 to initiation of pegintron therapy are:
 platelets 100,000/mm3neutrophil count 1,500/mm3tsh levelmust be within normal limits
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).
 long term maintenance monotherapy
 it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not 
 effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant effect on the 
 time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death 
 and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. pegintron should 
 therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.

 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</p><p>14this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>interaction studies have only been performed in adults.telbivudine
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine smpc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).
 methadone
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p></section><section><header>effect of peginterferon alfa-2b on co-administered medicines</header><p>the potential interaction of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes was evaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. in these studies, the effects of 
 multiple-dose regimens of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) were investigated in hepatitis c subjects 
 (1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week) (</p></section><section><header>table 4</header><p>). a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) and 
 tolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon 
 alfa-2b (pegintron) is administered with medicines metabolized by cyp2c9, cyp3a4 and 
 n-acetyltransferase. concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) with caffeine or 
 desipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. when patients are 
 administered pegintron with medications metabolized by cyp1a2 or cyp2d6, the extent of the 
 decrease in cytochrome p 450 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with medicines 
 which have a narrow therapeutic margin (</p></section><section><header>table 5</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>table 4effect of peginterferon alfa-2b on co-administered medicinesco-administered

 hcv/hiv co-infection</p></section><section><header>nucleoside analogues</header><p>use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides 
 in vitro
 . this activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. 
 reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, 
 have been reported (see ribavirin smpc).
 exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen 
 used to treat hiv, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. the concomitant use of 
 ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
 consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment 
 (art) regimen if this is already established. this would be particularly important in patients with a 
 known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.</p></section><section><header>4.6fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and femalespegintron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception 
 during the treatment.
 combination therapy with ribavirinextreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking pegintron in combination with ribavirin. females of childbearing potential must use an effective 
 contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. male patients or their 
 female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has 
 been concluded (see ribavirin smpc).
 pregnancy
 there are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. 
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</p><p>17combination therapy with ribavirinribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

 the most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with pegintron in combination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue, 
 headache, and injection site reaction. additional adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of 
 subjects included nausea, chills, insomnia, anaemia, pyrexia, myalgia, asthenia, pain, alopecia, 
 anorexia, weight decreased, depression, rash and irritability. the most frequently reported adverse 
 reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for 
 modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy. fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia,

 *these adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy.#class label for interferon products, see below pulmonary arterial hypertension.description of selected adverse reactions in adultsmost cases of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in combination 
 with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4). 
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease. 
 cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) have been reported with interferon alfa products, 
 notably in patients with risk factors for pah (such as portal hypertension, hiv-infection, cirrhosis). 
 events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with 
 interferon alfa.
 ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies 
 (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, 
 loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated),
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients
 summary of the safety profilefor hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the 
 larger studies with a frequency &gt; 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), 
 cd4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
 (9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic 
 hepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).
 description of selected adverse reactionsmitochondrial toxicity
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patientsalthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin
 . in study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm
 3 was observed in 4 %</p><p>21(8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin. anaemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9.4 g/dl) was 
 reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.
 cd4 lymphocytes decreasetreatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).
 please refer to the respective smpcs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken 
 concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and 
 the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.
 paediatric population
 summary of the safety profilein a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). weight 
 loss and growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean 
 decrease from baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, 
 respectively) and growth velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height 
 percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). ninety-four of 107 subjects enrolled in the 5 year long-term follow-up trial. the effects on growth were less in those subjects 
 treated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. from pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-
 up among subjects treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 
 9.0 percentiles, respectively. twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of 
 subjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a &gt; 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment 
 to the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentile. eleven 
 percent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were 
 observed to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of &gt; 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end 
 of the 5 year long-term follow-up. for weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-
 for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, 
 respectively. for bmi, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, bmi-for-age percentiles 
 decreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively.
 decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up was most prominent in 
 prepubertal age children. the decline of height, weight and bmi z scores observed during the 
 treatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term 
 follow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). 
 in the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia 
 (80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema 
 (29 %). only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the 
 majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse 
 reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in 
 extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent 
 adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger 
 (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine

 §class effect of interferon-alfa containing products – reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric patients; with pegintron reported in adult patients.
 description of selected adverse reactions in children and adolescentsmost of the changes in laboratory values in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or moderate. decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin 
 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it allows 
 continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare professionals are 
 asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 
 appendix v

 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic</p><p>24treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, interferons, atc code: l03ab10.recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
 mechanism of action
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement 
 of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of 
 lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.
 pharmacodynamic effects
 pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining 
 changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.
 clinical efficacy and safety – adults
 tritherapy with pegintron, ribavirin and boceprevirrefer to the smpc for boceprevir.monotherapy with pegintron and bitherapy with pegintron and ribavirinnaïve patients
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.</p><p>25in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 8</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens:
 -
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).
 -
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 -
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 8</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 9</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
  10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 9</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.</p></section><section><header>table 8sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 . 14 %, for dose modification 18 % vs. 49 %.in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48).
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two 
 pegintron/ribavirin regimens [pegintron 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in 
 combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and peginterferon alfa-

 * (hcv-rna pcr assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 iu/ml)lack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable hcv-rna with a &lt; 2 log
 10 reduction from baseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment.
 in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %. 
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients: virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna. virological response 
 by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna. these 
 time points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have been shown to be predictive for sustained 
 response (</p></section><section><header>table 12</header><p>).</p></section><section><header>table 12predictive value of in-treatment virologic response while on pegintron

 *intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.</p><p>31overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively. among 480 patients with &gt; 2 log viral 
 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %. 
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
 long-term efficacy data-adultsa large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained 
 responders relapsed during the study.
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
 clinical efficacy and safety – paediatric population

 hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus 
 pegintron 60</p><p>g/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on hcv genotype and baseline viral load. all patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. a total of 107 patients received

 .long-term efficacy data - paediatric populationa five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis c patients after treatment in a multicentre trial. of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. the 
 purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (svr) and

 follow-up.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay. 
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.
 renal impairment
 renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study 
 (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron 
 for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
 sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy or tritherapy) (see section 4.3).
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)
 hepatic impairment
 the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic 
 dysfunction.
 elderly (
  65 years of age)the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were 
 not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron dosage is necessary based on 
 advancing age.
 paediatric population
 multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules and oral solution) in 
 children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated during a clinical study.</p><p>33in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of pegintron at 60</p><p>g/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5</p><p>g/kg/week.interferon neutralising factors
 interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron 
 in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of 
 interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received 
 pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.
 transfer into seminal fluid
 seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is 
 approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female 
 partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely 
 limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintronadverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these 
 studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays.pegintron plus ribavirin
 when used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with 
 either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate 
 anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol smpc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars

 therapeutic indications</header><p>adults (tritherapy)pegintron in combination with ribavirin and boceprevir (tritherapy) is indicated for the treatment of 
 chronic hepatitis c (chc) genotype 1 infection in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with 
 compensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy (see 
 section 5.1).
 please refer to the ribavirin and boceprevir summary of product characteristics (smpcs) when 
 pegintron is to be used in combination with these medicines.
 adults (bitherapy and monotherapy)
 pegintron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (18 years of age and older) with chc who are 
 positive for hepatitis c virus rna (hcv-rna), including patients with compensated cirrhosis and/or 
 co-infected with clinically stable hiv (see section 4.4). 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy) is indicated for the treatment of chc infection in 
 adult patients who are previously untreated including patients with clinically stable hiv co-infection 
 and in adult patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1). 
 interferon monotherapy, including pegintron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or 
 contraindication to ribavirin.
 please refer to the ribavirin smpc when pegintron is to be used in combination with ribavirin. 
 paediatric population (bitherapy)
 pegintron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of 
 age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis c, previously untreated, without liver 
 decompensation, and who are positive for hcv-rna.
 when deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination 
 therapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. the decision to treat 
 should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).
 please refer to the ribavirin smpc for capsules or oral solution when pegintron is to be used in 
 combination with ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis c.
 posology
 pegintron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. the dose administered in 
 adults depends on whether it is used in combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy) or as 
 monotherapy.
 pegintron combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy)bitherapy (pegintron with ribavirin): 
 applies to all adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age and older.
 tritherapy (pegintron with ribavirin and boceprevir): applies to adult patients with genotype 1 chc. 39adults – dose to be administeredpegintron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.the intended dose of 1.5 µg/kg of pegintron to be used in combination with ribavirin may be

 adults - duration of treatment – naïve patientstritherapy:</p><p>refer to the smpc for boceprevir.bitherapy: predictability of sustained virological response - patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve undetectable hcv-rna or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 
 or 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for 
 discontinuation (see also section 5.1).
 genotype 1: - patients who have undetectable hcv-rna at treatment week 12, treatment should be 
 continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). 
 - patients with detectable but ≥ 2 log decrease in hcv-rna level from baseline at treatment 
 week 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if hcv-rna is undetectable, they 
 should continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). however, if hcv-rna is 
 still detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.
 - in the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) who 
 become hcv-rna negative at treatment week 4 and remain hcv-rna negative at week 24, 
 the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an 
 additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). however, an overall 24 weeks 
 treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment 
 duration (see section 5.1).
 genotypes 2 or 3: it is recommended that all patients be treated with bitherapy for 24 weeks, except for hcv/hiv 
 co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.
 genotype 4: in general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study 
 data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment with bitherapy as for 
 genotype 1.</p><p>40adults - duration of treatment - hcv/hiv co-infectionbitherapy
 : the recommended duration of treatment for hcv/hiv co-infected patients is 48 weeks with bitherapy, regardless of genotype.
 predictability of response and non-response in hcv/hiv co-infection - early virological response by 
 week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna, has been shown 
 to be predictive for sustained response. the negative predictive value for sustained response in 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; 
 study 1) (see section 5.1). a positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; study 1) was observed for 
 hcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving bitherapy.
 adults - duration of treatment - retreatmenttritherapy:</p><p>refer to the smpc for boceprevir.bitherapy: predictability of sustained virological response - all patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum hcv-rna below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive 
 48 weeks of bitherapy. retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. hcv-rna 
 below the limits of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 
 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
 retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been 
 studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy. 
 paediatric population (bitherapy only) – dose to be administereddosing for children 3 years of age and older and adolescent patients is determined by body surface area for pegintron and by body weight for ribavirin. the recommended dose of pegintron is 
 60</p><p>g/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).
 paediatric population (bitherapy only) - duration of treatment genotype 1: the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. by extrapolation from clinical 
 data on combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive 
 value 96 % for interferon alfa–2b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at 
 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. therefore, it is 
 recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination 
 be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.
 genotype 2 or 3: the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 24 weeks.
 genotype 4: only 5 children and adolescents with genotype 4 were treated in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical 
 trial. the recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. it is recommended that 
 children and adolescent patients receiving pegintron/ribavirin combination be discontinued 
 from therapy if their week 12 hcv-rna dropped &lt; 2 log
 10 compared to pretreatment or if they have detectable hcv-rna at treatment week 24.
 pegintron monotherapy – adultsdose to be administered
 as monotherapy the pegintron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 µg/kg/week. the lowest pegintron strength available is 50 µg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 µg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by 
 volume as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. for the 1.0 µg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate strengths can be used as shown in</p></section><section><header>table 2</header><p>. pegintron monotherapy was not studied in hcv/hiv co-infected patients.</p><p>41</p></section><section><header>table 2monotherapy dosing

 minimum delivery for pen is 0.2 ml.* must use vial.
 ** for patients &gt; 120 kg, the pegintron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight. this may require 
 combinations of various pegintron dose strengths and volumes.
 duration of treatmentfor patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months). the decision to extend therapy to one year of 
 treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging 
 fibrosis).
 dose modification for all patients (monotherapy and combination therapy)if severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with pegintron monotherapy or combination therapy, the dosages of pegintron and/or ribavirin must be modified as 
 appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. dose reduction of boceprevir is not recommended. 
 boceprevir must not be administered in the absence of pegintron and ribavirin.
 as adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose of pegintron and ribavirin should 
 be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose. guidelines were developed in clinical 
 trials for dose modification.

 special populationsrenal impairmentmonotherapy
 pegintron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data are not available 
 for the use of pegintron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). patients 
 with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. if renal 
 function decreases during treatment, pegintron therapy should be discontinued. 
 combination therapypatients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin smpc). when administered in combination therapy</p></section><section><header>,</header><p> patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
 hepatic impairmentthe safety and efficacy of pegintron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore pegintron must not be used for these patients.
 elderly ( 65 years of age)there are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of pegintron. data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of pegintron suggest no alteration in pegintron dose is necessary based on age 
 (see section 5.2).
 paediatric populationpegintron can be used in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients 3 years of age and older. method of administration
 pegintron should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. for special handling information see 
 section 6.6. patients may self-inject pegintron if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with

 in patients with chronic hepatitis c.</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and precautions for use
 psychiatric and central nervous system (cns)</header><p>severe cns effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during pegintron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 
 6-month follow-up period. other cns effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against 
 others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status 
 have been observed with alpha interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any signs or 
 symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate 
 therapeutic management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal 
 or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with pegintron be discontinued, 
 and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. 
 patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditionsif treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate 
 individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
 - the use of pegintron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). among children and adolescents treated with interferon 
 alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently 
 compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after
 treatment. as in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events 
 (e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).
 patients with substance use/abusehcv infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders 
 when treated with alpha interferon. if treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, 
 the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully 
 assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. if necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach 
 including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and 
 follow the patient. patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment 
 discontinuation. early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and 
 substance use is recommended.</p><p>46</p></section><section><header>growth and development (children and adolescents)</header><p>during the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common. long-term data available in children treated with the 
 combination therapy of pegylated interferon/ribavirin are indicative of substantial growth retardation. 
 thirty two percent (30/94) of subjects demonstrated &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height-for-age 
 percentile 5 years after completion of therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
 case by case benefit/risk assessment in children the expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, that resulted in reduced height in some patients.
 -
 this risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of 
 disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease 
 progression (such as hiv co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (hcv 
 genotype and viral load).
 whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the 
 risk of growth inhibition. although data are limited, no evidence of long-term effects on sexual 
 maturation was noted in the 5-year observational follow-up study.
 more significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some 
 patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. while these effects are generally 
 reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. very rarely, seizures have occurred 
 with high doses of interferon alpha.
 all patients in the selected chronic hepatitis c studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain 
 cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. 
 current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
 commencing treatment.
 acute hypersensitivity
 acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have 
 been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. if such a reaction develops during treatment with 
 pegintron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. transient rashes 
 do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
 cardiovascular system
 as with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction 
 and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving pegintron therapy require close monitoring. it 
 is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken 
 prior to and during the course of treatment. cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually 
 respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of pegintron therapy. there are no data 
 in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.
 hepatic failure
 pegintron increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. as with all 
 interferons
 , discontinue treatment with pegintron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. liver enzymes and hepatic function should be 
 closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.
 pyrexia
 while pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon 
 therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.</p><p>47hydrationadequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing pegintron therapy since hypotension 
 related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. fluid 
 replacement may be necessary.
 pulmonary changes
 pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed 
 rarely in interferon alpha treated patients. any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other 
 respiratory symptoms must have a chest x-ray taken. if the chest x-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or 
 there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if 
 appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and 
 treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
 autoimmune disease
 the development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment 
 with alpha interferons. patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at 
 increased risk. patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be 
 evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also 
 section 4.4 thyroid changes and section 4.8).
 cases of vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic 
 hepatitis c treated with interferon. this syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting 
 the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. if vkh syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment 
 should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
 ocular changes
 ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, serous retinal detachment, 
 and retinal artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha 
 interferons (see section 4.8). all patients should have a baseline eye examination. any patient 
 complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and 
 complete eye examination. periodic visual examinations are recommended during pegintron therapy, 
 particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or 
 hypertension. discontinuation of pegintron should be considered in patients who develop new or 
 worsening ophthalmological disorders.
 thyroid changes
 infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis c with interferon alpha have developed 
 thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. approximately 21 % of children 
 treated with pegintron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating 
 hormone (tsh). another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. 
 prior to initiation of pegintron therapy, tsh levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality 
 detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. determine tsh levels if, during the 
 course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. in the 
 presence of thyroid dysfunction, pegintron treatment may be continued if tsh levels can be 
 maintained in the normal range by medicine. children and adolescents should be monitored every 
 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. tsh).
 metabolic disturbances
 hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. 
 monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
 hcv/hiv co-infection
 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosispatients co-infected with hiv and receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) may beat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. caution should be used when adding pegintron and 
 ribavirin to haart therapy (see ribavirin smpc).</p><p>48hepatic decompensation in hcv/hiv co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosisco-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving haart may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with 
 ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. other baseline factors in co-infected patients that 
 may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and 
 elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
 co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (arv) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely 
 monitored, assessing their child-pugh score during treatment. patients progressing to hepatic 
 decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the arv 
 treatment reassessed.
 haematological abnormalities in hcv/hiv co-infected patientshcv/hiv co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and haart may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
 anaemia) compared to hcv mono-infected patients. although, the majority of them could be managed 
 by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this 
 population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “laboratory tests” and section 4.8). 
 patients treated with pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk 
 of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not 
 recommended (see section 4.5).
 patients with low cd4 countsin patients co-infected with hcv/hiv, limited efficacy and safety data (n = 25) are available in subjects with cd4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of 
 patients with low cd4 counts.
 please refer to the respective smpcs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken 
 concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product 
 and the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron and ribavirin.
 hcv/hbv coinfection
 cases of hepatitis b re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-
 infected with hepatitis b and c viruses treated with interferon. the frequency of such re-activation 
 appears to be low.
 all patients should be screened for hepatitis b before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis c; 
 patients co-infected with hepatitis b and c must then be monitored and managed according to current 
 clinical guidelines.
 dental and periodontal disorders
 dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients 
 receiving pegintron and ribavirin combination therapy. in addition, dry mouth could have a damaging 
 effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination 
 of pegintron and ribavirin. patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular 
 dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. if this reaction occurs, they 
 should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
 organ transplant recipients
 the safety and efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of 
 hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. preliminary data indicate 
 that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. liver 
 graft rejection has also been reported.
 other
 due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of 
 pegintron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies 
 the potential risk.</p><p>49laboratory testsstandard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all 
 patients prior to initiating therapy. acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior 
 to initiation of pegintron therapy are:
 platelets 100,000/mm3neutrophil count 1,500/mm3tsh levelmust be within normal limits
 laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as 
 clinically appropriate. hcv-rna should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).
 long term maintenance monotherapy
 it has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 μg/kg/week) is not 
 effective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of 
 disease progression in non responders with compensated cirrhosis. no statistically significant effect on the 
 time to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death 
 and/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. pegintron should 
 therefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.
 important information about some of the ingredients of pegintron 
 patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
 isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially 
 &quot;sodium-free&quot;.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>interaction studies have only been performed in adults.telbivudine
 a clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon 
 alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination 
 is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. the mechanism behind these 
 events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine smpc). moreover, the safety and 
 efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b has not 
 been demonstrated. therefore, the combination of pegintron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see 
 section 4.3).
 methadone
 in patients with chronic hepatitis c that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to 
 peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of pegintron subcutaneously for 4 weeks 
 increased r-methadone auc by approximately 15 % (95 % cl for auc ratio estimate 103 – 128 %). 
 the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. especially in patients on 
 a high dose of methadone, the risk for qtc prolongation should be considered.</p></section><section><header>effect of peginterferon alfa-2b on co-administered medicines</header><p>the potential interaction of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes wasevaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. in these studies, the effects of 
 multiple-dose regimens of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) were investigated in hepatitis c subjects 
 (1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week) (</p></section><section><header>table 4</header><p>). a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) and 
 tolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon 
 alfa-2b (pegintron) is administered with medicines metabolized by cyp2c9, cyp3a4 and 
 n-acetyltransferase. concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa-2b (pegintron) with caffeine or</p><p>50desipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. when patients are administered pegintron with medications metabolized by cyp1a2 or cyp2d6, the extent of the

 shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in 
 primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. 
 the potential risk in humans is unknown. pegintron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
 benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
 combination therapy with ribavirinribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
 breast-feeding 
 it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. 
 because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be 
 discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
 fertility
 there are no data available regarding potential effects of pegintron treatment on male or female 
 fertility.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with pegintron are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machines.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>adultstritherapyrefer to the smpc for boceprevir. bitherapy and monotherapysummary of the safety profile

 *these adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with pegintron monotherapy.#class label for interferon products, see below pulmonary arterial hypertension.description of selected adverse reactions in adultsmost cases of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were mild (who grades 1 or 2). there were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of pegintron in combination 
 with ribavirin (who grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and who grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).
 in a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b in 
 combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. these events 
 included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4). 
 cardiovascular (cvs) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with 
 pre-existing cvs disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). cardiomyopathy, 
 that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients 
 without prior evidence of cardiac disease. 
 cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) have been reported with interferon alfa products, 
 notably in patients with risk factors for pah (such as portal hypertension, hiv-infection, cirrhosis). 
 events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with 
 interferon alfa.</p><p>56ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, 
 loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
 a wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons 
 including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated),
 idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including 
 mononeuropathies and vogt-koyanagi-harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).

 mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in hiv-positive patients receiving nrti regimen and associated ribavirin for co-hcv infection (see section 4.4).
 laboratory values for hcv/hiv co-infected patientsalthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in hcv/hiv co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and 
 rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). haematological abnormalities 
 were more frequently reported in patients receiving pegintron in combination with ribavirin when 
 compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin

 reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.
 cd4 lymphocytes decreasetreatment with pegintron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute cd4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in cd4+ cell percentage. the decrease 
 in cd4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. the use of pegintron 
 in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of hiv viraemia 
 during therapy or follow-up. limited safety data (n= 25) are available in co-infected patients with 
 cd4+ cell counts &lt; 200/µl (see section 4.4).
 please refer to the respective smpcs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken 
 concurrently with hcv therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and 
 the potential for overlapping toxicities with pegintron in combination with ribavirin.
 paediatric population
 summary of the safety profilein a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination therapy of pegintron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly 
 for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. in general, the adverse reactions profile in children and 
 adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern 
 regarding growth inhibition. during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with pegintron and ribavirin, 
 growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). weight 
 loss and growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean 
 decrease from baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, 
 respectively) and growth velocity was inhibited (&lt; 3
 rd percentile in 70 % of the patients). 57at the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height percentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children 
 continued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity &lt; 3
 rd percentile). ninety-four of 107 subjects enrolled in the 5 year long-term follow-up trial. the effects on growth were less in those subjects 
 treated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. from pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-
 up among subjects treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 
 9.0 percentiles, respectively. twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of 
 subjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a &gt; 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment 
 to the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentile. eleven 
 percent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were 
 observed to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of &gt; 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end 
 of the 5 year long-term follow-up. for weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-
 for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, 
 respectively. for bmi, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, bmi-for-age percentiles 
 decreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively.
 decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up was most prominent in 
 prepubertal age children. the decline of height, weight and bmi z scores observed during the 
 treatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term 
 follow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). 
 in the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia 
 (80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema 
 (29 %). only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). the 
 majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. severe adverse 
 reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in 
 extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). important treatment-emergent 
 adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger 
 (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine 
 treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated tsh.

 §class effect of interferon-alfa containing products – reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric patients; with pegintron reported in adult patients.
 description of selected adverse reactions in children and adolescentsmost of the changes in laboratory values in the pegintron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or moderate. decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin 
 may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). while 
 changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with pegintron used in 
 combination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks 
 after the end of therapy.
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it allows 
 continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare professionals are 
 asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 
 appendix v
 .</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. the maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day. in general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving pegintron are 
 consistent with the known safety profile for pegintron; however, the severity of the events may be 
 increased. standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not 
 been shown to be useful. no specific antidote for pegintron is available; therefore, symptomatic 
 treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. if available, 
 prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (pcc).</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, interferons, atc code: l03ab10.recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an 
 average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. the average molecular mass is 
 approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
 mechanism of action
 in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of pegintron is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
 interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. 
 studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. however, certain monkey 
 species, e.g., rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to 
 human type 1 interferons.
 once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that 
 include the induction of certain enzymes. it is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible 
 for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-
 infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement</p><p>60of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic 
 effects.
 recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication 
 in vitro and in vivo. although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell 
 metabolism. this action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are 
 unable to leave the cell.
 pharmacodynamic effects
 pegintron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining 
 changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-
 oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-oas), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. subjects treated with 
 pegintron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. following single doses of pegintron 
 between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related 
 manner. neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of 
 pegintron.
 clinical efficacy and safety – adults
 tritherapy with pegintron, ribavirin and boceprevirrefer to the smpc for boceprevir.monotherapy with pegintron and bitherapy with pegintron and ribavirinnaïve patients
 two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (c/i97-010) with pegintron monotherapy; the other (c/i98-580) with pegintron in combination with ribavirin. eligible patients for these trials had chronic 
 hepatitis c confirmed by a positive hcv-rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay (&gt; 30 iu/ml), a 
 liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the 
 chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum alt.
 in the pegintron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis c patients were treated with 
 pegintron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. in 
 addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units [miu] three times a 
 week) as a comparator. this study showed that pegintron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (</p></section><section><header>table 8</header><p>).in the pegintron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the 
 following combination regimens:
 -
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).
 -
 pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 
 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).
 -
 interferon alfa-2b (3 miu three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
 in this trial, the combination of pegintron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly 
 more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 8</header><p>), particularly in patients infected with genotype 1 (</p></section><section><header>table 9</header><p>). sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
 hcv genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. 
 however, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin 
 administered in combination with pegintron or interferon alfa-2b. in those patients that received 
 &gt; 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, 
 response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received 
  10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (</p></section><section><header>table 9</header><p>), while response rates in patients that received &gt; 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher. 61</p></section><section><header>table 8sustained virological response (% patients hcv negative)

 * any subject with an undetectable hcv-rna level at the follow-up week 12 visit and missing data at the follow-up week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder. any subject with missing data in and after the follow-up week 12 
 window was considered to be a non-responder at week 24 of follow-up.
 the 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the pivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5 % vs
 . 14 %, for dose modification 18 % vs. 49 %.in a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (&lt; 600,000 iu/ml) received 
 pegintron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted 
 ribavirin. the overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. forty-one 
 percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 4 and week 24 of 
 therapy. in this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. the high 
 sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and 
 prospectively confirmed (n=48).
 limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher 
 sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 
 24 weeks of treatment).a large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two 
 pegintron/ribavirin regimens [pegintron 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in 
 combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and 
 peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily 
 (in two divided doses) in 3,070 treatment-naïve adults with chronic hepatitis c genotype 1. response

 * (hcv-rna pcr assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 iu/ml)lack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable hcv-rna with a &lt; 2 log
 10 reduction from baseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>63in all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. in patients of african american origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for hcv eradication), treatment with 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response 
 rate compared to pegintron 1 µg/kg dose. at the pegintron 1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained 
 virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal alt levels, in 
 patients with a baseline viral load &gt; 600,000 iu/ml, and in patients &gt; 40 years old. caucasian patients 
 had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the african americans. among patients 
 with undetectable hcv-rna at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %. 
 predictability of sustained virological response – naïve patients: virological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna.virological response 
 by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of hcv-rna. these

 nr: non-responder defined as serum/plasma hcv-rna positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.plasma hcv-rna is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central 
 laboratory
 *intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
 overall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 iu/ml). in this 
 subgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. for patients with prior 
 failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the 
 sustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively. among 480 patients with &gt; 2 log viral 
 reduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. in those patients 
 the svr was 12 %. 
 non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a 
 week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin 
 (12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). however, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in svr 
 regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
 long-term efficacy data-adultsa large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with pegintron (with or without ribavirin). the purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained 
 virologic response (svr) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 
 327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained 
 responders relapsed during the study.
 the kaplan-meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % 
 (95 % ci: 98-100 %). svr after treatment of chronic hcv with pegintron (with or without ribavirin) 
 results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 
 “cure” from chronic hcv. however, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in 
 patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
 clinical efficacy and safety – paediatric population

 hcv-rna were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus

 .long-term efficacy data - paediatric populationa five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis c patients after treatment in a multicentre trial. of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. the 
 purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (svr) and 
 assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained 
 responders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin 
 treatment. at the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained 
 responders completed the study. no paediatric subjects with svr had relapsed during the 5 years of 
 follow-up.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>pegintron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. the plasma half-life of pegintron 
 is prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. pegintron has a potential to depegylate to 
 free interferon alfa-2b. the biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but 
 weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
 following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours 
 post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
 pegintron c
 max and auc measurements increase in a dose-related manner. mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
 upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. there is, however, only a 
 modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay. 
 mean (sd) pegintron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent 
 clearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. the mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been 
 fully elucidated. however, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of 
 pegintron apparent clearance.
 renal impairment
 renal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of pegintron. in a single dose study 
 (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, c
 max, auc, and half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
 following multiple dosing of pegintron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week 
 for four weeks) the clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate 
 renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with 
 severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal 
 renal function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal 
 impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of pegintron</p><p>68for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy or tritherapy) (see section 4.3).
 because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that 
 patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with pegintron (see 
 section 4.2)
 hepatic impairment
 the pharmacokinetics of pegintron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic 
 dysfunction.
 elderly (≥ 65 years of age)
 the pharmacokinetics of pegintron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were 
 not affected by age. the data suggest that no alteration in pegintron dosage is necessary based on 
 advancing age.
 paediatric population
 multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for pegintron and ribavirin (capsules and oral solution) in 
 children and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis c have been evaluated during a clinical study. 
 in children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of pegintron at 
 60</p><p>g/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58 % (90 % ci: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5</p><p>g/kg/week.interferon neutralising factors
 interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received pegintron 
 in the clinical trial. interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of 
 interferon. the clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received 
 pegintron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.
 transfer into seminal fluid
 seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is 
 approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. however, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female 
 partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely 
 limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>pegintronadverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. these 
 studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most 
 monkeys.
 reproduction studies of pegintron have not been performed. interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an 
 abortifacient in primates. pegintron is likely to also cause this effect. effects on fertility have not been 
 determined. it is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into 
 experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). 
 pegintron showed no genotoxic potential.
 the relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mpeg), which is liberated from 
 pegintron by metabolism 
 in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in 
 in vitro mutagenicity assays. 69pegintron plus ribavirinwhen used in combination with ribavirin, pegintron did not cause any effects not previously seen with 
 either active substance alone. the major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate 
 anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.
 no studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with pegintron 
 on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. preclinical juvenile toxicity results have 
 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin 
 (see section 5.3 of rebetol smpc if pegintron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars

 contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header>1.what pegintron is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in this medicine is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicines called interferons. interferons are made by your body’s immune system to help 
 fight infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your 
 immune system. this medicine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the 
 liver.
 adults
 the combination of this medicine, ribavirin and boceprevir is recommended for use for some types of 
 chronic hepatitis c virus infection (also called hcv infection) in adults 18 years of age and older. it may 
 be used in adults who have not been previously treated for hcv infection or who have previously used 
 medicines called interferons and pegylated interferons.
 the combination of this medicine and ribavirin is recommended for adults 18 years of age and older who 
 have not previously been treated with these medicines. this includes adults also infected with clinically 
 stable hiv (human immunodeficiency virus). the combination can also be used to treat adults who have 
 already failed treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or 
 interferon alpha alone.
 if you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem 
 taking it, your doctor will likely prescribe this medicine alone.
 if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

 otaking this medicine in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicine(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction in 
 number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with this medicine alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk.
 owith</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with this 
 medicine and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine

 inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-
 injection.</header><p>the following instructions explain how to inject this medicine yourself. please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.</p></section><section><header>preparationcollect the necessary items before you begin:</header><p>-a vial of pegintron powder for injection;
 -
 an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare pegintron injection;
 -
 a 1 ml syringe;
 -
 a long needle (for example 0.8</p><p> 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to the pegintron powder vial;
 -
 a short needle (for example 0.3</p><p> 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;-
 a cleansing swab.
 wash your hands carefully.
 reconstituting pegintron powder for injection
 before reconstitution, this medicine may appear either as a white tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in 
 pieces, or as a white powder.
 when the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of pegintron powder, the solution 
 will be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in 
 0.5 ml).a small volume is lost during preparation of this medicine for injection and when the dose is measured 
 and injected. therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and pegintron powder to ensure 
 delivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of pegintron, solution for injection.
 -
 remove the protective cap from the pegintron vial.
 -
 clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. you can save the swab to clean the skin area 
 where you will inject the dose.
 -
 remove the syringe from the wrapping and</p></section><section><header>do not touch the tip of the syringe</header><p>.-
 take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe.
 -
 remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your 
 hand.
 -
 tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the 
 ampoule.
 -
 break off the top of the ampoule of solvent.
 -
 insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.
 -
 then insert the needle through the rubber top of the pegintron vial. gently place the needle tip 
 against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.
 -
 inject the solvent</p></section><section><header>slowly,</header><p> aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. do not aim the stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater 
 amount of bubbles. the solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. this is to be 
 expected and is not a cause for concern.
 -
 dissolve the entire contents by swirling the pegintron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the 
 needle and attached syringe in the vial.
 -</p></section><section><header>do not shake</header><p>, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is dissolved.
 -
 the contents should now be completely dissolved.
 -
 stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. 
 once all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small 
 ring of tiny bubbles around the top. use this solution immediately. if it cannot be used immediately, 
 the solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p><p>126measuring the dose of pegintron from the reconstituted powder for injectionturn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. be sure the tip of needle is in the pegintron 
 reconstituted solution. your other hand will be free to move the plunger. pull back on the plunger 
 slowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
 hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. remove the syringe from the long needle 
 leaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. take the short needle and 
 place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check 
 for air bubbles in the syringe. if you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe 
 gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. push up the plunger slowly back 
 to the correct dose. replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.
 be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°c. if the solution is cold, warm the syringe 
 between your palms. inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if 
 discolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. you are 
 now ready to inject the dose.
 injecting the solution
 select the injection site. the best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. 
 these are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this 
 site) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). if you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer 
 surface of the arm for injection.</p></section><section><header>change your injection site each time.</header><p>cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. wait for the area to dry. remove the needle guard. with one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. with your other hand, hold the syringe as you 
 would a pencil. insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. after the needle 
 is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. pull back the 
 plunger very slightly with one hand. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood 
 vessel. do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. inject the solution by 
 pushing the plunger all the way down gently.
 pull the needle straight out of the skin. press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if 
 necessary for several seconds. do not massage the injection site. if there is bleeding, cover with an 
 adhesive bandage.
 the vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. dispose of the syringe and needles safely in a closed container.</p><p>127</p></section><section><header>package leaflet: information for the userpegintron 50 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen

 fight infections and severe diseases. this medicine is injected into your body to work with your 
 immune system. this medicine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c, a viral infection of the 
 liver.
 adults
 the combination of this medicine, ribavirin and boceprevir is recommended for use for some types of 
 chronic hepatitis c virus infection (also called hcv infection) in adults 18 years of age and older. it may 
 be used in adults who have not been previously treated for hcv infection or who have previously used 
 medicines called interferons and pegylated interferons.

 -
 are infected with both</p></section><section><header>human immunodeficiency virus</header><p>(hiv-positive) and</p></section><section><header>hepatitis c virus</header><p> (hcv) and are being treated with an anti-hiv medicine(s) – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (</p></section><section><header>nrti</header><p>), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (</p></section><section><header>haart</header><p>)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions.
 otaking this medicine in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicine(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction in 
 number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. 
 patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of 
 worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with this medicine alone or in 
 combination with ribavirin may increase their risk.
 owith</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> or</p></section><section><header>stavudine</header><p>, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv 
 infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not 
 your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with this 
 medicine and ribavirin combination therapy and</p></section><section><header>zidovudine</header><p> could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine 
 with this medicine and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended.

 in studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. the effect of this 
 medicine on human pregnancy is not known. girls or women of childbearing potential need to use 
 effective birth control during the treatment with this medicine.
 ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. therefore, you and your partner must take</p></section><section><header>specialprecautions</header><p> in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:-
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>girl</header><p>or a</p></section><section><header>woman</header><p>of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin:you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 
 4 months after treatment is stopped. you must use an effective birth control during the time you are 
 taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor. 
 -
 if you are a</p></section><section><header>man</header><p>who is taking ribavirin:do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you</p></section><section><header>use a condom</header><p>. if your female partner is not pregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and 
 for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your partner must use an effective birth control 
 during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be

 judgement for you, or the child you are caring for.
