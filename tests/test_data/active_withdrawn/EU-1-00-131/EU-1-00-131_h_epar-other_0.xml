 smpc 
 the potential interaction of peginterferon alfa 2b (pegintron) 
 on substrates of metabolic enzymes was evaluated in 3 
 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. in these 
 studies, the effects of multiple dose regimens of 
 peginterferon alfa 2b (pegintron) were investigated in 
 hepatitis c subjects (1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 
 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week). a clinically significant 
 pharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between 
 peginterferon alfa 2b (pegintron) and tolbutamide, 
 midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is 
 necessary when peginterferon alfa 2b (pegintron) is 
 administered with medicines metabolized by cyp2c9, 
 cyp3a4 and n acetyltransferase. concomitant 
 administration of peginterferon alfa 2b (pegintron) with 
 caffeine or desipramine modestly increased the exposure of 
 caffeine and desipramine. when patients are administered 
 pegintron with medications metabolized by cyp1a2 or 
 cyp2d6, the extent of the decrease in cytochrome p 450 
 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with 
 medicines which have a narrow therapeutic margin.

 an overview of postmarketing surveillance for ifn and 
 peg-ifn involved a cumulative review of 54 adverse event 
 reports with ifn and 57 adverse event reports with peg-ifn 
 of retinal detachment. a number of these reports are 
 confounded with independent risk factors for the 
 development of retinal detachment. furthermore, retinal 
 detachment is more common with increasing age, and many 
 of the reports occurred in individuals over the age of 49 
 which is the peak age at which retinal detachment occurrs. 
  nevertheless, there were reports with no clear confounders 
 and with ages below the peak incidence of retinal 
 detachment. therefore the term of “serous retinal 
 detachment” has been included into the established ocular 
 sections of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the smpc.

 combination therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin, in

 a review of reported relevant prospective cases of maternal 
 and paternal exposure to ribavirin has been carried out. only 
 a limited number of cases are available. however, a large 
 number of data would be necessary to draw a definitive 
 conclusion on the teratogenic potential of ribavirin. the 
 malformative risk is possible in human, but it is not 
 confirmed. for paternal exposure, the malformative risk is 
 unlikely in humans. taking into account the number of 
 reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal exposure 
 with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is 
 recommended to remove the requirement of double 
 contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male 
 patient. for female patients, the chmp agreed that they 
 should be instructed to use an effective contraceptive. for 
 male patients, the chmp recommended that either male 
 patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be 
 advised to use an effective contraceptive.

 issue, and to improve the information available to prescribers 
 in smpc of interferon-alfa containing products, the chmp 
 requested the mah to provide yearly literature review on the 
 management of psychiatric disorders in hcv-infected 
 patients. this first literature review indicated that, as for 
 patients with psychiatric disorders, patients with substance 
 abuse/use need to be carefully managed with the aim of 
 improving the adherence to therapy and the treatment 
 success. it was noted that this issue was currently not 
 addressed in the smpc of interferon-alfa/ribavirin containing 
 products as well as data on the management of patients with 
 alcohol abuse. thus, the recommendations in the product

 in the scope of the renewal, the chmp highlighted that 
 growth inhibition is an important issue to be monitored. 
 information on growth retardation is already provided in the 
 spc section 4.4 but was not present in 4.8. as a consequence 
 growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for 
 age)&quot; has been included in section 4.8 of the smpc. 
  furthermore the chmp highlighted that an important issue 
 arisen from previous psurs is psychiatric adverse reactions. 
 in the smpc, this issue is already addressed in sections 4.3 
 and 4.4. however, in section 4.8, information on these 
 adverse events in children was  missing and as such has been 
 inlcuded.
  although suicidal ideation and/or attempts were not reported 
 in the clinical trial of paediatric patients treated with 
 peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin (p02538), suicidal ideation or 
 attempts were reported among paediatric patients 
 participating in the standard interferon/ribavirin clinical trials 
 (p00018/p00321). based on these reports, these terms have 
 been included in the introna and rebetol smpcs in section 
 4.8. for harmonization of the potential paediatric events that 
 may occur when a pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy is 
 used, the terms suicidal ideation and suicide attempts have 
 been added to section 4.8 of the smpc.

 relationship could not be excluded between pegylated 
 interferon alfa 2b and the adverse reaction &quot;pericarditis&quot;. 
 pericarditis is serious and may be fatal if diagnosis is delayed, 
 therefore, in order to increase physicians awareness this 
 adverse reaction has been included in section 4.8 of the spc. 
 a cumulative search was carried out for all reports of bipolar 
 disorder up until 31 december 2007.  the data from this 
 review, together with abundant data from the literature, 
 suggest that treatment with interferon alpha 2b may induce 
 mania and bipolar disorders, especially in patients with 
 predisposing factors such as previous psychiatric history, 
 substance use disorders or family history of bipolar 
 disorders.

 a cumulative search for overdose cases that occurred in 
 patients taking peginterferon alfa-2b up until 24 january 
 2008 was conducted. of the 68 cases reporting an overdose 
 of peginterferon alfa-2b there were three cases of note: one 
 was with a potential overdose of 10.5 times the intended 
 dose (about 500 mcg), one of 7.5 times the dose (1200 mcg) 
 and one of 5 times the dose (600 mcg, taken over a 5-day 
 period). there were an additional seven cases reported in 
 patients taking between 300 and 575 mcg (2 to 4 times the 
 intended dose), with a maximum of four times the intended 
 dose administered based on a review of these cases, the 
 majority of reported events resulting from an overdose of up 
 to 10.5 times the intended dose were generally events that 
 are part of the known spectrum of pharmacologic effects of 
 alfa interferons but perhaps were of greater severity than the 
 adverse events reported for peginterferon alfa-2b during 
 therapeutic use. the spc has been updated to reflect this.

 data from the pivotal studies conducted in hiv/hcv 
 coinfected patients as well as published data consistently 
 show a higher risk of anaemia when ribavirin and zidovudine 
 are co-administered. anaemia is the primary cause for 
 ribavirin dose reduction. since ribavirin dose reduction may 
 negatively impact sustained virologic response, risk factors 
 for anaemia such as concomitant use of zidovudine is a cause 
 of concern on a safety but also efficacy point of view.  as such 
 the product information is revised to include a warning to 
 prescribers that the concomitant use of ribavirin with 
 zidovudine is not recommended and to highlight the 
 associated risk of anaemia.

 this was a multicenter, long-term follow-up study of subjects 
 with chronic hepatitis c (hcv) who had been treated in a 
 prior study with peginterferon alfa-2b (with or without 
 ribavirin). this study aimed to assess the durability of 
 virologic response and to assess hcv disease progression.  
 overall the results of the study confirm the durability of the 
 virologic response up to 5 years. the likelihood of 
 maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who 
 initially achieved a sustained response is 99 % (95 % ci: 
 98-100 %). however, this does not preclude the occurrence 
 of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including 
 hepatocarcinoma).

 had no clinical relevance. in two clinical studies in hcv-hiv 
 coinfected patients co-administration of ribavirin with

 furthermore there is evidence that ribavarin does not

 this in vitro interaction has no clinical impact the chmp

 this variation concerns an up date of section 4.5 of the spc

 pegintron treatment on the pharmacokinetics of methadone. 
 this study was carried out because some individuals who 
 have previously used injected narcotics and subsequently  
 take methadone  have been identified as being infected with 
 hepatitis c.  therefore these patients may be candidates for 
 therapy with pegintron/viraferonpeg.  the results 
 demonstrate a small (about 15% to 19%) increase in the 
 auc and cmax of methadone at addition of pegintron

 this variation is submitted further to the chmp conclusions 
 on ribavirin fum 25 in which a cumulative review of pure red 
 cell aplasia (prca) was requested to determine the number 
 of reported cases and further characterize this effect. pure 
 red cell aplasia is a condition where the body stops or 
 reduces the production of red blood cells. this causes severe 
 anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual 
 tiredness and a lack of energy. a number of cases reported in 
 the safety review are in favour of a potential link between 
 ribavirin and/or interferon therapy and the development of 
 pure red cell aplasia due to a suggestive chronology.  the 
 number of cases of pure red cell aplasia, although remaining 
 limited, increased since the last safety review on this issue 
 (fum 25 dated 7th april 2005). as a result of this safety 
 review, the chmp agreed to the addition of the adverse 
 reaction pure red cell aplasia in section 4.8 of the spc and

 the need to harmonise the spcs of the ribavirin and alfa 
 interferon containing medicinal products has been 
 highlighted on previous occasions as existing discrepancies 
 regarding the recommendations for pregnancy and lactation 
 might be confusing for prescribers and patients. the chmp 
 concluded that contraceptive measures should be used 
 during treatment and for 4 months after treatment 
 discontinuation in female patients and during treatment and 
 for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male patients 
 and their female partners. section 4.6 &quot;pregnancy and 
 lactation&quot; of the spc of pegintron has therefore been up 
 dated to add the seven month duration of contraception after 
 treatment termination  for male patients and their female 
 partners when alfa-interferon is used in combination with

 (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha 
 interferons. patients should be closely monitored for any 
 signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. if such 
 symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these 
 undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing 
 physician and the need for adequate therapeutic 
 management should be considered. if psychiatric symptoms 
 persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is 
 recommended that treatment with pegintron be 
 discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric 
 intervention as appropriate. 
   patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric 
 conditions:  if treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged 
 necessary in patients with existence or history of severe 
 psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after 
 having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and 
 therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
   dental and periodontal disorders: dental and periodontal

 clearance of pegintron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
 clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in 
 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal 
 function. based on single dose data, clearance was similar in 
 patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in 
 patients who were receiving hemodialysis. the dose of 
 pegintron for monotherapy should be reduced in patients 
 with moderate or severe renal impairment. patients with 
 creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/minute must not be treated with 
 pegintron in combination with ribavirin.
   because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon 
 pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with 
 severe renal impairment be closely monitored during 
 treatment with pegintron.
   the spc recommendations on use in patients with renal 
 impairment are as follows:
   monotherapy: pegintron should be used with caution in 
 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. in 
 patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine 
 clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of pegintron 
 should be reduced by 25 %. patients with severe renal 
 dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should 
 have the starting dose of pegintron reduced by 50 %. data 
 are not available for the use of pegintron in patients with 
 creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute. patients with severe 
 renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be 
 closely monitored. if renal function decreases during

 of the spc further to the submission of the final report on the 
 study &quot;effects of multiple-dose pegintron (sch 54031 
 peginterferon alfa-2b) on the activity of drug metabolizing 
 enzymes in volunteers with chronic hepatitis c&quot;.
   this study showed that patients receiving once weekly 
 pegintron (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase 
 in activity of cyp2d6 and cyp2c8/9. no change in activity of 
 cyp1a2, cyp3a4, or n-acetyltransferase was observed.

 window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (cyp2c9) and 
 flecainide (cyp2d6). 
   these findings may partly relate to improved metabolic 
 capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients 
 undergoing treatment with pegintron. caution is therefore 
 advised when pegintron treatment is initiated for chronic 
 hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow 
 therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic

 the use of interferon alpha in patient undergoing solid organ 
 transplantation is controversial and has been debated over 
 the years as chronic hepatitis c (chc) regularly recurs after 
 liver transplantation and concomitant chc is common in 
 patients undergoing renal transplantation. based on case 
 series, there seems to be an increased risk for rejection in 
 patients with kidney grafts, but, surprisingly, no such 
 tendencies have been reported (or actually refuted) in 
 patients with liver grafts.
   following reports of several cases of liver transplant rejection 
 in the psur, the following warning was added to section 4.4 
 of the spc: &quot;organ transplant recipients: the safety and 
 efficacy of pegintron alone or in combination with ribavirin 
 for treatment of hepatitis c in liver or other organ transplant 
 recipients have not been studied. preliminary data indicates 
 that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an 
 increased rate of kidney graft rejection. liver graft rejection 
 has also been reported.
   based on an analysis of safety data, the adverse reactions: 
 rhabdomyolysis/myositis, renal insufficiency and renal 
 failure were added as rare reactions.  ulcerative and 
 ischaemic colitis and aplastic anaemia were added as very 
 rare reactions.

 dosing tables were added to section 4.2 of the spc to provide 
 advice on the recommended strength and volume of 
 pegintron to be injected based on the patient&apos;s body weight.
   retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that the 
 response to treatment was correlated with body weight in 
 that lighter patients had a better response than heavier 
 patients.  as a result of this, the clinical trials of 
 pegintron/viraferonpeg used dosages based on body weight.  
 results from the pegintron/viraferonpeg monotherapy study 
 confirmed that when dosing is based on body weight, body 
 weight is no longer a predictive factor for response.  
 therefore being able to titrate the dose according to the 
 individual patient&apos;s weight is important for efficacy.
   the currently authorised formulations of pegintron include 5 
 vial and pen strengths: 50, 80, 100, 120 and 150 µg/0.5 ml.  
 although  the physician is advised on the appropriate dose 
 per kg, no guidance is given on what strength to prescribe or 
 the amount the patient needs to inject to obtain the required 
 dosage.  there is an additional complication in that the 
 dosing recommendations for pegintron when used in 
 combination with rebetol are 1.5 µg/kg/week whilst in 
 monotherapy the dose is either 0.5 or 1.0 µg/kg/week.
   if a reduced dose is necessary because of adverse events, 
 the current recommendations are to reduce the pegintron 
 dose by half but again no recommendations as to how this is 
 to be achieved are given.
   the tables which have been added to section 4.2 of the spc

   in the french consensus conference on hepatitis c  it is 
 stated that biopsy may not be necessary if a decision to treat 
 has been made on other grounds and the primary objective is 
 viral eradication.  this is also largely in line with other 
 national guidelines.  the viral eradication rate is sufficiently 
 high for patients with genotype 2/3 that treatment is 
 indicated in many cases even if the histology turns out to be 
 benign.  therefore histology is not always needed.

 this variation refers to changes to sections 4.2, 4.4. 4.6. 4.8 
 and 5.1 of the spc. 
   changes were made to section 4.2 and section 5.1 to include 
 information on the  predictability of sustained  virological 
 response with recommendations for treatment duration.  
 during a concurrent scientific advice procedure, the mah 
 presented data that a reliable decision regarding treatment 
 discontinuation can be made at 3 months.  patients who fail 
 to achieve virological response after 12 weeks treatment are 
 highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders 
 (negative predictive value 100% for combination therapy, 
 98% for monotherapy). 
   for patients with genotype 1 who are responders at week 12, 
 combination therapy should be continued for another 9 
 months.  all patients with genotype 2 or 3 achieved 
 virological response following 12 weeks of combination 
 therapy.  these patients should be treated for a total of 6 
 months with the decision to extend therapy to one year

   for patients on pegintron monotherapy, responders at 12 
 weeks should have treatment continued for at least a further 
 3 months with the decision to extend therapy to one year of 
 treatment based on the above prognostic factors.sections 
 4.4 and 4.8 of the spc were updated with regard to
