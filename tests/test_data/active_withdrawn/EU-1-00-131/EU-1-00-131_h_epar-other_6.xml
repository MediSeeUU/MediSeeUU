 1.1. 
 introduction</header><p>pegintron (peginterferon alfa-2b) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis c who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum 
 hcv-rna or anti-hcv. the best way to use pegintron in this indication is in combination with 
 ribavirin. 
 the spontaneous remission rate in chronic hepatitis c is very low and there are currently no licensed 
 alternative treatment options to alfa interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c.</p><p>
 this variation concerns a revision of section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics 
 to include the retreatment of patients who have failed prior therapy with alfa-interferon (pegylated or 
 nonpegylated) and ribavirin. a new maximum ribavirin dose of 1,400 mg for patients over 105 kg of 
 weight is also proposed. 
 data from the epic (evaluation of pegintron in control of hepatitis) studies program is submitted in 
 support of this variation.</p><p>the epic studies program consists of three clinical trials in patients with 
 chronic hepatitis c with at least moderate fibrosis who have failed prior therapy with alpha interferon 
 (including peginterferon alfa) and ribavirin. protocol p02370 assesses sustained viral response (svr), 
 p02570 assesses whether low dose peginterferon alfa-2b (0.5 mcg/kg/w.) can slow progression of 
 fibrosis and p02569 whether this therapy delays progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with 
 cirrhosis. in this submission data from study p02370 is presented.</p><p>
 the epic program was subject to advice from the chmp in september 2002 and the studies 
 programme was accepted, including the single arm design of study p02370, with some caveats related 
 to the assessment of safety.</p><p>
 no formal interim analysis was planned, but data were available for review on an ongoing basis. data 
 from the analysis of october 2003 were made public at the european association for the study of the 
 liver (easl) annual meeting in april 2005. in november 2005, data were also presented to fda and 
 the eu rapporteur (sweden). it was accepted that an interim analysis based on all subjects enrolled by 
 1 april 2004, the first cohort, could be submitted as a basis for a label change. this manner of 
 proceeding;</p><p>repeat analyses, making study data public, followed by a formal interim analysis and a 
 regulatory submission,</p><p>is ill suited to control for the overall type-1 error. nevertheless, as data were 
 already made public and appeared convincingly far from the predetermined cut-off for a meaningful 
 clinical effect, the submission strategy was accepted by the chmp.</p><p>
 further to the submission of this variation in september 2006 the marketing authorisation holder 
 (mah) informed the chmp in february 2007 that in some instances the hepatitis c virus ribonucleic 
 acid (hcv-rna) assays conducted in the company’s laboratories (in-house polymerase chain 
 reaction (pcr) assay) to quantitatively assess hcv-rna from subjects samples in this clinical trial 
 had underreported the levels of hcv-rna as evidence by the under recovery of the positive control.</p><p>
 a corrective action plan was developed by the mah that included the development of new and 
 revised procedures with additional assay and laboratory controls to ensure confidence in the 
 robustness of the assay and retesting of the impacted samples. the retested sample results were</p><p>
 submitted to the chmp for assessment and had no meaningful impact on the study results. 
 the data presented in this report constitutes the retested sample data.

 alfa 2b plus rebetol who failed to respond to previous combination therapy (any interferon treatment 
 in combination with repairing). data from two further studies has been submitted in support of the 
 safety profile associated with</p><p>retreatment of previous nonresponders and is discussed in section 3.3 
 ‘clinical safety’ of this report.</p><p>these two trials are the registration trial c/i98-580 in treatment naive 
 patients and study p02314, an investigator-initiated study performed to support rebetol weight-based 
 dosing in the united states.</p></section><section><header>study p0230 objectives</header><p>primary: to estimate svr after treatment with peginterferon alfa 2b 1.5 mcg/kg/w and ribavirin 800 – 1400 mg/d for 48 weeks. svr was defined as undetectable plasma hcv rna at the end of 24 weeks 
 of follow-up.</p><p>
 secondary: the identification of non-responders to study therapy for inclusion in studies p02570 and 
 p02569.</p><p>
 the hypothesis to be tested was that the svr in non-responders and relapse patients is higher than 
 10%.</p></section><section><header>design</header><p>single arm, multicenter (132, 107 non-us sites) study in patients with chronic hepatitis c who failed to respond or relapsed after treatment with combination therapy (any interferon and ribavirin). patients 
 with</p><p>undetectable viral load at week 12 continued on therapy for a total of 48 weeks then entered a 
 24-week follow up period (no treatment); subjects who were hcv rna positive at treatment week
 12 (tw12) were to be discontinued from this trial and enrolled in a maintenance therapy trial.
 there were deviations from the protocol for subjects with detectable hcv rna at treatment week 12. 
 some of these subjects were allowed to continue treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in 
 study p02370: 
 prior to november 2003 subjects with hcv rna level decreased ≥2 log10 were given deviations to 
 continue. 
 november 2003 to october 2004 subjects with hcv rna level of ≤750 iu/ml were given deviations 
 to continue.</p></section><section><header>study population</header><p>adults (18-65 years of age) with chronic hepatitis c, regardless of hcv genotype, with moderate to advanced hepatic fibrosis (metavir f2, f3, or f4) who failed previous therapy with alfa- interferon

 overall approximately 37 % of patients had undetectable plasma hcv-rna levels at week 12 of 
 therapy.</p><p>in this subgroup, there was a 57 % (282/499) sustained virological response rate. 
 in patients with detectable hcv-rna week 12, other factors in addition to quantitative viral response 
 are likely to have influenced the decision to continue or not on combination therapy. therefore 
 outcome in patients who continued combination therapy probably overestimates the benefit of 
 continued therapy. this, however, is not self evident as, for example,</p><p>a high fibrosis score could be 
 viewed as an incitement to continue combination therapy, e.g. in patient with a low viral load or viral 
 log reduction of ≥2, even if a positive outcome was considered less likely.</p><p>

 combination therapy and information has been provided in the spc
 .</p><p>the svr rates in the spc refer to “below lld, no signal detected”. the chmp considered whether svr in patients close to detectability, i.e “lld, signal detected”, should be mentioned in the spc.</p><p>
 the overall svr in patients previously treated with interferon/ribavirin and peginterferon/ribavirin 
 viral load below lld but signal detected is 18% and 21% respectively.</p><p> however “lld, signal 
 detected” is assay dependent and thus not interpretable by assays other than the in house assay of the 
 marketing authorisation holder. as such this information has not been included in the spc.</p><p>

 to data from study p02370, data from treatment-naïve subjects enrolled in the registration trial c/i98-

 based dosing in the united states were</p><p>taken into consideration.</p><p> patient exposure there were 1341 subjects in the safety population of study p02370 all of whom received treatment. because of the study design the percentage of subjects receiving treatment decreased from 93% (1243 
 subjects) at tw 18 to 50% (669 subjects) at tw 24. forty-five percent of the subjects (598/1341) 
 received 48 weeks of treatment.</p><p> 
 adverse events to assess the safety profile associated with retreatment of previous nonresponders, the adverse events (ae) profile for subjects enrolled in study p02370 (prior nonresponders) was compared with the ae 
 profile of treatment-naïve subjects enrolled in the registration trial c/i98-580
 . common ae occurring during the first 18 weeks of treatment in each trial were compared.</p><p>patients in study p02370 generally experienced individual aes with a lower frequency. this is likely 
 due to a variety of factors including the exclusion of subjects with a history of moderate or severe 
 depression and subjects with intolerance to ribavirin/interferon based on their prior treatment 
 experience.</p><p>additionally, subjects who experienced significant aes with prior treatment may have 
 chosen to not be retreated.</p><p>likewise investigators may have chosen not to retreat such subjects even if 
 the subjects were willing to be retreated.</p><p>
 overall the pattern of aes was qualitatively as expected and there were no new safety issues.</p><p>
 serious adverse events and deaths there was one death on therapy. this was a 66 year old man who entered coma due to a cerebral haemorrhage on day 30 of therapy. this was reported as unlikely to be related.</p><p>cerebral haemorrhage 
 is a listed event and was much discussed in relation to the japanese experience with alpha interferons.</p><p>
 the incidence of serious adverse events was similar to the incidence reported in treatment naïve 
 patients. in f2 patients 7%, f3 9% and f4 10%. one patient underwent liver transplantation, one 
 developed oesophageal varices and there were three reports of liver malignancies. the most frequently 
 reported saes were pneumonia (8), neutropenia (5), “chest pain” (5) and suicidal ideations (5). the 8 
 cases of “pneumonia” included two cases of lobar pneumonia and 6 not further specified.</p><p>

 plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis c were detailed in this interim report.</p><p>
 the spontaneous remission rate in chronic hepatitis c is very low. all patients included in the study 
 had fibrosis and about 40% cirrhosis, i.e. a poor long-term prognosis. therefore a sustained viral 
 response rate about 20% as demonstrated in this submission convincingly demonstrates efficacy. 
 there are currently no licensed alternative treatment options to (peg)interferon plus</p><p>ribavirin in the 
 treatment of chronic</p><p>hepatitis c.</p><p>
 efficacy results however differ significantly with regard to the mode of prior treatment failure 
 (“relapse” versus “nonresponder”) and with regard to the previous therapy regimen. nonresponder 
 patients whose previous combination therapy included nonpegylated interferon/ribavirin were more 
 likely to respond to treatment than patients who had previously received pegylated interferon/ribavirin 
 (17% vs. 4%). the low response rate in prior non-responders to the same therapy is expected. 
 nevertheless, “near response” to prior therapy and, e.g. a short duration of prior therapy would be a 
 reason to try to induce sustained response in a patient with poor prognosis due to fibrosis/cirrhosis, not 
 least as there are no alternative curative therapies currently available and that viral response at week 
 12 can be used to identify patients with an increased likelihood to become sustained responders.</p><p>
 probably due to selection based on prior tolerance to interferon plus ribavirin therapy, the overall 
 incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions was lower than in treatment naïve patients. in patients 
 with cirrhosis a higher incidence of haematotoxicity was reported as expected. there were no 
 unexpected findings. overall there are no clinically relevant safety differences related to the use of 
 ribavirin 1400 mg in patients weighing more than 105 kg, and the 1400 mg dose is accepted in these 
 patients.</p><p>
 despite the well-known tolerability and safety concerns related to treatment with interferon plus 
 ribavirin for one year, the benefit–risk balance of pegintron in the treatment of hepatitis c patients 
 who have failed previous treatment with interferon alfa (pegylated or non-pegylated) and ribavarin 
 medicinal product no longer authorised combination is considered favourable, especially as viral response at week 12 can be used to identify patients with an increased likelihood to become sustained responders.</p><p>
