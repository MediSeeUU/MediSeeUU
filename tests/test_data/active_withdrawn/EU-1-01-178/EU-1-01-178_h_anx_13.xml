 dose modification guidelines the 300 mg/m2/day dose level may be adjusted to 200 mg/m2/day then to 100 mg/m2/day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity. when toxicity is controlled, doses may be carefully 
 readjusted upward. with appropriate clinical monitoring, individual patients may benefit from doses 
 above 300 mg/m
 2/day. doses greater than 650 mg/m2/day have not been evaluated in patients with ctcl. in clinical trials, bexarotene was administered for up to 118 weeks to patients with ctcl. 
 treatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.</p><p>
 3 paediatric population the safety and efficacy of bexarotene in children (aged below 18 years) have not been established. no data are available.</p><p> 
 elderly patients of the total number of patients with ctcl in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years or older, while 30% were 70 years or older. no overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or 
 older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be 
 ruled out. the standard dose should be used in the elderly.</p><p> patients with renal impairment no formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency. clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a minor excretory pathway 
 for bexarotene. in all evaluated patients, the estimated renal clearance of bexarotene was less than 
 1 ml/minute. in view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored 
 carefully while on bexarotene therapy.</p><p>
 method of administration</p><p>

 targretin capsules should be taken as a single oral daily dose with a meal. the capsule should not be 
 chewed.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. pregnancy and lactation.

 donate blood for transfusion. butylated hydroxyanisole, an ingredient in targretin, may cause 
 irritation to the mucous membranes, therefore the capsules must be swallowed intact and not chewed.</p><p>lipids hyperlipidaemia has been identified as an effect associated with the use of bexarotene in clinical studies. fasting blood lipid determinations (triglycerides and cholesterol) should be performed before 
 bexarotene therapy is initiated and at weekly intervals</p><p>until the lipid response to bexarotene is 
 established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and then at intervals no less than monthly 
 thereafter. fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalised with appropriate intervention prior to 
 bexarotene therapy. every attempt should be made to maintain triglyceride levels below 4.52 mmol/l 
 in order to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae. if fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated 
 during treatment, institution of antilipaemic therapy is recommended, and if necessary,</p><p>dose 
 reductions (from 300 mg/m
 2/day of bexarotene to 200 mg/m2/day, and if necessary to 100 mg/m2/day) or treatment discontinuation. data from clinical studies indicate that bexarotene concentrations were 
 not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin. however, concomitant administration of 
 4 gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene and therefore, concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
 elevations of serum cholesterol should be managed according to current medical practice.</p><p> pancreatitis acute pancreatitis associated with elevations of fasting serum triglycerides has been reported in clinical studies. patients with ctcl having risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior episodes of 
 pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes 
 mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated 
 with pancreatic toxicity) should not be treated with bexarotene, unless the potential benefit outweighs 
 the risk.</p><p>
 liver function test (lft) abnormalities lft elevations associated with the use of bexarotene have been reported. based on data from ongoing clinical trials, elevation of lfts resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in 
 dose or discontinuation of therapy. baseline lfts should be obtained, and lfts should be carefully 
 monitored weekly during the first month and then monthly thereafter. consideration should be given 
 to a suspension or discontinuation of bexarotene if test results reach greater than three times the upper 
 limit of normal values for sgot/ast, sgpt/alt, or bilirubin.</p><p>
 thyroid function test alterations changes in thyroid function tests have been observed in patients receiving bexarotene, most often noted as a reversible reduction in thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total t
 4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored at least 
 monthly during treatment and as indicated by the emergence of symptoms consistent with 
 hypothyroidism. patients with symptomatic hypothyroidism on bexarotene therapy have been treated 
 with thyroid hormone supplements with resolution of symptoms.</p><p>
 leucopenia leucopenia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. the majority of cases resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. determination of white blood cell 
 count with differential count should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then 
 monthly thereafter.</p><p>
 anaemia anaemia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. determination of haemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then monthly 
 thereafter. decreases of haemoglobin should be managed according to current medical practice.</p><p>
 psychiatric disorders depression, depression aggravated, anxiety, and mood alterations have been reported in patients treated with systemic retinoids, including bexarotene. particular care should be taken in patients with a 
 history of depression. patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate 
 treatment if necessary. awareness by family or friends may be useful to detect mental health 
 deterioration.</p><p>
 lens opacities following bexarotene 
 treatment, some patients were observed to have previously undetected lens 
 opacities or a change in pre-existing lens opacities unrelated to treatment duration or dose level of 
 exposure. given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in the older patient 
 population represented in the clinical studies, there was no apparent association between the incidence 
 of lens opacity formation and bexarotene administration. however, an adverse effect of long-term 
 bexarotene treatment on lens opacity formation in humans has not been excluded. any patient treated 
 with bexarotene who experiences visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic 
 examination.</p><p>
 5 vitamin a supplementation because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin a, patients should be advised to limit vitamin a supplements to 
 ≤15,000 iu/day to avoid potential additive toxic effects.</p><p> 
 patients with diabetes mellitus caution should be exercised when administering bexarotene in patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones). based 
 on the known mechanism of action,</p><p>bexarotene may potentially</p><p>enhance the action of these agents, 
 resulting in hypoglycaemia. no cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of bexarotene as 
 monotherapy have been reported.</p><p>
 photosensitivity the use of some retinoids has been associated with photosensitivity. patients should be advised to minimise exposure to sunlight and avoid sun lamps during therapy with bexarotene, as 
 in vitro data indicate that bexarotene may potentially have a photosensitising effect.</p><p>
 oral contraceptives bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of oestroprogestive contraceptives. thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a woman of 
 childbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal form of contraception is also required, because 
 bexarotene belongs to a therapeutic class for which the human malformative risk is high.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 targretin is not recommended in children (aged below 18 years).</p><p>
 targretin contains a small amount of sorbitol, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of 
 fructose intolerance should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>effects of other substances on bexarotene no formal studies to evaluate interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4 (cyp3a4), coadministration with other 
 cyp3a4 substrates such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, protease inhibitors, clarithromycin and 
 erythromycin may theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. furthermore, 
 co-administration with cyp3a4 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone or 
 phenobarbital may theoretically cause a reduction in plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p><p>
 caution is advised in case of combination with cyp3a4 substrates having a narrow therapeutic 
 margin i.e. immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) as well as 
 cyp3a4-metabolised cytotoxics, i.e. cyclophosphamide, etoposide, finasteride, ifosfamide, 
 tamoxifen, vinca-alcaloids.</p><p>
 a population analysis of plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with ctcl indicated that 
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of 
 bexarotene. the mechanism of this interaction is unknown. under similar conditions, bexarotene 
 concentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin or levothyroxine. 
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended.</p><p>
 effects of bexarotene on other substances there are indications that bexarotene may induce cyp3a4. therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-induction of its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels 
 greater than 300 mg/m
 2/day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome p450 3a4, such as tamoxifen. for example bexarotene 
 may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).</p><p>
 6 bexarotene may potentially enhance the action of insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones), resulting in hypoglycaemia (see section 
 4.4).</p><p>
 laboratory test interactions ca125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuated with bexarotene therapy.</p><p>
 food interactions in all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take targretin capsules with or immediately following a meal. in one clinical study, plasma bexarotene auc and c
 max values were substantially higher following the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the administration of a 
 glucose solution. because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based upon administration 
 with food, it is recommended that targretin capsules be administered with food.</p><p>
 on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4, grapefruit juice may 
 theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data from the use of bexarotene in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity. based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures to bexarotene, 
 a margin of safety for human teratogenicity has not been demonstrated (see section 5.3). bexarotene is 
 contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 if this medicinal product is used inadvertently during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant 
 while taking this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus.</p><p>
 contraception in males and females 
 women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth-control measures when bexarotene is used. 
 a negative, sensitive, pregnancy test (e.g. serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, beta-hcg) 
 should be obtained within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. effective contraception must be used 
 from the time of the negative pregnancy test through the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at 
 least one month following discontinuation of therapy. whenever contraception is required, it is 
 recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously. bexarotene can 
 potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of 
 oestroprogestative contraceptives (see section 4.5). thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a 
 woman with childbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal contraceptive method is also 
 recommended. male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or may 
 potentially become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and 
 for at least one month after the last dose.</p><p>
 breast-feeding 
 it is unknown whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk. bexarotene should not be used in 
 breast-feeding mothers.</p><p>
 fertility 
 there are no human data on the effect of bexarotene on fertility. in male dogs, some effects have been 
 documented (see section 5.3). effects on fertility cannot be excluded.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. however, dizziness and visual difficulties have been reported in patients taking targretin. patients who 
 experience dizziness or visual difficulties during therapy must not drive or operate machinery.</p><p>
 7</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profile</p><p>
 the safety of bexarotene has been examined in clinical studies of 193 patients with ctcl who 
 received bexarotene for up to 118 weeks and in 420 non-ctcl cancer patients in other studies.</p><p>
 in 109 patients with ctcl treated at the recommended initial dose of 300 mg/m
 2/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions to targretin were hyperlipaemia ((primarily elevated 
 triglycerides) 74%), hypothyroidism (29%), hypercholesterolaemia (28%), headache (27%), 
 leucopenia (20%), pruritus (20%), asthenia (19%), rash (16%), exfoliative dermatitis (15%), and pain 
 (12%).</p><p>

 the majority of adverse reactions were noted at a higher incidence at doses greater than 
 300 mg/m
 2/day. generally, these resolved without sequelae on dose reduction or withdrawal of treatment. however, among a total of 810 patients, including those without malignancy, treated with 
 bexarotene, there were three serious adverse reactions with fatal outcome (acute pancreatitis, subdural 
 haematoma and liver failure). of these, liver failure, subsequently determined to be not related to 
 bexarotene, was the only one to occur in a ctcl patient.</p><p>
 hypothyroidism generally occurs 4-8 weeks after commencement of therapy. it may be asymptomatic 
 and responds to treatment with thyroxine and resolves upon withdrawal of treatment.</p><p>
 bexarotene has a different adverse reaction profile to other oral, non-retinoid x receptor 
 (rxr)-selective retinoids. owing to its primarily rxr-binding activity, bexarotene is less likely to 
 cause mucocutaneous, nail, and hair toxicities; arthralgia; and myalgia; which are frequently reported 
 with retinoic acid receptor (rar) -binding agents.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions</p><p>
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in appendix v.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>no clinical experience with an overdose of targretin has been reported. any overdose should be treated with supportive care for the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.</p><p>

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 bexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and 
 activation of the three rxrs: 
 α, β, and γ. once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin 
 sensitisation. the ability of the rxrs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are 
 important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene 
 are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the rars.</p><p>
 in vitro, bexarotene inhibits the growth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic and squamous cell origin. 
 in vivo, bexarotene causes tumour regression in some animal models and prevents tumour induction in others.</p><p>however, the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of 
 cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) is unknown.</p><p>
 clinical results</p><p>
 bexarotene capsules were evaluated in clinical trials of 193 patients with ctcl of whom 93 had 
 advanced stage disease refractory to prior systemic therapy. among the 61 patients treated at an initial 
 dose of 300 mg/m
 2/day, the overall response rate, according to a global assessment by the physician, was 51% (31/61) with a clinical complete response rate of 3%. responses were also determined by a 
 composite score of five clinical signs (surface area, erythema, plaque elevation, scaling and 
 hypo/hyperpigmentation) which also considered all extracutaneous ctcl manifestations. the overall 
 response rate according to this composite assessment was 31% (19/61) with a clinical complete 
 response rate of 7% (4/61)
 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption</p><p>
 absorption/dose proportionality: pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m2. terminal elimination half-life values were generally between one and three hours. following repeat once daily 
 dose administration at dose levels 
 ≥ 230 mg/m2, cmax and auc in some patients were less than respective single dose values. no evidence of prolonged accumulation was observed. at the 
 recommended initial daily-dose level (300 mg/m
 2), single-dose and repeated daily-dose bexarotene pharmacokinetic parameters were similar.</p><p>
 distribution</p><p>
 protein binding/distribution: bexarotene is highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. the uptake of bexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated.</p><p> 
 biotransformation</p><p>
 metabolism: bexarotene metabolites in plasma include 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. 
 in vitro studies suggest glucuronidation as a metabolic pathway, and that cytochrome p450 3a4 is the major cytochrome p450 isozyme responsible for formation of the 
 oxidative metabolites. based on the 
 in vitro binding and the retinoid receptor activation profile of the metabolites, and on the relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have 
 little impact on the pharmacological profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.</p><p>
 11 elimination</p><p>excretion: neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. the estimated renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute. renal excretion is not a 
 significant elimination pathway for bexarotene.</p><p>
 pharmacokinetics in special populations age:</p><p>based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 343 patients aged &lt; 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene 
 pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 body weight and gender: based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body 
 weight. gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 race: based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 caucasian and 44 black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in blacks and caucasians.</p><p>there are insufficient 
 data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>bexarotene is not genotoxic. carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. fertility studies have not been conducted; however, in sexually immature male dogs, reversible aspermatogenesis (28-day 
 study) and testicular degeneration (91-day study) were seen. when bexarotene was administered for 
 six months to sexually mature dogs, no testicular effects were seen. effects on fertility cannot be 
 excluded. bexarotene, in common with the majority of retinoids, was teratogenic and embryotoxic in 
 an animal test species at systemic exposures that are achievable clinically in humans. irreversible 
 cataracts involving the posterior area of the lens occurred in rats and dogs treated with bexarotene at

 targretin capsules are used by patients with advanced stage cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) 
 whose disease has not responded to other therapies. ctcl is a condition in which certain cells of the 
 body’s lymph system called t-lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you take targretin 
  
 do not take targretin:</header><p>- if you are allergic to bexarotene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
 6). 
 -</p><p>if you are pregnant or breast feeding or if you can become pregnant and are not using effective 
 birth control measures. 
 -</p><p>if you have a history of pancreatitis, have uncontrolled lipid (blood fats) elevations (high blood 
 cholesterol or high blood triglycerides), have a condition known as hypervitaminosis a, have 
 uncontrolled thyroid disease, have insufficient liver function or have an ongoing systemic 
 infection.</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>talk to your doctor before taking targretin -</p><p>if you have a known hypersensitivity to retinoids (related to vitamin a), suffer from liver 
 disease, have high blood lipids or take medicines which may cause high blood lipids, have 
 uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), have had gall bladder or biliary tract disease, or 
 consume excessive amounts of alcohol. 
 -</p><p>if you have ever had any mental health problems including depression, aggressive tendencies or 
 mood changes. this is because taking targretin may affect your mood. 
 your fasting blood lipid determinations may have to be performed before therapy is initiated and at 
 weekly intervals afterwards, and then monthly while taking this medicine. 
 21</p><p>blood tests to evaluate the function of your liver and thyroid gland and to monitor your red blood cell and white blood cell counts will be obtained before therapy is started and will be monitored during 
 therapy.</p><p>
 periodic eye exams may be needed if you experience visual difficulties while taking this medicine.</p><p>
 minimise exposure to sunlight as much as possible and avoid exposure to sun lamps.</p><p>
 do not take more than 15,000 international units of vitamin a supplements per day during treatment.</p><p>
 mental health problems 
 you may not notice some changes in your mood and behaviour and so it is very important that you tell 
 your friends and family that this medicine could affect your mood and behaviour. they may notice 
 these changes and help you identify any problems that you need to talk to your doctor about.</p></section><section><header>children and adolescents</header><p>targretin capsules should not be used in children or adolescents.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and targretin</header><p>tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, such as • ketoconazole and itraconazole (used against fungal infections), • erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin (used against bacterial infections), • phenytoin and phenobarbital (used against seizures), • gemfibrozil (used to reduce high levels of fats in the blood such as triglycerides and cholesterol), 
 • vitamin a supplements, protease inhibitors (used against viral infections), • tamoxifen (used against some forms of cancer), • dexamethasone (used for inflammatory conditions), • insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion, or insulin-sensitisers (used against diabetes mellitus).</p><p>

 27</p></section><section><header>annex iv scientific conclusions</header><p>28</p></section><section><header>scientific conclusions</header><p>on 7 july 2016 the united kingdom triggered a referral under article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the prac to review the routine risk 
 minimisation measures in place for the oral and topical retinoids to ensure the available data and the 
 risks associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders are accurately and 
 consistently addressed within the product information where appropriate and justified by data. 
 furthermore, the prac was requested to review any additional risk minimisation measures to ensure 
 that these are optimal in terms of provision of information and delivery of effective risk management 
 that is subject to appropriate monitoring. the prac was requested to assess the impact of the above 
 concerns on the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-containing medicinal products and issue a 
 recommendation on whether the products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
 after reviewing all the available data to address the concerns discussed, the prac adopted a 
 recommendation on 8 february 2018 which was then considered by the chmp, in accordance with 
 article 107k of directive 2001/83/ec.</p></section><section><header>overall summary of the scientific evaluation by the prac</header><p>the prac reviewed all available data from pre-clinical studies, pharmacovigilance data, published literature and spontaneous reports on the risks associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and 
 neuropsychiatric disorders of oral and topical retinoids. in addition, the views of patients and 
 healthcare professionals regarding communication, awareness and understanding of the risks of 
 retinoids during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential were taken into account in the 
 recommendation along with their views on options for improving risk communication. 
 the review confirms the already known teratogenic risks associated with the use of oral retinoids in 
 pregnant women. the data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is more strongly 
 associated with the oral retinoids than the topical retinoids. the animal reproductive toxicity data for 
 the oral retinoids demonstrate a typical pattern of retinoid embryopathy. the human data on congenital 
 malformations after oral retinoid exposure show a significant risk of retinoid embryopathy (of up to 
 30% of fetuses exposed); furthermore it is known that approximately one-third of pregnant patients 
 exposed to oral retinoids during pregnancy will have spontaneous abortions. pregnancy is an absolute 
 contraindication for all oral retinoids in the eu. 
 the prac noted that despite the introduction of pregnancy prevention measures, including pregnancy 
 prevention programmes (ppps), cases of pregnancy during treatment with oral retinoid continue to be 
 reported in the eu. 
 compliance with the ppp is crucial to a positive benefit/risk balance for these products; therefore, the 
 adequacy of the pregnancy prevention measures, including ppps, for the oral retinoids acitretin, 
 alitretinoin and isotretinoin has been reviewed to ensure that the available materials effectively 
 encourage contraception use, regular pregnancy testing and shared responsibility between patients, 
 doctors and pharmacists in adhering to recommendations, and that this is communicated consistently 
 and effectively for all products. furthermore, specific studies to measure effectiveness of the agreed 
 changes to the ppp have been imposed on the marketing authorisation holders as an outcome of the 
 referral. 
 in this respect, the prac recommended amendments to the product information, including 
 harmonising the warnings and precautions of use for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin to reflect the teratogenic risk associated with their use and communication to healthcare 
 professionals through a direct healthcare professional communication. in addition, the prac 
 recommended changes to the educational materials for the oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin) to ensure healthcare professionals and patients are informed about the risks associated 
 with oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin) in pregnant women and women of child-
 29 bearing potential and on the measures necessary to minimise the risk. these include a patient reminder card, physician checklist/acknowledgement form and pharmacist checklist ensuring the understanding 
 and the awareness of prescribers and patients on the risks. the prac has also recommended that 
 educational materials be distributed via electronic channels such as qr codes, and websites to make 
 better use of the existing technology bearing in mind the young patient population using these 
 products.</p><p>the prac acknowledged that the implementation of the following elements of the ppp need to be 
 considered and agreed at national level to account for the different healthcare systems in the eu:</p><p>
 • the implementation of the 7-day prescription validity rule, in order not to impact on existing national legislation where 7 days validity exists; 
 • patient signature of the physician checklist/acknowledgement form; • dissemination of the patient reminder card; • pharmacist checklist; • inclusion of appointment table in the patient reminder card; • the option of a pictogram/symbol to accompany the box warning wording and to be included in the visual reminder on the outer package to warn patients about the harm to unborn baby 
 and the need for effective contraception when using the medicinal product. 
 prac considered that given the oncological indications of oral tretinoin and oral bexarotene, further 
 risk minimisation measures (rmms) for these products regarding teratogenic effects, such as 
 strengthening the product information (pi) and additional risk minimisation measures (armms) would 
 not provide an added value given the specialist management, the population at risk and the nature of 
 the illness. 
 the prac noted the systemic exposure is negligible following topical application of retinoids and that 
 this does not appear to be affected to a clinically significant degree by the severity or extent of skin 
 disease. studies that examine the effects of human pregnancy on systemic absorption of topical 
 retinoids are also lacking. however, there was a consensus that several other factors may contribute to 
 an increased systemic exposure and therefore the risk cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 given that humans are the most sensitive species with respect to retinoid toxicity and considering the 
 limitations of the available data with respect to understanding the systemic absorption and also the 
 possible risks, the prac, considers that it is appropriate to take a very precautious approach. the 
 indications for the topical retinoids are non-life-threatening and there is no absolute clinical need for 
 the treatment during pregnancy and pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing. the prac 
 thereby concludes that the benefit-risk balance of topical retinoids in pregnancy is not favourable, and 
 therefore recommends that use of topical retinoids should be contraindicated during pregnancy and in 
 women planning a pregnancy. 
 the prac recognizes that the available data in relation to oral retinoids and the occurrence of 
 neuropsychiatric disorders have a number of important limitations that preclude the establishment of a 
 clear causal association. nevertheless, the prac considers that the data from patients presented in 
 case series, spontaneous case reports and individual patients&apos; experiences are considered to be very 
 important. although the underlying risk of psychiatric disorders within the patient populations can be 
 significant, it is advisable that patients taking oral retinoids are warned about the potential risk of 
 psychiatric reactions and the signs and symptoms to look out for. therefore, the prac agrees that all 
 oral retinoids should contain a warning about the potential risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in line 
 with some key principles. the data support that for isotretinoin and alitretinoin the information in 
 section 4.4 and 4.8, of the smpc, should be in line with the agreed outcome of the 2003 art 30 referral 
 for isotretinoin.</p><p>
 30 the prac further noted the extremely limited data relating to neuropsychiatric reactions after topical administration of retinoids. given this and the negligible systemic exposure following topical no 
 further risk minimization activities are deemed necessary. 
 overall, the prac concludes that the benefit-risk balance of medicinal products containing retinoids 
 remains favourable, but that marketing authorisation(s) should be varied for both the oral and topical 
 retinoids to ensure risks associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders 
 are accurately and consistently addressed, as appropriate.</p></section><section><header>grounds for prac recommendation</header><p>whereas,</p><p>
 • the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (prac) considered the procedure under article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec for retinoid-containing medicinal products.</p><p>
 • the prac considered the totality of the data submitted, including responses from the marketing authorisation holders with regard to the consistency and effectiveness of existing routine and 
 additional risk minimisation measures for oral and topical retinoids-containing medicinal 
 products in relation to teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders. in addition, the prac 
 considered the views of patients and healthcare professionals in relation to their understanding 
 and the awareness of the teratogenic risk associated with the use of retinoid-containing medicines.</p><p>
 • with regards to the teratogenic risk, the prac confirmed that all oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin, bexarotene, isotretinoin and tretinoin) are highly teratogenic and therefore must 
 continue to be contraindicated during pregnancy or in women of child bearing potential unless 
 they are using effective contraception. given the indications and patients populations that use 
 acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin, it was considered that any use of these oral retinoids in 
 female patients at risk of pregnancy must be in accordance with the conditions of a pregnancy 
 prevention programme (ppp).</p><p>for tretinoin and bexarotene, it was considered that in light of the 
 oncological indications, specialist management in a hospital setting and population at risk that 
 existing risk minimisation was appropriate and proportionate.</p><p>
 • the prac also concluded that there was a need to further harmonise and streamline the measures in the ppp including associated educational materials for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin 
 and isotretinoin to ensure these are optimal to support discussions between patients and 
 healthcare professionals on the risks and the associated risk minimisation measures.</p><p>
 • the prac further considered that for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin a drug utilisation study with a complementary survey should be conducted to assess the 
 effectiveness of the proposed updated risk minimisation measures.</p><p>
 • a direct healthcare professional communication (dhpc) was also considered appropriate for all oral and topical retinoids.</p><p>
 • with regards to the teratogenic risk of topical retinoids (adapalene, alitretinoin, isotretinoin, tretinoin and tazarotene), the prac concluded that the data available show that after topical 
 application, systemic exposure is expected to be negligible and unlikely to result in adverse fetal 
 outcomes. however, given that humans are the most sensitive species to retinoid embryopathy 
 and that several other factors may contribute to an increased systemic exposure, such as excessive 
 use and damaged skin barrier, the prac agreed that the teratogenic risk cannot be completely 
 excluded. the prac therefore recommended that the use of topical retinoids should be 
 contraindicated during pregnancy and in women planning a pregnancy given the non-life 
 threatening nature of the indications. 
 31 • with regards to neuropsychiatric disorders, the prac noted the limitations of the available data and considered that a clear causal relationship could not be established with the oral retinoids. 
 however, taking into account the target patient population, the prac recognised the possible 
 underlying risk of psychiatric disorders, and therefore recommended some changes to the product 
 information such as warnings and precautions and so that the current level of available evidence 
 is appropriately reflected.</p><p>
 • furthermore, the prac noted the extremely limited data relating to neuropsychiatric reactions after topical administration of retinoids. given this and the negligible systemic exposure 
 following topical use, the prac considered that no further risk minimization activities are 
 deemed necessary.</p><p>
 in view of the above, the prac considers that the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-containing 
 medicinal products remains favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information 
 and risk management plan, the conditions to the marketing authorisations and the related 
 communication. 
 the prac, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
 for retinoid-containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>chmp opinion</header><p>having reviewed the prac recommendation, the chmp agrees with the prac overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
 the chmp clarified that the communication plan should be modified to say ‘healthcare professionals 
 who may be involved in the management of patients treated with retinoids’.</p></section><section><header>overall conclusion</header><p>the chmp, as a consequence, considers that the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-containing medicinal products remains favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information and risk
