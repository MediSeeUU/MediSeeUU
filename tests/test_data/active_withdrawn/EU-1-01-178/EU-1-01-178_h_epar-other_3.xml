 bexarotene and insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion or insulin-sensitisers. information about this 
 interaction is currently mentioned in section 4.4 of the smpc, but should also be mentioned in section 
 4.5 of the smpc in line with the guideline on summary of product characteristics.

 enhancing insulin secretion or insulin-sensitisers, the prac considered that changes to the product
