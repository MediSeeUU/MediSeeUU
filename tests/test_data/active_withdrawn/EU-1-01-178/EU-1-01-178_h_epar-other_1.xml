 information on the procedure</header><p>on 7 july 2016 the united kingdom triggered a referral under article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the prac to review the routine risk minimisation 
 in place for the oral and topical retinoids to ensure the available data and the risks associated with the 
 adverse teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders are accurately and consistently addressed 
 within the product information where appropriate and justified by data. furthermore, the prac was 
 requested to review any additional risk minimisation measures to ensure that these are optimal in 
 terms of provision of information and delivery of effective risk management that is subject to 
 appropriate monitoring. the prac was requested to assess the impact of the above concerns on the 
 benefit-risk balance of retinoid-containing medicinal products and issue a recommendation on whether 
 the products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
 after reviewing all the available data to address the concerns discussed, the prac adopted its 
 recommendation on 8 february 2018 that will be sent to the committee for medicinal products for 
 human use (chmp).</p></section><section><header n="2">2.  
 scientific discussion</header></section><section><header n="2.1">2.1.  
 introduction</header><p>retinoids are natural or synthetic vitamin a derivatives with pleiotropic effects that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. first-generation retinoids include retinol tretinoin (all-trans-
 retinoic acid) isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid). second-generation 
 retinoids also known as aromatic retinoids were created by alteration of the cyclic end group and 
 include acitretin. third-generation retinoids contain further modifications and are called arotinoids. 
 members of this generation include tazarotene and bexarotene. adapalene a derivative of naphthoic 
 acid with retinoid-like properties does not fit precisely into any of the three generations.</p><p>
 pregnancy is an absolute contraindication in the smpcs for all oral retinoids in the eu. a referral in 
 2003 for isotretinoin led to introduction of a pregnancy prevention programme (ppp) in the eu. since 
 the introduction of the ppp for isotretinoin similar programmes have been introduced for the other oral 
 retinoids used to treat dermatological conditions. the effectiveness of these ppps has been kept under 
 close review and although a reduction in the number of pregnancies exposed to these retinoids has 
 been observed cases of pregnancies exposed to retinoids continue to occur.</p><p>
 in january 2016, in the context of a periodic safety update report single assessment (psusa) 
 procedure, the prac raised concerns about how the requirements of the ppp are followed in clinical 
 practice, identifying areas that may impact on the effectiveness of the ppp. consequently, the prac 
 identified a need for a detailed assessment of compliance with the requirements of the ppp for 
 isotretinoin. subsequent discussions in the context of the psusas for erythromycin plus isotretinoin 
 topical gels and of acitretin have also highlighted that there are concerns about the consistency and 
 effectiveness of existing risk minimisation measures for these products. 
 information was gathered from ncas through a non-urgent request for information (nui) showing</p><p>
 that the majority but not all topical retinoids include a contraindication for use during pregnancy and 
 that there are inconsistencies between products with the same active substance, between oral and 
 topical retinoids products and between member states (ms) as to the extent of the warnings and the 
 risk minimisation measures in place for pregnancy prevention, confirmed the need to review product 
 information and risk minimisation measures across the retinoid class to ensure those are accurately 
 and consistently addressed within the product information.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 4/29</p><p>
 with regard to the possible risk of neuropsychiatric disorders with retinoids the extent to which the association is attributable and the magnitude of any risk is unclear. new evidence has been evaluated 
 as it has become available and, although subject to extensive reviews at ms level, it has not been 
 subject to formal review at eu level since 2006. the product information (pi) for isotretinoin reflects a 
 potential risk of neuropsychiatric disorders and highlighting the need for patients to be monitored. 
 however, there are differences in the extent and the nature of warnings about neuropsychiatric 
 reactions that exist within the isotretinoin product information. other oral retinoids have similarly been 
 associated with neuropsychiatric reactions and it would be important to consider whether appropriate 
 warnings in the product information are provided for all retinoids and whether any additional risk 
 minimisation measures are required. 
 consequently, on 7 july 2016 the united kingdom triggered a referral under article 31 of directive 
 2001/83/ec resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the prac to review the routine risk 
 minimisation in place for the oral and topical retinoids to assess the impact of the above concerns on 
 the benefit-risk balance of these products and issue a recommendation on whether their marketing 
 authorisation should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.

 risk minimisation measures for oral and topical retinoid containing medicinal products in relation to adverse teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders. in addition, prac considered the views of 
 patients and healthcare professionals for the understanding and the awareness of the teratogenic risk 
 associated with the use of retinoid-containing medicines. the following report summarises the most 
 relevant data.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.  
 clinical aspects</header></section><section><header n="2.3">2.3.  
 data on efficacy</header><p>the efficacy of oral and topical retinoids in their authorised indication(s) has been well established and is detailed in each product information. the aim of this referral procedure was specifically to address 
 questions related to the safety of retinoid containing medicines and no questions were asked in relation 
 to the efficacy of these products. no new efficacy data have been provided for this referral procedure 
 by the mahs and no efficacy concerns arose from the assessment of the data presented.</p></section><section><header n="2.4">2.4.  
 data on safety</header></section><section><header n="2.4.1">2.4.1.  
 teratogenic effects – oral retinoids</header><p>the teratogenic effects of oral vitamin a derivatives are well established (nau h., at al (2001)) and patients treated with these drugs may include women of child-bearing potential (wcbp) (lipson ah, at 
 al. (1993). retinoic acid embryopathy include central nervous system abnormalities (hydrocephalus, 
 microcephaly), external ear abnormalities (anotia, microtia or absent external auditory meatus), 
 cardiovascular abnormalities (septal wall and aortic defects), facial dysmorphia (cleft palate), eye 
 abnormalities (microphthalmia), thymus gland and bone abnormalities (lipson ah, at al. (1993). 
 the data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is more strongly associated with the 
 oral retinoids than the topical retinoids (raguideau, f., at al. (2015)). animal reproductive toxicity data 
 for the oral retinoids demonstrate a typical pattern of retinoid embryopathy (johnson em., at al 
 (1997)). human data on congenital malformations after oral retinoid exposure shows a significant risk 
 of retinoid embryopathy (of up to 30% of foetuses exposed); furthermore it is known that 
 approximately one-third of pregnant patients will undergo spontaneous abortions (nau h., at al 
 (2001)). pregnancy is an absolute contraindication for all oral retinoids in the eu.</p><p>in 2003, as a conclusion to an article 30 of directive 2001/83/ec referral, it was agreed that oral 
 isotretinoin should only be prescribed to wcbp under strict pregnancy prevention measures supported 
 by a pregnancy prevention programme (ppp). pregnancy prevention measures, including pregnancy 
 prevention programmes have been implemented by marketing authorisation holders of different oral 
 retinoids products, albeit inconsistently and with different levels of information.</p><p>
 despite the introduction of ppps for some products, cases of pregnancy during treatment with oral 
 retinoids continue to be reported in the eu. several studies have considered the effectiveness of the 
 ppp for isotretinoin and several publications describe poor compliance particularly with the pregnancy 
 testing and use of contraception (crijns, h. j., et al. (2012); veyries, m. (2015); henry, d., et al. 
 (2016)).</p><p> 
 concerning acitretin, a cohort study (raguideau, f., et al. (2015)) conducted in france between 2007 
 and 2012 also highlighted concerns about poor compliance with pregnancy testing requirements for 
 acitretin.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 6/29</p><p>
 the number of pregnancies since the date of first marketing, as presented by the mahs, was assessed cumulatively and respectively as follows: 
 • acitretin: 442 pregnancy cases (132 related to conception during treatment, 260 after completing treatment);</p><p>• alitretinoin: 17 pregnancy cases (12 related to conception during treatment, 4 more than one month after stopping treatment);</p><p>• isotretinoin: 7968 pregnancy cases from all sources (the majority of cases from usa). these data however are considered to be largely underestimated because of the limitations of the 
 pharmacovigilance system which is not designed to collect pregnancy occurrence.</p><p>
 unfortunately the majority of cases reporting malformations lack information regarding contraceptive 
 measures, which makes it difficult to assess patient adherence to recommendations.</p><p>
 compliance with the ppp is crucial to a positive benefit/risk balance for these products in women of 
 child-bearing potential; therefore, the adequacy of the existing pregnancy prevention measures for the 
 oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin has been reviewed in order to ensure that the 
 available materials effectively encourage use of contraception, regular pregnancy testing and shared 
 responsibility between patients, doctors and pharmacists in adhering to recommendations, and that 
 this is done consistently and effectively for all products. further consideration has also been given to 
 the package labelling to reinforce key messages. furthermore, specific studies to measure 
 effectiveness of the agreed changes to the ppp have been imposed on the marketing authorisation 
 holders as an outcome of the referral. 
 considering the particular oncological indications of oral tretinoin and oral bexarotene, further risk 
 minimisation measure (rmm) for these products regarding teratogenic effects might be seen as an 
 extra and unnecessary burden for patients and healthcare professional (hcps). for these particular 
 populations, strengthening the product information (pi) and additional risk minimisation measure 
 (armm) would not provide an added value given the specialist management, the population at risk and 
 the nature of the illness. in particular, oral tretinoin is used in the context of a life-threatening illness 
 that will be subject to specialist care in the hospital setting and oral bexarotene is indicated for use in a 
 patient population that is generally not of reproductive age.</p></section><section><header>adequacy of existing ppp and proposals for updates</header><p>pregnancy prevention programme (ppp) materials, which clearly convey the risks and the importance of strict adherence to the pregnancy prevention measures, are essential to reinforce the 
 communication between hcp and patients. real patient engagement and consequently greater 
 compliance with the ppp can only be achieved with a clear exchange of information. 
 where oral retinoids currently have ppps, the ppp materials are known to be inconsistent between the 
 different active substances and also between products containing the same active substance. to this 
 effect, prac agreed that the material should be simplified and harmonised across active substances 
 and be tailored to each type of recipient, i.e. patients, physicians and pharmacists, and include the 
 following set of key messages: 
 a.</p><p>teratogenicity risk – what it means to the unborn fetus; 
 b.</p><p>contraception – understanding the ‘risk period’, and what measures need to be observed 
 during this risk period; 
 c.</p><p>pregnancy testing – why this is important, and why ideally 30-day prescriptions are required.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 7/29</p><p>
 the patients and healthcare professionals consulted during the procedure indicated that specialists managing patients who take oral retinoids are experienced in the use of these products. it was 
 therefore agreed that the materials should be simplified with the key objective of best supporting 
 discussions without providing unnecessary information that physicians are already aware of or can 
 access from other sources such as the smpc.</p><p>
 some key components of the ppp and the different elements of the additional risk minimisation 
 measures, including a discussion on the use of different electronic dissemination channels, are 
 presented below:</p></section><section><header>30-day prescription requirement</header><p>the aim of this referral procedure was to enhance compliance with the ppp to guarantee patient safety, however, it is recognized that any obligations of the ppp need to be workable in clinical practice and in 
 this respect need to provide for an element of clinical discretion based on the individual circumstances 
 of the wcbp. the ppp conditions should also be practicable in relation to the different ms healthcare 
 system practices. the importance of this was reinforced through the consultation with the hcp and 
 patient stakeholder group who considered that restrictive conditions such as those of the ipledge ppp 
 for isotretinoin in the usa should be avoided.</p><p>
 several elements of the ppp such as the feasibility of monthly follow-up visits, monthly medically 
 supervised pregnancy testing, the limitation of the prescription to a 30-day supply and the 7-day 
 prescription validity, are known to be a challenge in some ms. furthermore, the differences in ms 
 healthcare systems will greatly influence how viable it is to implement each of these conditions. lastly, 
 the woman’s individual circumstances also need to be evaluated in order to determine the optimal 
 approach to follow-up and monitoring. therefore, whilst it was recognised that there should be regular 
 follow-up, which ideally should be on a monthly basis, there may be situations where this is not 
 absolutely essential (e.g. wcbp who is established on a highly effective form of contraception such as 
 an implant or intrauterine device). therefore, it was considered that the conditions of the ppp should 
 provide an element of clinical discretion with regards to the prescription duration according to the 
 patient&apos;s situation and risk of becoming pregnant. 
 in order to minimize the risk for the unborn child it is crucial to detect an eventual pregnancy under 
 treatment as early as possible and this can only be achieved if pregnancy tests are performed 
 regularly. consequently, follow-up visits should be arranged at regular intervals, and to support this 
 regular follow-up, the prescription duration should ideally be limited to 30 days but it is recognized that 
 flexibility might be necessary.</p></section><section><header n="7">7 day-prescription validity</header><p>the 7-day prescription validity was introduced as a result of the 2003 isotretinoin art. 30 referral. the original intention of this was to encourage patients to obtain their prescription in a timely manner so 
 that the results of the pregnancy test remained valid and that dispensing occurred as close as possible 
 to such testing.</p><p>
 healthcare professionals and several ms have highlighted that this measure could not always be 
 ensured at pharmacy level; moreover imposing 7 days may not be in line with the national legal 
 validity of medical prescriptions in some ms.</p><p>
 it is essential that the initial pregnancy test is performed correctly to exclude a pregnancy and that 
 contraception is initiated immediately thereafter; the initiation of retinoid treatment immediately after</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 8/29</p><p>
 the pregnancy test however is not critical. any measures in this respect need to be practicable, considering the possible differences between member state healthcare systems and legislation.</p><p>
 in light of all the above considerations, the prac was of the opinion that the product information and 
 educational materials key messages will not specify the 7 day validity of the prescription across the eu. 
 the prac acknowledged, however, the differences between healthcare systems in the eu, where in 
 some member states the 7 days validity rule is already in place.</p><p>prac was of the opinion that national 
 provisions different than the pi and the educational material key messages could be retained, subject 
 to the nca scrutiny.</p></section><section><header>two forms of contraception</header><p>the requirement for two forms of contraception was discussed during the referral and it was considered whether taking further measures to strengthen the requirements of the ppp in this respect 
 would necessarily lead to enhanced compliance. it was stressed that individual circumstances should 
 always be evaluated in each case. additionally, it was recognized that imposing two forms of 
 contraception may not have the desired effect as two methods with poor compliance (e.g. condom with 
 chc) are by definition not safer than appropriate use of one highly effective method (e.g. intra-uterine 
 device). therefore, the prac agreed that a user-independent method such as an implant or an 
 intrauterine device is the preferred contraceptive option and that updates to the smpc and pl and 
 educational materials were required to clarify this.</p></section><section><header>medically supervised pregnancy testing</header><p>the first pregnancy test, prior to the first prescription needs to be medically supervised. thereafter, where indicated, follow-up pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the 
 prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. this allows for appropriate clinical 
 discretion but guarantees that patients will get their prescription in a timely way in order that the 
 results of the pregnancy test remain valid. 
 a pregnancy test needs to be performed at a specified time period following the end of treatment, 
 which is determined based on the metabolism of the product and is one month for alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin and 3 years for acitretin.</p></section><section><header>educational materials</header><p>the following table presents the agreed changes to the documents constituting the ppp educational materials (em) (please see enclosure 5):</p></section><section><header>previous educational materials

 b) to instruct patients not to share

 *the implementation of the pharmacist checklist will be left at the discretion of the ms.</p><p> patient reminder card (prc) a patient reminder card will be required with the ultimate goal of supporting discussions at the level of prescribing and dispensing, thereby improving adherence to the ppp. the prac and stakeholders 
 discussed in particular the content, placement and distribution of the prc to achieve this goal. there 
 was no consensus from the stakeholders on that point. the card given by the prescriber will act as an 
 useful reminder of the key elements of the discussions. having the prc given with each package would 
 guarantee that every patient receives a card and placing it on the outside of the pack means it could 
 be easily removed and therefore could also support the discussion with the pharmacist at the time of 
 dispensing. however, in itself this does not guarantee that it is seen and read by the patient as it 
 cannot be guaranteed that the patient will read the pl</p><p>or prc. also, having the card on the outside of 
 the package will mean that patients receive multiple cards with every new package, even if they are 
 not the target population, such as men or women with no chance to get pregnant.</p><p>
 the prc brings together all the relevant information for the patient and will be of a small size, allowing 
 it to be carried by the patient on a daily basis.</p><p>
 the provision of the prc to patients (e.g. by the physician, inside the pack, outside the pack, the 
 method of dissemination etc.) should ensure that this material supports clear discussions about the 
 treatment. in light of different healthcare practices across the eu, the prac agreed that these aspects 
 of the implementation in each ms is to be determined by the respective competent authority. the</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 10/29</p><p>
 agreements at national level should always be made with the aforementioned goal in mind of how best to support hcp-patient discussion.</p><p>
 the utility of including an appointment table in the prc was discussed, with stakeholders questioned 
 on this point. there was no consensus from the stakeholders on that point. although it was noted to be 
 of potential use by some, it was also mentioned that in some ms appointments are made via texts and 
 phone calls. in view of these reflections, the prac concluded that the decision to include an 
 appointment table to register dates and test results should be left at the discretion of the national 
 competent authority taking due consideration of the existing local practices. 
 prescriber and pharmacist checklists the materials for hcps (physician and pharmacist) in the form of checklists are designed to enhance conversation with the patients and understanding of the ppp requirements, and increase the level of 
 engagement with the ppp. the materials also serve as a reminder to align hcp involvement and focus 
 on patient&apos;s compliance.</p><p>
 the key elements of the physician checklist were agreed by the prac (please see enclosure 5); 
 however, the decision as to whether or not the checklist should include a signature should be left to 
 the discretion of ms in order to account for the differences in healthcare practices across the eu. the 
 physician checklist/acknowledgement form will be easily recorded and accessible in the patient files for 
 future reference.</p><p>
 the pharmacist checklist is common to all oral retinoids with a ppp in place; its implementation is to be 
 agreed by each relevant competent authority.</p></section><section><header>distribution of educational materials</header><p>materials should be available both in paper and electronically.</p><p>website/url the benefits of having the ppp materials available online are generally acknowledged, and some mahs already use their own websites to provide product information, but the amount of information provided 
 differs between mahs.</p><p>
 although there is no existing legal framework to enable the prac to impose the development of a 
 common website, the prac strongly recommends that a common website be created which would 
 contain the ppp materials for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin. this would help to 
 keep the pregnancy prevention message consistent across all products and prevent any confusion from 
 differences in individual mah materials.</p><p>
 qr code</p><p>quick response (qr) codes are a type of 2d matrix barcode. qr codes can be scanned by devices such as smart phones and can be used as a quick link to urls, images, music or videos. article 62 of 
 directive 2001/83/ec allows for the inclusion of qr codes for the purpose of providing information to 
 patients. the qr code could be included on either the outer packaging or on the package leaflet.</p><p>
 the prac recognises that there are some limitations to the use of qr codes, such as their use by some 
 demographics of the general population (e.g. elderly) and the potential for confusion, and space 
 implications on packaging, with the 2d matrix code on the outer packaging for verification of the 
 authenticity of medicines in the supply chain required as part of the falsified medicines directive 
 (directive 2011/62/eu).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 11/29</p><p>
 in spite of these limitations, if the ppp materials are available via a common website then the use of a qr code to link to the ppp materials is supported by the prac. to overcome the issues related to the 
 2d matrix code the package leaflet is considered to be the most appropriate place for the qr code to 
 be included. the url of the corresponding website should also be included for patients without the 
 means to scan a qr code.</p></section><section><header>visual reminder (boxed warning/pictogram/symbol)</header><p>a warning on the outer box (boxed warning) may be more easily understood than a symbol/pictogram alone. the use of boxed warnings in the smpc, pl and the outer packaging is therefore recommended 
 to guarantee the reinforcement of important messages regarding the teratogenic effects associated 
 with the use of acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin; the need to use effective contraception, and the 
 strict contraindication in pregnancy (please refer to attachment 1, 
 amendments to the product information as recommended by the prac
 ).</p><p> the matter of including a symbol/pictogram on the packaging of medicines known to be teratogenic is 
 one that has generated a wealth of debate across multiple regulatory procedures. 
 there are several points in favour of the use of a pictogram in relation to the risk of teratogenicity:</p><p>
 • highlighting the risk to all patients, even before reading the pl;</p><p>• reminding the hcp about the need to inform that the product is teratogenic; and • may encourage the patient to look for additional information about the risk, including through questions to relevant hcps.</p><p>
 in the context of this referral, the usefulness of a striking and visual reminder of the risk was 
 acknowledged during the stakeholder meeting. 
 however, the use of a pictogram also carries the risk of misinterpretation and that the intended 
 message may not be adequately conveyed. in relation to the message regarding the teratogenic risk, 
 the prac agrees that a pictogram alone cannot convey all the necessary information, such as the use 
 of effective contraception and the need to avoid use during pregnancy. to guarantee a full 
 understanding of the potential chosen pictogram/symbol, it would be important to accompany it with a 
 brief explanatory text. 
 from a regulatory standpoint it is important to ensure that any pictogram is appropriately understood 
 and has been subject to user testing.</p><p>
 in view of the available evidence from studies conducted specifically to test pregnancy warnings on 
 medication packaging, the prac recommends that the validated boxed warning text may be 
 accompanied by a symbol for the visual reminder and this should be included on the outer packaging 
 for oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin).</p><p>
 the decision to implement a symbol/pictogram on the outer package in addition to the minimum visual 
 text reminder (as above), and its graphic content should be taken at national level, considering cultural 
 differences and national preferences on the implementation of symbol /pictogram and input from local 
 patient representatives.</p></section><section><header>studies to measure the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures</header><p>regarding the monitoring of the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures, and recognising the limitations with regards to the data recorded in healthcare databases, a drug utilisation study

 the study design should aim to evaluate and quantify the effectiveness of the rmm, and should include a pre- and post-implementation analysis and assessment. the mahs are highly encouraged to 
 collaborate in conducting this study. the protocols should be submitted for assessment by the prac 
 within 3 months after commission decision. the results of the survey and of the dus should be 
 submitted within 48 months from commission decision. the mahs are highly encouraged to 
 collaborate in conducting this study conducted according to an agreed protocol 
 in accordance with the article 23 of the regulation (ec) no 726/2004, the products should therefore 
 be included in the list of products for additional monitoring. the black symbol with the corresponding 
 explanatory statement should be included in the product information of the products.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.2">2.4.2.  
 teratogenic effects – topical retinoids</header><p>during the procedure data to evaluate the systemic absorption of topical retinoids was assessed. this evaluation considered the available data in relation to impact of the extent and severity of skin 
 disease, and the physiological changes associated with human pregnancy and in particular changes in 
 skin blood flow. 
 based on the limited data available the prac concluded that the systemic absorption of topical 
 retinoids is negligible and this is not affected to a clinically significant degree by the severity or extent 
 of skin disease. studies that examine the effects of human pregnancy on systemic absorption of topical 
 retinoids are also lacking. however, there was a consensus that several other factors may contribute to 
 an increased systemic exposure and therefore this cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 given that humans are the most sensitive species with respect to retinoid toxicity and considering the 
 limitations of the available data with respect to understanding of systemic absorption and also the 
 possible risks, it is appropriate to take a very precautious approach. the indications for the topical 
 retinoids are non-life-threatening and there is no absolute clinical need for the treatment during 
 pregnancy and it is important that pregnancy is excluded before prescribing.</p><p>
 considering the above, the prac considered that the balance of benefits and risks of topical retinoids 
 in pregnancy is not favourable, and therefore recommended that use of topical retinoids should be 
 contraindicated during pregnancy and in women planning a pregnancy. the smpc and package leaflet 
 should be updated accordingly (see attachment 1) to ensure the available data and the risks 
 associated with the teratogenic risk are accurately and consistently addressed within the product 
 information.</p><p>
 the wording proposed by the prac should be added or replaced as appropriate. repeated information 
 in other sections should be deleted. where more extensive information already exists in the smpc or 
 package leaflet, it is considered that this should be retained unless it is more restrictive or contradicts 
 the proposed wording by prac – in these cases that wording should be deleted. for clarification 
 purposes, recommending the use of effective contraception to prevent pregnancy is considered more 
 restrictive.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.  
 neuropsychiatric disorders - oral retinoids</header><p>severe skin disorders (acne, psoriasis, chronic eczema, skin neoplasms) are known to be associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, and may have a major impact on patients’ psychological 
 state, social relationships and everyday activities. 
 regarding the oral products, in some studies the authors claim that data arising from pre-clinical, 
 clinical and epidemiological data as well as data from literature reports and spontaneous reporting 
 have failed to confirm the initial signal of a possible causal relationship between isotretinoin and</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 13/29</p><p>
 psychiatric morbidity (kaymak, y., et al. (2009)). the authors also mention that these types of adverse events are reported rarely in patients receiving retinoids and there have been no consistent 
 patterns identified, except that psychiatric disorders were mainly reported in the 13-24 year-old age 
 group, which overlaps with the age of the patients receiving retinoids for acne. moreover, recent 
 studies concluded that successful treatment with oral isotretinoin was associated with an alleviation of 
 depressive symptoms (kaymak, y., et al. (2009), yesilova, y., et al. (2012), hahm, b. j., et al. 
 (2009)). 
 given the nature of the psychiatric disorder, which may lead also to suicide, the negative impact on 
 patient quality of life may be very high.</p><p>
 psychiatric disorders are very rarely reported [research report b-168’641, drug safety issue work-up 
 1998]. depression is a rarely reported side effect, while psychotic symptoms, suicide attempt and 
 suicide are very rare.</p><p>
 it is recognized that the available data have a number of important limitations that preclude the 
 establishment of a clear causal association (many spontaneous cases confounded by concomitant 
 medication and/or previous medical history of psychiatric disorders and epidemiological studies not 
 able to rule out confounding by indication).</p><p>nevertheless, the prac considered that the data from 
 patients presented in case series and spontaneous case reports and the individual patients experience 
 are considered to be very important. taking into account the target patient population and the possible 
 underlying risk of psychiatric disorders, it is advisable that patients taking oral retinoids be warned 
 about the potential risk of psychiatric reactions and the signs and symptoms to look out for. the prac 
 therefore agreed that all oral retinoids should contain a warning about the potential risk of 
 neuropsychiatric disorders. furthermore, particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of 
 depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate 
 treatment as necessary. 
 the current smpc and pl for some products already contain information that reflects the reported 
 cases. however, based on the data provided by the mahs provided during this referral or previous 
 psurs and other concerns raised by third party intervention, it was recognized that the available 
 information on the risk of psychiatric effects is not consistent across the entire class of oral retinoids. 
 in view of this situation the prac agreed that a core warning is necessary across all oral retinoids. in 
 addition it should be noted that psychotic symptoms and very rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts 
 and suicide have been reported for patients treated with isotretinoin and alitretinoin but not for 
 acitretin, bexarotene or tretinoin.</p><p>
 the available data therefore support that for the oral retinoids acitretin, bexarotene and tretinoin there 
 be a warning in section 4.4 about the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. for isotretinoin and alitretinoin 
 the available data support that information in section 4.4 and 4.8, of the smpc, should be in line with 
 the agreed outcome of the 2003 art 30 referral for isotretinoin.</p><p>
 the pi for all products containing systemic retinoids should be updated according to the wording in 
 attachment 1.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.

 eudravigilance analysis</header><p>an eudravigilance analysis was conducted to support the assessment on the neuropsychiatric disorders for the seven active substances included in this review (single or multi-ingredient formulations). a total 
 of 10,295 case reports of acitretin, adapalene, alitretinoin, bexarotene, isotretinoin, tazarotene and 
 tretinoin-containing medicinal products and any reaction in the psychiatric soc in ev was reported up 
 to 19 july 2016.</p><p>
 oral route of administration was the most frequently reported route of administration. case reports 
 tend to refer more frequently to patients of male gender. in all age groups, up until the 30-34 age 
 groups, there are more reports of male patients (the difference is greater between ages 15-29). this 
 trend inverts from the age of 35, and from then onwards female gender is always more reported, apart 
 from the age group 75-79 which has the same counts for both genders. 
 during 2010 and 2012, there was a large increase in the count of case reports with the largest peak in 
 2011 which correlates with a substantive increase in the case report from non-healthcare 
 professionals. from 2013 onwards the reporting returned to levels similar to those of</p><p>1998-2009.

 meeting with patients and healthcare professionals</header><p>a meeting with stakeholders was organised as part of the review in order to enhance interaction and exchange of information with a focus on understanding the patients’ and hcps&apos; perspective on the 
 communication, awareness and understanding of the risks of retinoids during pregnancy and in women 
 of childbearing potential and to explore their views on options for improving risk communication. a list 
 of questions to be addressed by hcps and patient representatives was adopted by the prac and a 
 meeting with a broad representation of stakeholders was organised on 3 march 2017. 
 the main feedback from the meeting is summarised below: 
 • ppp format is outdated. messages could be clearer and simpler. educational materials should be reduced and merged; 
 • use of technological advancements in communications is lacking; • message should be stronger regarding the severity of risk and options if pregnancies do occur e.g. using images showing malformation and/or a pictogram recognised across the eu to 
 identify medicines with a teratogenic risk; 
 • further strengthening the conditions of the ppp in itself would not lead to enhanced compliance; 
 • inconsistencies between ppps were highlighted but also the need to differentiate where needed (e.g. oral vs topical; isotretinoin vs acitretin with regards to duration of teratogenic risk);</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 15/29</p><p>
 • management of patients’ needs strong multi-disciplinary collaboration to enhance compliance; • understanding why and which patients fail to follow ppp will also enhance compliance; • constant reinforcement of messages is critical (currently lacking with paper-based ppp) – use outer packaging, patient cards and digital tech; 
 • on-line pharmacy highlighted as risk - retinoids are obtained online without a prescription and where ppp information is lacking; 
 • it should be reminded to young male patients not to share pills, which can lead to pregnancy. the same stakeholders were further consulted in writing during the last round of the assessment to 
 provide their views on the clarity of the message in the educational materials, and the details 
 surrounding the content and distribution logistics of the patient reminder card.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.  
 benefit-risk balance</header><p>the prac reviewed all available data from pre-clinical studies, pharmacovigilance data, published literature and spontaneous reports on the risks associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and 
 neuropsychiatric disorders of oral and topical retinoids. in addition, the views of patients and 
 healthcare professionals regarding communication, awareness and understanding of the risks of 
 retinoids during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential were taken into account in the 
 recommendation along with their views on options for improving risk communication. 
 the review confirms the already known teratogenic risks associated with the use of oral retinoids in 
 pregnant women. the data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is more strongly 
 associated with the oral retinoids than the topical retinoids. the animal reproductive toxicity data for 
 the oral retinoids demonstrate a typical pattern of retinoid embryopathy. the human data on 
 congenital malformations after oral retinoid exposure shows a significant risk of retinoid embryopathy 
 (of up to 30% of fetuses exposed); furthermore it is known that approximately one-third of pregnant 
 patients exposed to oral retinoids during pregnancy will have spontaneous abortions. pregnancy is an 
 absolute contraindication for all oral retinoids in the eu. 
 the prac noted that despite the introduction of pregnancy prevention measures, including ppps, cases 
 of pregnancy during treatment with oral retinoid continue to be reported in the eu. 
 compliance with the ppp is crucial to a positive benefit/risk balance for these products; therefore, the 
 adequacy of the pregnancy prevention measures, including ppps, for the oral retinoids acitretin, 
 alitretinoin and isotretinoin has been reviewed to ensure that the available materials effectively 
 encourage contraception use, regular pregnancy testing and shared responsibility between patients, 
 doctors and pharmacists in adhering to recommendations, and that this is communicated consistently 
 and effectively for all products. furthermore, specific studies to measure effectiveness of the agreed 
 changes to the ppp have been imposed on the marketing authorisation holders as an outcome of the 
 referral. 
 in this respect, the prac recommended amendments to the product information, including 
 harmonising the warnings and precautions of use for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin to reflect the teratogenic risk associated with their use and communication to healthcare 
 professionals through a direct healthcare professional communication. in addition, the prac 
 recommended changes to the educational materials for the oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin)) to ensure healthcare professionals and patients are informed about the risks associated</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 16/29</p><p>
 with oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin) in pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential and on the measures necessary to minimise the risk. these include a patient 
 reminder card, physician checklist/acknowledgement form and pharmacist checklist ensuring the 
 understanding and the awareness of prescribers and patients on the risks. the prac has also 
 recommended that educational materials be distributed via electronic channels such as qr codes, and 
 websites to make better use of the existing technology bearing in mind the young patient population 
 using these products. 
 the prac acknowledged that the implementation of the following elements of the ppp need to be 
 considered and agreed at national level to account for the different healthcare systems in the eu:</p><p>
 • the implementation of the 7-day prescription validity rule, in order not to impact on existing national legislation where the 7 days validity exists; 
 • patient signature of the physician checklist/acknowledgement form; • dissemination of the patient reminder card; • pharmacist checklist; • inclusion of appointment table in the patient reminder card; • the option of a pictogram/symbol to accompany the box warning wording and to be included in the visual reminder on the outer package to warn patients about the harm to unborn baby and 
 the need for effective contraception when using the medicinal product. 
 prac considered that given the oncological indications of oral tretinoin and oral bexarotene, further 
 risk minimisation measure (rmm) for these products regarding teratogenic effects, such as 
 strengthening the product information (pi) and additional risk minimisation measure (armm) would not 
 provide an added value given the specialist management, the population at risk and the nature of the 
 illness. 
 the prac noted the systemic exposure is negligible following topical application of retinoids and that 
 this does not appear to be affected to a clinically significant degree by the severity or extent of skin 
 disease. studies that examine the effects of human pregnancy on systemic absorption of topical 
 retinoids are also lacking. however, there was a consensus that several other factors may contribute to 
 an increased systemic exposure and therefore the risk cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 given that humans are the most sensitive species with respect to retinoid toxicity and considering the 
 limitations of the available data with respect to understanding of systemic absorption and also the 
 possible risks, the prac, considers that it is appropriate to take a very precautious approach. the 
 indications for the topical retinoids are non-life-threatening and there is no absolute clinical need for 
 the treatment during pregnancy and pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing. the prac 
 thereby concludes that the benefit-risk balance of topical retinoids in pregnancy is not favourable, and 
 therefore recommends that use of topical retinoids should be contraindicated during pregnancy and in 
 women planning a pregnancy. 
 the prac recognizes that the available data in relation to oral retinoids and the occurrence of 
 neuropsychiatric disorders have a number of important limitations that preclude the establishment of a 
 clear causal association. nevertheless, the prac considers that the data from patients presented in 
 case series, spontaneous case reports and individual patients&apos; experiences are considered to be very 
 important. although the underlying risk of psychiatric disorders within the patient populations can be 
 significant, it is advisable that patients taking oral retinoids are warned about the potential risk of 
 psychiatric reactions and the signs and symptoms to look out for. therefore, the prac agrees that all 
 oral retinoids should contain a warning about the potential risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in line</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 17/29</p><p>
 with some key principles. the data support that for isotretinoin and alitretinoin the information in section 4.4 and 4.8, of the smpc, should be in line with the agreed outcome of the 2003 art 30 
 referral for isotretinoin.</p><p>
 the prac further noted the extremely limited data relating to neuropsychiatric reactions after topical 
 administration of retinoids. given this and the negligible systemic exposure following topical no further 
 risk minimization activities are deemed necessary. 
 overall, the prac concludes that the benefit-risk balance of medicinal products containing retinoids 
 remains favourable, but that marketing authorisation(s) should be varied for both the oral and topical 
 retinoids to ensure risks associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders 
 are accurately and consistently addressed, as appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="4">4.

 pregnancy prevention programme</header><p>the prac recommended that the use of the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin, isotretinoin in wcbp should be subject to stringent restrictions to prevent exposure during pregnancy in view of the 
 teratogenicity due to retinoids. in order to achieve this, the prac agreed that an educational 
 pregnancy prevention programme (ppp) should be in place for oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin.</p><p>
 the ppp is aimed at: 
 • increasing awareness about the teratogenicity risk during treatment with oral retinoids containing acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin and providing guidance on how to manage that risk; 
 • ensuring that the patient is informed about contraception, and has a full understanding of the ‘risk period’, and what measures need to be observed through this risk period;</p><p>
 • informing the patient about pregnancy testing requirements, to ensure they understand why it is important, and why 30-day prescriptions ideally are required. 
 the ppp will include the following conditions: 
 individual patient and prescriber discussion should take place to guarantee patient engagement, 
 discuss therapeutic options and ensure the patient understanding of the risks and the measures 
 needed to minimise the risks. 
 the hazards and necessary precautions associated with retinoids use during pregnancy are presented 
 in the risk acknowledgement form and the patient reminder card which should be provided to the 
 patients.</p><p>
 the prescribers must ensure that the patient has understood and acknowledged the risks of congenital 
 malformations including the magnitude of these risks for children exposed to a retinoid in utero.</p><p>
 pregnancy testing should be performed prior to initiation of treatment, ideally monthly during 
 treatment and after stopping treatment for alitretinoin and isotretinoin pregnancy testing needs to be 
 performed one month after stopping treatment. for acitretin, women should undergo pregnancy test 
 periodically with 1-3 monthly intervals for a period of 3 years after stopping treatment. the patient 
 should be capable of complying with an effective contraceptive treatment/method, without interruption 
 during the entire duration of treatment with oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin, isotretinoin and for 1 
 month [3 years for acitretin] after the end of treatment 
 these patients must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention programme 
 measures and should be referred for contraceptive advice if they are not using effective contraception. 
 at least one effective method of contraception (preferably a user independent form such as an intra-
 uterine device or implant) or two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method 
 should be used. individual circumstances should be evaluated in each case, when choosing the 
 contraception method involving the patient in the discussion, to guarantee her engagement and</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 20/29</p><p>
 compliance with the chosen measures. in case of amenorrhea, the women should also be on effective contraception. 
 in case of pregnancy while using the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin, isotretinoin, the treatment 
 must be stopped and the patient be immediately referred to a physician specialized or experienced in 
 teratology for evaluation and advice.</p><p>

 grounds for recommendation</header><p>whereas, • the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (prac) considered the procedure under article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec for retinoid-containing medicinal products.</p><p>
 • the prac considered the totality of the data submitted, including responses from the marketing authorisation holders with regard to the consistency and effectiveness of existing routine and 
 additional risk minimisation measures for oral and topical retinoids-containing medicinal products 
 in relation to teratogenic effects and neuropsychiatric disorders. in addition, the prac considered 
 the views of patients and healthcare professionals in relation to their understanding and the 
 awareness of the teratogenic risk associated with the use of retinoid-containing medicines.</p><p>
 • with regards to the teratogenic risk, the prac confirmed that all oral retinoids (acitretin, alitretinoin, bexarotene, isotretinoin and tretinoin) are highly teratogenic and therefore must 
 continue to be contraindicated during pregnancy or in women of child bearing potential unless 
 they are using effective contraception. given the indications and patients populations that use 
 acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin it was considered that any use of these oral retinoids in 
 female patients at risk of pregnancy must be in accordance with the conditions of a pregnancy 
 prevention programme (ppp).</p><p>for tretinoin and bexarotene, it was considered that in light of the 
 oncological indications, specialist management in a hospital setting and population at risk that 
 existing risk minimisation was appropriate and proportionate.</p><p>
 • the prac also concluded that there was a need to further harmonise and streamline the measures in the ppp including associated educational materials for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin 
 and isotretinoin to ensure these are optimal to support discussions between patients and 
 healthcare professionals on the risks and the associated risk minimisation measures.</p><p>
 • the prac further considered that for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin a drug utilisation study with a complementary survey should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of 
 the proposed updated risk minimisation measures.</p><p>
 • a direct healthcare professional communication (dhpc) was also considered appropriate for all oral and topical retinoids.</p><p>
 • with regards to the teratogenic risk of topical retinoids (adapalene, alitretinoin, isotretinoin, tretinoin and tazarotene) the prac concluded that the data available show that after topical 
 application, systemic exposure is expected to be negligible and unlikely to result in adverse fetal 
 outcomes. however, given that humans are the most sensitive species to retinoid embryopathy 
 and that several other factors may contribute to an increased systemic exposure, such as 
 excessive use and damaged skin barrier, the prac agreed that the teratogenic risk cannot be 
 completely excluded. the prac therefore recommended that the use of topical retinoids should be 
 contraindicated during pregnancy and in women planning a pregnancy given the non-life 
 threatening nature of the indications.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 24/29</p><p>
 • with regards to neuropsychiatric disorders, the prac noted the limitations of the available data and considered that a clear causal relationship could not be established with the oral retinoids. 
 however, taking into account the target patient population, the prac recognised the possible 
 underlying risk of psychiatric disorders, and therefore recommended some changes to the product 
 information such as warnings and precautions and so that the current level of available evidence is 
 appropriately reflected.</p><p>
 • furthermore, the prac noted the extremely limited data relating to neuropsychiatric reactions after topical administration of retinoids. given this and the negligible systemic exposure following 
 topical use, the prac considered that no further risk minimization activities are deemed 
 necessary.</p><p>
 in view of the above, the prac considers that the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-containing medicinal 
 products remains favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information and risk 
 management plan, the conditions to the marketing authorisations and the related communication. 
 the prac, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
 for retinoid-containing medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>references</header><p>crijns, h. j., at al.

 referral procedure, notably with the proposed wording for smpc and pl for topical retinoids and also 
 with the proposed wording regarding neuropsychiatric disorders for oral retinoids.</p><p>
 the undersigned prac members however partially disagree with the recommendation of prac 
 regarding the pregnancy prevention programme (ppp) for the oral retinoids acitretin, alitretinoin and 
 isotretinoin:</p><p>
 the article 31 referral was, among others, triggered to evaluate the effectiveness of the ppp taking into 
 consideration that pregnancies did still occur under oral retinoids despite the implementation of the 
 ppp for isotretinoin in 2003 and later on for alitretinoin and acitretin. as a result of the referral a 
 harmonised wording for the product information for all three substances as well as key elements of a 
 tightened educational material were proposed, which is in principal endorsed.</p><p>
 however, regular pregnancy tests in women of childbearing potential and a limitation of prescription to 
 a 30 days’ supply as well as a 7 days validity of prescription for that patient group were elements of 
 the ppp since 2003. the prac now considers that the 7 days validity of prescription cannot be 
 scientifically justified. in addition, monthly pregnancy tests and a limitation of prescription to a 30 
 days’ supply are not considered to be mandatory by prac, but are recommended to be followed 
 “ideally” only.</p><p>
 the undersigned prac members consider that these elements have been crucial ones of the ppp since 
 2003. there is no reason to weaken or delete successfully implemented risk minimisation measures 
 now, taking into consideration that pregnancies do still occur under the more stringent regulations so 
 far.</p><p>
 the undersigned prac members are also aware of the significant inconsistency with effectively 
 implemented ppps for other substances with known teratogenicity in humans, i.e. the centrally 
 authorised products containing thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. it is the view of the 
 undersigned that such a difference is not scientifically justified and might question the validity of the 
 restrictions in place for these products, may give rise to public concerns in the light of less efforts in 
 pregnancy prevention for retinoids as planned while lacking sufficient justification, or might even 
 mislead to the assumption that retinoids may be considered much safer regarding there teratogenic 
 potential than in the past. 
 the main objective of the ppp is to protect the unborn child from potential harm caused by highly 
 teratogenic substances. considering the fact that isotretinoin, alitretinoin and acitretin are indicated to 
 treat non-life-threatening dermatological diseases (such as acne and hand eczema) and that therapy</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/254364/2018</p><p>
 page 27/29</p><p>
 can be stopped at any time without serious/potentially life-threatening consequences for the patient, the teratogenic risk of these substances might be crucial for the benefit-risk balance if not adequately 
 handled. in this context a pregnancy must certainly be excluded at regular (monthly!) intervals before 
 prescribing (again) an oral retinoid to treat a non-life-threatening dermatological disease. the 
 undersigned prac members therefore consider that monthly pregnancy tests and limited prescription 
 for a 30 days’ supply in women of childbearing potential as well as a 7 days validity of prescription are 
 stringent but crucial requirements for the use of oral retinoids in women of childbearing potential to 
 ensure close monitoring aiming at maximal protection of the unborn. 
 in conclusion, it is considered that the changes of the product information and the ppp recommended 
 by prac for medicinal products containing acitretin, alitretinoin or isotretinoin for oral use is currently 
 not sufficiently risk proportionate and may negatively impact the safe use of these highly teratogenic 
 substances in women of childbearing potential</p></section><section><header>prac members expressing this divergent opinion:</header><p>• martin huber (de) • brigitte keller-stanislawski (independent scientific expert nominated by the european commission)</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 in conclusion the mandatory specific prescription form, the 7 day prescription validity, and prescription 
 restrictions for 4 weeks treatment (to facilitate that regular pregnancy testing and monitoring is 
 performed to ensure that the patient is not pregnant before receiving the next cycle of medication) is 
 successfully implemented in the national regulation of latvia for products with ppp that contain active 
 substances with high risk of teratogenicity (oral retinoids, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide). 
 that is in accordance with conditions set by ec to ensure consistent and clear approach regarding the</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 tools alerting hcp on serious risk and ensuring that defined responsibilities in the controlled distribution programme are fulfilled. 
 the undersigned prac member considers that the provided scientific and regulatory grounds for the 
 deleting of 7 day prescription validity for oral retinoids from the product information</p><p>
 and introducing 
 the term “ideally” in the statement that “prescription should ideally be limited to 30 days” within this 
 referral procedure are not sufficiently robust. thus the mentioned changes are not supported taking 
 into account that they may lead to the weakening of ppp.</p></section><section><header>prac member expressing this divergent opinion:</header><p>• zane neikena</p><p>
