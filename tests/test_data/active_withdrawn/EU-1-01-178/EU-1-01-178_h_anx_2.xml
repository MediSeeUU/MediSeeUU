 dose modification guidelines: the 300 mg/m2/day dose level may be adjusted to 200 mg/m2/day thento 100 mg/m
 2/day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity.</p><p>when toxicity is controlled,doses may be carefully readjusted upward.</p><p>with appropriate clinical monitoring, individual patients
 may benefit from doses above 300 mg/m
 2/day.</p><p>doses greater than 650 mg/m2/day have not beenevaluated in patients with ctcl. in clinical trials, bexarotene was administered for up to 118 weeks to
 patients with ctcl. treatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.
 use in children and adolescents: the clinical safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in the paediatricpopulation (below 18 years of age) have not been studied and this product should not be used in a
 paediatric population until further data become available.
 3use in the elderly: of the total number of patients with ctcl in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years orolder, while 30% were 70 years or older.</p><p>no overall differences in safety were observed between
 patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to
 bexarotene cannot be ruled out.</p><p>the standard dose should be used in the elderly.
 renal insufficiency: no formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency.clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a
 minor excretory pathway for bexarotene. in all evaluated patients, the estimated renal clearance of
 bexarotene was less than 1 ml/minute. in view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency
 should be monitored carefully while on bexarotene therapy.</p></section><section><header>4.3contraindications</header><p>known hypersensitivity to bexarotene or to any of the excipients of the productpregnancy and lactation

 should not donate blood for transfusion.
 lipids: hyperlipidaemia has been identified as an effect associated with the use of bexarotene inclinical studies.</p><p>fasting blood lipid determinations (triglycerides and cholesterol) should be
 performed before bexarotene therapy is initiated and at weekly intervals</p><p>until the lipid response to
 bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and then at intervals no less
 than monthly thereafter.</p><p>fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalised with appropriate
 intervention prior to bexarotene therapy.</p><p>every attempt should be made to maintain triglyceride levels
 below 4.52 mmol/l in order to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae. if fasting triglycerides are elevated
 or become elevated during treatment, institution of antilipaemic therapy is recommended, and if
 necessary,</p><p>dose reductions (from 300 mg/m
 2/day of bexarotene to 200 mg/m2/day, and if necessary to100 mg/m
 2/day) or treatment discontinuation.</p><p>data from clinical studies indicate that bexaroteneconcentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin. however, concomitant
 administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene
 and therefore, concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended (see
 4.5). elevations of serum cholesterol should be managed according to current medical practice.
 pancreatitis: acute pancreatitis associated with elevations of fasting serum triglycerides has beenreported in clinical studies. patients with ctcl having risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior episodes
 of pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes
 mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated
 with pancreatic toxicity) should not be treated with bexarotene, unless the potential benefit outweighs
 the risk.
 liver function test (lft) abnormalities: lft elevations associated with the use of bexarotene havebeen reported.</p><p>based on data from ongoing clinical trials, elevation of lfts resolved within one
 month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. baseline lfts
 should be obtained, and lfts should be carefully monitored weekly during the first month and then
 monthly thereafter.</p><p>consideration should be given to a suspension or discontinuation of bexarotene if
 test results reach greater than three times the upper limit of normal values for sgot/ast,
 sgpt/alt, or bilirubin.
 4thyroid function test alterations: changes in thyroid function tests have been observed in patientsreceiving bexarotene, most often noted as a reversible reduction in thyroid hormone (total thyroxine
 [total t
 4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels.</p><p>baseline thyroid function tests should beobtained and then monitored at least monthly during treatment and as indicated by the emergence of
 symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism.</p><p>patients with symptomatic hypothyroidism on bexarotene
 therapy have been treated with thyroid hormone supplements with resolution of symptoms.
 leucopenia: leucopenia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. themajority of cases resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>determination of
 white blood cell count with differential count should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first
 month and then monthly thereafter.
 anaemia: anaemia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies.determination of haemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then
 monthly thereafter. decreases of haemoglobin should be managed according to current medical
 practice.
 lens opacities: following bexarotene 
 treatment, some patients were observed to have previously
 undetected lens opacities or a change in pre-existing lens opacities unrelated to treatment duration or
 dose level of exposure. given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in the older
 patient population represented in the clinical studies, there was no apparent association between the
 incidence of lens opacity formation and bexarotene administration. however, an adverse effect of
 long-term bexarotene treatment on lens opacity formation in humans has not been excluded. any
 patient treated with bexarotene who experiences visual difficulties should have an appropriate
 ophthalmologic examination.
 vitamin a supplementation: because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin a, patients should beadvised to limit vitamin a supplements to 
 �15,000 iu/day to avoid potential additive toxic effects.patients with diabetes mellitus: caution should be exercised when administering bexarotene in patientsusing insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g.
 thiazolidinediones).</p><p>based on the known mechanism of action,</p><p>bexarotene may potentially</p><p>enhance
 the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycaemia.</p><p>no cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the
 use of bexarotene as monotherapy have been reported.
 photosensitivity: the use of some retinoids has been associated with photosensitivity.</p><p>patients shouldbe advised to minimise exposure to sunlight and avoid sun lamps during therapy with bexarotene, as 
 invitro</p><p>data indicate that bexarotene may potentially have a photosensitising effect.oral contraceptives: bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoreticallyreduce the efficacy of oestroprogestive contraceptives.</p><p>thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended
 in a woman of child-bearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal form of contraception is also required,
 because bexarotene belongs to a therapeutic class for which the human malformative risk is high.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>drug interactions: effects of other substances on bexarotene: no formal studies to evaluate druginteractions with bexarotene have been conducted. on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of
 bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4 (cyp3a4), coadministration with other cyp3a4 substrates such
 as ketoconazole, itraconazole, protease inhibitors, clarithromycin and erythromycin may theoretically
 lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. furthermore, co-administration with cyp3a4
 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone or phenobarbital may theoretically cause a
 reduction in plasma bexarotene concentrations.
 a population analysis of plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with ctcl indicated that
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of
 5bexarotene. the mechanism of this interaction is unknown. under similar conditions, bexaroteneconcentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin or levothyroxine.
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended.
 drug interactions: effects of bexarotene on other substances: there are indications that bexarotenemay induce cyp3a4.</p><p>therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-
 induction of its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels greater than 300 mg/m
 2/day, mayincrease the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by
 cytochrome p450 3a4, such as tamoxifen.</p><p>for example bexarotene may reduce the efficacy of oral
 contraceptives (see 4.4 and 4.6).
 laboratory test interactions: ca125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuatedwith bexarotene therapy.
 food interactions: in all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take targretin capsules with orimmediately following a meal.</p><p>in one clinical study, plasma bexarotene auc and c
 max values weresubstantially higher following the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the
 administration of a glucose solution.</p><p>because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based
 upon administration with food, it is recommended that targretin capsules be administered with food.
 on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4, grapefruit juice may
 theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 
 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of bexarotene in pregnant women. studies inanimals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p><p>based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures
 to bexarotene, a margin of safety for human teratogenicity has not been demonstrated (see 5.3).
 bexarotene is contraindicated in pregnancy (see 4.3).
 if this drug is used inadvertently during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking
 this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.
 women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth-control measures when bexarotene is used.
 a negative, sensitive, pregnancy test (e.g. serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, beta-hcg)
 should be obtained within one week prior to bexarotene therapy.</p><p>effective contraception must be used
 from the time of the negative pregnancy test through the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at
 least one month following discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>whenever contraception is required, it is
 recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously.</p><p>bexarotene can
 potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of
 oestroprogestative contraceptives (see 4.5).</p><p> thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a woman
 with child-bearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal contraceptive method is also recommended.
 male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or may potentially become
 pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one
 month after the last dose.
 lactation: it is not known whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk.</p><p>bexarotene should not beused in nursing mothers.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. however,dizziness and visual difficulties have been reported in patients taking targretin. patients who
 experience dizziness or visual difficulties during therapy must not drive or operate machinery.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>6the safety of bexarotene has been examined in clinical studies of 193 patients with ctcl whoreceived bexarotene for up to 118 weeks and in 420 non-ctcl cancer patients in other studies.

 the majority of adverse reactions were noted at a higher incidence at doses greater than
 300 mg/m
 2/day. generally, these resolved without sequelae on dose reduction or drug withdrawal.however, among a total of 810 patients including those without malignancy treated with bexarotene,
 there were three serious adverse reactions with fatal outcome (acute pancreatitis, subdural haematoma
 and liver failure). of these, liver failure, subsequently determined to be not related to bexarotene, was
 the only one to occur in a ctcl patient.
 hypothyroidism generally occurs 4-8 weeks after commencement of therapy. it may be asymptomatic
 and responds to treatment with thyroxine and resolves upon drug withdrawal.
 bexarotene has a different adverse reaction profile to other oral, non-retinoid x receptor (rxr) -
 selective retinoid drugs. owing to its primarily rxr-binding activity, bexarotene is less likely to
 cause mucocutaneous, nail, and hair toxicities; arthralgia; and myalgia; which are frequently reported
 with retinoic acid receptor (rar) -binding agents.</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>no clinical experience with an overdose of targretin capsules has been reported.</p><p>any overdoseshould be treated with supportive care for the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.
 doses up to 1000 mg/m
 2/day of bexarotene have been administered in clinical studies with no acutetoxic effects.</p><p>single doses of 1500 mg/kg (9000 mg/m

 pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header>5.1pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agentsatc code: l01xx25
 bexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and
 activation of the three rxrs: 
 �, �, and �.</p><p>once activated, these receptors function as transcriptionfactors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin
 sensitisation.</p><p>the ability of the rxrs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are
 important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene
 are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the rars. 
 in vitro, bexarotene inhibits thegrowth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic and squamous cell origin. 
 in vivo, bexarotene causestumour regression in some animal models and prevents tumour induction in others.</p><p>however, the
 exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) is
 unknown.
 bexarotene capsules were evaluated in clinical trials of 193 patients with ctcl of whom 93 had
 advanced stage disease refractory to prior systemic therapy. among the 61 patients treated at an initial
 dose of 300 mg/m
 2/day, the overall response rate, according to a global assessment by the physician,was 51% (31/61) with a clinical complete response rate of 3%. responses were also determined by a
 composite score of five clinical signs (surface area, erythema, plaque elevation, scaling and
 9hypo/hyperpigmentation) which also considered all extracutaneous ctcl manifestations. the overallresponse rate according to this composite assessment was 31% (19/61) with a clinical complete
 response rate of 7% (4/61)
 .</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption/dose proportionality: pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m2. terminalelimination half-life values were generally between one and three hours. following repeat once daily
 dose administration at dose levels 
 � 230 mg/m2, cmax and auc in some patients were less thanrespective single dose values. no evidence of prolonged accumulation was observed. at the
 recommended initial daily-dose level (300 mg/m
 2), single-dose and repeated daily-dose bexarotenepharmacokinetic parameters were similar.
 protein binding/distribution: bexarotene is highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. the uptake ofbexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated.
 metabolism: bexarotene metabolites in plasma include 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene.</p><p>
 in vitro studies suggest glucuronidation as a metabolic pathway, and that cytochromep450 3a4 is the major cytochrome p450 isozyme responsible for formation of the oxidative
 metabolites.</p><p>based on the 
 in vitro binding and the retinoid receptor activation profile of themetabolites, and on the relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have
 little impact on the pharmacological profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.
 excretion: neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. theestimated renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute.</p><p>renal excretion is not a significant
 elimination pathway for bexarotene.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: bexarotene is not genotoxic. carcinogenicitystudies have not been conducted. fertility studies have not been conducted; however, in sexually
 immature male dogs, reversible aspermatogenesis (28-day study) and testicular degeneration (91-day
 study) were seen. when bexarotene was administered for six months to sexually mature dogs, no
 testicular effects were seen. effects on fertility cannot be excluded. bexarotene, in common with the
 majority of retinoids, was teratogenic and embryotoxic in an animal test species at systemic exposures
 that are achievable clinically in humans. irreversible cataracts involving the posterior area of the lens
 occurred in rats and dogs treated with bexarotene at systemic exposures that are achievable clinically
 in humans. the aetiology of this finding is unknown. an adverse effect of long-term bexarotene
 treatment on cataract formation in humans has not been excluded.</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars
