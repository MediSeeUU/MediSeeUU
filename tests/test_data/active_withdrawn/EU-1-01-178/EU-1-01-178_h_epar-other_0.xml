 pursuant to article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec, the 
 united kingdom triggered on 7 july 2016 a referral 
 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and 
 requested the prac to review the routine risk 
 minimisation in place for the oral and topical 
 retinoids to ensure the available data and the risks 
 associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and 
 neuropsychiatric disorders are accurately and 
 consistently addressed within the product

      page 5/13 information where appropriate and justified by data. furthermore, the prac was requested to review any 
 additional risk minimisation measures to ensure that 
 these are optimal in terms of provision of information 
 and delivery of effective risk management that is 
 subject to appropriate monitoring. the prac was 
 called upon to assess the impact of the above 
 concerns on the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-
 containing medicinal products and issue a 
 recommendation on whether the products should be 
 maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.
   as the request resulted from the evaluation of data 
 resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the prac 
 issued a recommendation to the committee for 
 medicinal products for human use (chmp).

  pharmacokinetics in special populations 
  age: based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
 data for 232 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 343 patients 
 aged &lt; 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect 
 on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. 
  body weight and gender: based on the population 
 pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a 
 weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent 
 clearance increases with increasing body weight.  gender 
 has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene 
 pharmacokinetics. 
  race: based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
 data for 540 caucasian and 44 black patients, bexarotene 
 pharmacokinetics are similar in blacks and caucasians.  
 there are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences 
 in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races.

 line with approved templates and changes to the contact 
 details of local representatives were made.
