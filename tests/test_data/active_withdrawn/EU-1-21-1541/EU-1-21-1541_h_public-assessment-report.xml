 figure: active substance structure the chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of nmr spectrum, mass spectrum, infrared spectrum, uv spectrum and elemental analysis. 
 the active substance is a slightly hygroscopic</p><p>white to off-white fine crystalline powder which exhibits 
 ph dependent aqueous solubility
 . according to fda bcs guideline, dasatinib is considered a low solubility active substance. 
 optical isomerism is not possible because there is no chiral carbon in the active substance molecule. 
 dasatinib is known to exist in few anhydrous and numerous solvated crystalline forms and in an 
 amorphous form, based on literature survey and extensive polymorphism screening studies.</p><p>desired 
 anhydrous dasatinib form is consistently obtained by the proposed manufacturing process of the active 
 substance. all the other known anhydrous forms and solvates are not likely to be formed in the last 
 crystallisation step and in the solvent system used or by storage of the active substance, hence, they 
 cannot be present as impurities in the produced desired polymorphic form.</p></section><section><header>manufacture, characterisation and process controls</header><p>an active substance master file (asmf) procedure was used to provide information on the active substance. detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the 
 restricted part of the asmf and it was considered satisfactory. 
 dasatinib is synthesised in 2 main stages using commercially available well-defined starting materials 
 with acceptable specifications.</p><p>
 adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. the specifications and control methods 
 for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.</p><p> the characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the eu guideline 
 on chemistry of new active substances. 
 potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
 the active substance is packaged in double pe bags with antistatic additive as primary packing, placed 
 in multilayer pet/al/pet/ldpe bag and introduced into cardboard drum. which complies with the ec 
 directive 2002/72/ec and ec 10/2011 as amended.</p></section><section><header>specification</header><p>the active substance specification includes tests for description (visual),</p><p>identification (ir, hplc, xrd), assay</p><p>(hplc), water (ph. eur.), sulphated ash (ph. eur.), related substances (gc, hplc), 
 residual solvents (gc, hplc), and particle size (laser diffraction). 
 the specification for dasatinib has been established based on the guidelines of ich q3a, ich 
 q3c, ich q3d and ich q6a. dasatinib is not listed in any of the official pharmacopoeias. 
 the limits on related substances are based on analyses of so far manufactured batches of the active 
 substance and the ich guideline q3a and are considered satisfactory. 
 according to the ich guideline q3c for residual solvents, are class 2 and class 3 solvents in 
 compliance with the ich guideline q3c. limits for these solvents are in line with the guideline and also 
 tightened according to actual results. 
 the analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
 appropriately validated in accordance with the ich guidelines. satisfactory information regarding the 
 reference standards used has been presented.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 140 mg: white to off-white, round, 11 mm of diameter, coated tablets debossed on one side with 
 &quot;das&quot; and &quot;140&quot; on the other side.</p><p>
 the aim of the finished product development was to develop a generic dosage form of the reference 
 medicinal product sprycel tablet 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg and 140 mg.</p><p>
 initially, the quality target product profile (qtpp) was defined based on the properties of the active 
 substance, characterisation of the reference medicinal product, and consideration of the reference 
 product label. identification of critical quality attributes (cqas) was based on the impact to patient 
 safety and efficacy resulting from failure to meet that quality attributes of the finished product. 
 pharmaceutical development focused on those cqas that could be impacted by a realistic change to</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/117327/2022</p><p>
 page 12/30</p><p>
 the finished product formulation or manufacturing process. for the generic medicinal product, these cqas included assay, uniformity of dosage units, residual solvent content, dissolution, and 
 degradation. a quality by design (qbd) approach was used to define the formulation and 
 manufacturing process and to provide acceptable quality attributes of the generic.</p><p>however, no design 
 spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.</p><p>
 reported literature indicates that dasatinib is a poorly soluble, highly permeable biopharmaceutics 
 classification system (bcs) class ii compound. the reference medicinal product contains dasatinib 
 monohydrate, whereas dasatinib anhydrous has been used for the development of the generic medicinal 
 product. the data demonstrated that both forms of dasatinib (anhydrous and monohydrate) have highest 
 solubility at ph conditions of 4.0 and below. however, in media at ph 3.0-4.0, the anhydrous form was 
 shown to be several times more soluble than the monohydrate form. 
 these solubility differences lead to different 
 in vitro release profiles from that of the reference medicinal product. the formulation has been developed to meet the bio-equivalence criteria. dasatinib desired 
 polymorphic form samples were exposed to different stress conditions and x-ray powder diffraction was 
 performed. preliminary stress testing was carried out on dasatinib anhydrous to study its chemical 
 stability, impurity profile and degradation pathway and to facilitate the development of a stability-
 indicating method.</p><p>stressed samples were compared to the unstressed sample. the data showed that 
 dasatinib anhydrous is labile to uv exposure and oxidative stress treatments, but stable under acidic, 
 alkaline, and thermal (both in absence and in presence of high humidity) stresses. xrd data of studies 
 on polymorphic stability under stressed conditions showed that dasatinib desired polymorphic form is 
 stable under thermal, humidity, pressure and grinding stress conditions. the dasatinib desired 
 polymorphic form is also retained after preparing the slurry with water but is converted to ipa (isopropyl 
 alcohol) solvate after preparing the slurry with ipa.</p><p>the excipients used in the proposed generic product were selected based on those used in the reference 
 medicinal product, the formulation development strategy and excipient compatibility studies. most 
 excipients and the quantities used are common in the manufacture of this type of dosage form and are 
 considered safe in the proposed concentrations. binary mixtures of excipients and active substance at 
 different ratios were stored under accelerated conditions in hdpe bottles for three months and analysed. 
 all results were within specifications; it was therefore concluded that the proposed excipients are 
 compatible with the active sustance. all excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
 quality is compliant with ph. eur standards exept the coating solution which complies with in house 
 specifications. there are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. the list of 
 excipients is included in section 6.1 of the smpc and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.</p><p>
 during stages of development, a formulation using similar excipients and manufacturing process as those 
 of the reference product was evaluated. developed formulation showed that the drug release was 
 comparable as that of the reference product. the 
 in-vitro dissolution method developed and validated is the qc method that is able to discriminate between good batches and reject the bad ones. the 
 in-vivo comparative bioavailability study conducted between the reference medicinal product sprycel 140 mg and the proposed generic medicinal product has been shown to be comparable (c
 max and auc data). the t
 max of the generic medicinal product is also relatively short at 0.75h.</p><p>a major objection (mo) was raised because of a discrepancy in dissolution profiles observed at ph 3 with 
 two different batches. the applicant has clarified that the discrepancy in the dissolution profiles at ph 3 
 resulted from a batch which had a different composition, particularly with respect to binders (with higher 
 amounts of eudragit), to batches which have the composition proposed for marketing. the mo was 
 considered resolved.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the commercial manufacturing process of the finished product consists in premixing, granulation, drying, milling, blending, lubrication, compression, and coating. several batches from different blends of the 
 submission and validation batches were analysed and the percentage of each polymorphic form of active 
 substance in the finished product was determined based on the xrd patterns of the pure active 
 substance. the results of these batches were compared with that of the bio batch. polymorphic form 
 proportions (tested by xrd) were included in both release and shelf life specifications.</p><p>
 as major objection (mo) on dissolution limit and discriminatory power was raised , the applicant</p><p>
 proposed dissolution specifications (nlt 75% in 45 mins), it could be observed that the dissolution of</p><p>
 the batch made with active substance with particles larger than the limits for psd, would fail the 
 dissolution test. the batch made with finer active substance, despite the increased surface area does 
 not result in significantly faster dissolution. in both cases (made with finer and larger particles), the 
 dissolution profiles fail similarity comparison with the bio batch. thus, with limits in place for the active 
 substance psd and dissolution, the finished product performance can be ensured. the mo was considered 
 to be resolved. 
 comparative bioavailability studies under fasting conditions was performed to assess the bioequivalence 
 of formulation of pivotal batch after a single oral dose administration. in the pivotal bioequivalence study, 
 the comparison was made between the proposed generic medicinal product and the eu reference 
 medicinal product. the results presented showed that the criteria used to assess bioequivalence between 
 the generic and reference formulations were fulfilled. the test to reference ratio of geometric ls means 
 and corresponding 90% confidence interval for cmax, auc0-t and auc0-∞ were all within the 
 acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. 
 a biowaiver for 20, 50, 70, 80, and 100 mg strengths was applied by the applicant. in support to this 
 request, the applicant stated that all strengths are dose proportional; however this was not considered 
 to be sufficient justification on its own. in order to demonstrate similarity between the bio batch and all 
 the remaining strengths, comparison of dissolution profiles of the highest strength of the bio batch</p><p>to 
 the dissolution profiles of all the remaining strengths (without surfactant) at phs 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 was 
 provided and considered satisfactory.</p><p>
 no data was provided on the proportions of polymorphic forms in the batches used for the request of 
 biowaiver, therefore, it could not be confirmed that all batches of all strengths to be manufactured 
 routinely will have the same proportions of polymorphic forms as the biobatch. this precluded the 
 granting of the biowaiver. therefore, the chmp concluded that the biowaiver may only be granted if a 
 limit for both anhydrous and solvate polymorphic form proportions is included in the release and shelf 
 life specification of all strengths. the applicant agreed to include a limit for both anhydrous and solvate 
 polymorphic form proportions in the release and shelf life specification of all strengths and the issue was 
 considered solved.</p><p>
 a risk assessment of the overall finished product manufacturing process was performed to identify the 
 high-risk steps that may affect the cqas of the finished product. subsequently, the cqas of 
 intermediates from each process step that impact the finished product cqas were identified.</p><p>
 for each process step, a risk assessment was conducted to identify potentially high-risk process</p><p>
 variables which could impact the identified intermediate cqas and, ultimately, the finished product</p><p>
 cqas. these variables were then investigated to better understand the manufacturing process</p><p>and to 
 develop a control strategy to reduce the risk of a failed batch. 
 several trials were made with active substance having different particle size distribution (psd) values to 
 evaluate the effects of particle size on assay and content uniformity of the finished product. based on 
 the results, there was no significant difference observed among the batch manufactured with different</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/117327/2022</p><p>
 page 14/30</p><p>
 psds of active substance. all results met the specifications. the psd specification was determined based on the range evaluated during process validation. 
 effects of the binders, disintegrant, lubricant, and coating level were studied. as a result of these studies, 
 the commercial formulation of the finished product was selected. 
 the primary packaging is alu/alu blisters (blisters or perforated unit dose blisters). the material complies 
 with ph. eur. and ec requirements. the choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
 stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product and process controls</header><p>the manufacturing process consists of 10 main steps: weighing, sieving, mixing, wet granulation, drying, blending, lubrication, compression, film
 ‐coating and packaging. the process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
 major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies in tablets blend 
 and tablets 20, 50, 70, 80, 100 and 140 mg. the validation was performed on six commercial scale 
 batches of dasatinib tablets blend. the two extremes of tablet strength (20 &amp; 140 mg) were validated 
 with 3 commercial scale batches each. the 100 mg strength was also validated with 3 batches. the 
 validation was performed on one batch for the intermediate strengths: 50, 70 and 80 mg. it has been 
 demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
 quality in a reproducible manner, however the chmp recommended to carry out the leak test for 
 packaging integrity and visual checks during commercial phase full scale packaging validation and submit 
 the data via a variation. the in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.</p></section><section><header>product specification</header><p>the finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form description (visual), identification (hplc, uv), assay (hplc), uniformity of dosage unit (hplc), dissolution (uplc), 
 degradation products (hplc), residual solvents (
 gc-hs), water (ph. eur.), disintegration (ph. eur.), polymorphic forms (xrd), and microbial limit tests (ph. eur). the specifications are the same for all strengths, 
 except the description which include 
 “20”, “50”, “70”, “80”, “100”, and “140” mg depending on the strength. 
 in the context of reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic solid oral immediate 
 release products with systemic action (decision tree for the principles for setting specifications based 
 on the dissolution results of the bio batch), immediate release is identified as at least 75% (q) of the 
 active substance is dissolved within 45 minutes. the q derives from the ph. eur. (5.17.1) 
 recommendation for conventional release dosage forms. therefore, in line with the reflection paper, 
 the applicant was asked as major objection to set a single dissolution specification of nlt 75% in 45 
 minutes or else set a specification for more than one time point. the finished product specifications 
 limit was amended as requested. 
 the potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
 based approach in line with the ich q3d guideline for elemental impurities.</p><p>batch analysis data on 3 
 batches using a validated icp-oes method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental 
 impurity does not exceed their pde, nor their control thresholds. based on the risk assessment, it can 
 be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
 a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
 requested as major objection considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
 “questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the chmp opinion for the</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/117327/2022</p><p>
 page 15/30</p><p>
 article 5(3) of regulation (ec) no 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (ema/409815/2020) and the “assessment report- procedure under article 5(3) of regulation 
 ec (no) 726/2004- nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (ema/369136/2020). based 
 on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
 nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product.</p><p>
 therefore, no additional 
 control measures are deemed necessary. 
 the analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
 accordance with the ich guidelines. satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
 has been presented. 
 batch analysis results are provided for 12 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
 manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.</p><p>
 the finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
 traditional final product release testing.</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>stability data from 12 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°c / 60% rh) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°c / 75% 
 rh) according to the ich guidelines were provided. the batches of medicinal product are identical to 
 those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.</p><p>
 samples were tested for description, assay, dissolution, degradation products, water, disintegration, 
 polymorphic forms and microbial limit. the analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
 a reduced design has been considered in line with the ich q1d guideline. as defined on ich guidelines, 
 topic q1d: “bracketing is the design of a stability schedule such that only samples on the extremes of 
 certain design factors (e.g., strength, container size and/or fill) are tested at all time points as in a full 
 design”. a reduced design of stability study, more precisely, bracketing was chosen, seen that the 
 formulation of all the strengths is identical and materials of the container closure system are the same 
 for all the strengths. the selected approach, regarding the exhibit batches, is to follow in stability three 
 batches of each extreme strength and one batch of each intermediate strength.</p><p>
 the long
 ‐term stability studies conducted on the finished product demonstrate that the all parameters meet the specifications with the exception of dissolution, for a period of 24 months for all batches under 
 stability. results also conform after 6 months under accelerated stability conditions in the proposed 
 container closure system for all batches that are part of the stability program.</p><p>
 before a shelf life (and associated storage conditions) and a hold time was granted, the applicant was 
 asked, as major objection, to address all the observations related to the intra- and inter-batch variability 
 in dissolution results of stability batches and provide more long-term stability data. the applicant did not 
 provide data of the original stability batches at 36 months but restarted stability studies afresh. the 
 applicant was reminded that new time points should be tested at a specification of nlt 75% (q) at 45 
 minutes and stability studies should include tests for proportions of the polymorphic forms in the finished 
 product. in line with the chmp comments, the dissolution limit in the shelf life specifications was 
 tightened by the applicant to nlt 75% (q) in 45 minutes and additional data was generated on new 
 batches. twelve validation batches were, stored in bulk, packaged in blisters and then followed in long-
 term and accelerated conditions. all dissolution results performed on the validation batches meet the 
 revised dissolution limit nlt 75% (q) at 45 minutes for a period of 6 months. all these batches were 
 stored in bulk for 9 months before being packaged in blisters. all the stability results from the new 
 batches met the new established dissolution limits nlt 75% (q) at 45 minutes.</p><p>given that, for the 
 stability studies of the validation batches, the applicant only provided dissolution values, the results of 
 the previously submitted batches are being taken into consideration to inform on the other stability</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/117327/2022</p><p>
 page 16/30</p><p>
 parameters and grant the shelf life. no concerns remained outstanding following the assessment of the other stability parameters during previous rounds of this procedure. since there is currently 6 months’ 
 real time stability data available, the shelf life granted in line with ich q1e is 12 months. polymorphic 
 form proportions have not been evaluated in stability studies so far but, due to the inclusion of limits for 
 such proportions in both the release and shelf-life specifications these are to be included in stability 
 studies from this point onwards.</p><p>
 forced degradation study was carried out on the finished product in solution and power, the effects of 
 acid, alkaline, ultraviolet irradiation, thermal and oxidation stresses on the finished product were studied 
 and the resulting degradation products were monitored. the forced degradation study of the finished 
 product in solution has shown that finished product is sensitive to all stress treatments, forced 
 degradation evaluation on powder samples has shown relatively good stability showing a slight 
 degradation of the finished product.</p><p>
 in addition, five batches were exposed to light as defined in the ich guideline on photostability testing 
 of new drug substances and products. it has been concluded that the finished product is not sensitive 
 to light.</p><p>
 a bulk stability study was performed to propose a bulk holding time period for the bulk tablets. the bulk 
 tablets are packed in the designated packaging material for bulk storage. the batches are stored under 
 ich controlled conditions 25°c ± 2°c, 60 % rh ± 5% for 9 months. the testing is performed initially, 
 at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months. the results between the bulk tablets and the packaged batches 
 of identical stations do not show significant differences. another bulk stability study was conducted where 
 the dissolution specification was nlt 75% (q) in 45 minutes; tablets were tested initially and after 9 
 months and the dissolution specification was met. it is therefore possible to conclude that the product 
 can be kept in bulk tablets for a period of 9 months before being packaged in the proposed container 
 closure system.</p><p>
 based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months without any special storage 
 conditions as stated in the smpc (section 6.3) are acceptable.</p></section><section><header>adventitious agents</header><p>it is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the

 a number of issues were raised by chmp as major objections (mo). the mos were related to 
 formulation, dissolution of the finished product, presence of polymorphic forms of the active substance 
 in the finished product, the strength biowaivers, primary packaging material, dissolution specifications 
 of the finished product, risk evaluation of nitrosamines and stability of the finished product. the issues

 terms of safety. the applicant responded that the proposed release specification for isopropanol 
 ensures that the total daily exposure to isopropanol from dasatinib accordpharma tablets will be below 
 the established pde of 50 mg/day (impurities: guideline for residual solvents q3c (r6). ich. 20

 discussion on clinical aspects</header><p>during the assessment a number of issues were raised. the applicant was asked to justify a number of outliers observed and discuss the issue in the context of the known issues of variability in dasatinib 
 exposure relating to the brand leader. the applicant has addressed the subjects mentioned in the major 
 objection at d120 and all outliers have since been justified. on another aspect the applicant was asked 
 to update the dossier submitting a request for biowaiver of the additional requested strengths. the 
 biowaiver request was submitted and it is extensively discussed in the quality part of this report. 
 the results discussed above show that the pk parameters of the bioequivalence study pass the 
 requirements of the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence where the applicant states that the 
 90% confidence intervals calculated for the primary parameters c
 max and auc0-t for dasatinib fall within the 80.00 – 125.00% acceptance range after single dose administration under fasting conditions. the 
 submission of a single be study in the fasted state was in line with the requirements of the product 
 specific be guidance for dasatinib at the time the application was submitted. 
 it is noted that the product specific be guidance for dasatinib has since been revised. it specifically 
 mentions the issue of outliers (these were the cause of concern in the major objection raised at day 
 120). in fact the guideline states that “some subjects may randomly exhibit low concentrations of 
 dasatinib when taking dasatinib products in the fasted state. therefore, these products are considered 
 with specific formulation characteristics and, consequently, bioequivalence should be evaluated under 
 fasting and fed conditions” 
 hence a major objection was raised by the chmp and the applicant was asked to discuss the issue of 
 variabilitiy in dasatinib exposure in that some subjects which may randomly exhibit low concentrations 
 of dasatanib when taking dasatinib products in the fasted state. as these products are considered with 
 specific formulation characteristics and bioequivalence should be evaluated under fasting and fed 
 conditions the applicant was asked to address the lack of a fed study and to assess</p><p>the impact of food 
 on the variability of this product. the applicant was requested to justify providing a fasting study only</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/117327/2022</p><p>
 page 26/30</p><p>
 taking account of the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence where “subjects with very low plasma concentrations may be excluded if auc is less than 5% of reference medicinal product geometric 
 mean auc.”</p><p>
 the applicant submitted a fed study on the 100 mg strength compared to the us innovator product for 
 dasatinib using parameters approved by fda for variable drugs. the results of dasatinib fed study have 
 been re-analyzed against ema bioequivalence criteria and statistical method. the test product dasatinib 
 100 mg film-coated tablets demonstrated a comparable extent of absorption of dasatinib to the 
 reference product sprycel (dasatinib) 100 mg film-coated tablets with a test/reference (t/r) 
 geometric mean ratios (gmr) of approximately 97% for auct, with the corresponding 90% ci contained 
 within the ema-acceptance range 80.00% - 125.00%. the test product also demonstrated a comparable 
 rate of absorption of dasatinib to the reference product with a t/r gmr of approximately 86% for cmax 
 within the ema-acceptance range 80.00% - 125.00% and corresponding 90% ci contained within the 
 ema-widening acceptance range 78.25 
 –</p><p>127.80%. in parallel, the applicant performed a physicochemical comparison of the eu reference and us reference product sprycel comparing also their 
 dissolution profiles illustrating their similarity.</p><p>
 the fed study falls within the acceptance range for 90%ci for the auc but not for the cmax. the 
 geometric mean ratios are 97% for auct and 85% for cmax. for cmax the 90% ci are contained within 
 the ema-widened acceptance range 78.25 
 – 127.80% for variable drugs. the applicant seems to be using the fda reference scaled and unscaled bioequivalence system for variable drugs. the applicant concluded 
 that in line with the protocol and based on the results of the reference scaled and unscaled approach, 
 be is demonstrated under fed conditions.</p><p>
 the study is considered to be supportive of the argument requested in the major objection but not valid 
 for the eu since the reference product used is sourced from the us market and since it is not performed 
 on the highest and most sensitive strength. the major objection raised due to the change of eu guidance 
 after submission was therefore considered to be resolved. 
 in terms of safety a total of 22 mild and 1 moderate aes were experienced by the subjects after taking 
 the test product. a total of 21 mild and 2 moderate aes were experienced by the subjects after taking 
 the reference product. no aes associated with clinical laboratory tests were experienced by the subjects 
 at post-study. no serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of this study. the two 
 products exhibited a similar safety profile.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.  
 conclusions on clinical aspects</header><p>based on the presented bioequivalence study 2185 dasatinib 140mg film coated tablets is considered bioequivalent with sprycel 140mg film coated tablets (dasatinib) in normal, healthy, male volunteers 
 under fasting conditions. this application was submitted prior to the publication of the updated product 
 specific bioequivalence guideline for dasatinib hence a fasting study is appropriate. a supportive fed 
 study was also submitted however this cannot be considered as an extra study since the reference 
 product used is that of the us and the study was done on the 100mg strength (which is not the highest 
 strength in the range proposed.) 
 the results of study 2185 with 140mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 20mg, 50mg, 
 70mg, 80mg, and 100mg, according to conditions in the relevant guidelines. kindly refer to the quality 
 sections for further information. 
 the product is approvable from a clinical point of view and all issues have been resolved.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 page 29/30</p><p>no nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
 from a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
 pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
 overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
 sufficient. 
 the bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a randomised, two-period, two-treatment 
 crossover design. the study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
 formulation and was in line with the respective european requirements. choice of dose, sampling 
 points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. the analytical method was 
 validated. pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
 the test formulation of dasatinib accordpharma met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence 
 when compared with the sprycel. the point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
 parameters auc0-t, auc0-72h, and cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance 
 range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
 a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.
