 “treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence (sui)” in august 2004.</p><p>the mah submitted this variation to update the section 4.1 of the summary of product characteristics (spc) to add the indication 
 &quot;diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (dpnp) in adults”.</p><p> 
 duloxetine is classified as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri). it is a selective 
 inhibitor of both serotonin (5-ht) and norepinephrine (ne) receptors. both 5-ht and ne have been 
 implicated in the mediation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms via the descending inhibitory 
 pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>
 diabetes is the leading cause of neuropathy in the western world, and neuropathy is the most common 
 complication and greatest source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients. the primary risk 
 factor for diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycaemia. the duration of diabetes also increases the risk of 
 neuropathy, but the association between duration and prevalence may depend in part upon patient age, 
 which itself is a risk factor. cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, height, and 
 hypercholesterolemia are all considered independent risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. neuropathic 
 pain can be defined as pain initiated or caused by primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. 
 they result from the damage to the nervous system leading to peripheral or central neuropathic pain. 
 patients affected by dpnp may benefit from duloxetine therapy.</p></section><section><header n="2">2.

 toxico-pharmacological aspects</header><p>no new non-clinical data that change the toxico-pharmacological profile of duloxetine have been submitted.</p><p>
 the effect of duloxetine in the treatment of dpnp has been studied in animals. the effect of 
 duloxetine in the treatment of dpnp is linked to its capacity to dose-dependently increase extracellular 
 levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. duloxetine normalised pain 
 thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, and attenuated pain 
 behaviour in a model of persistent pain. the pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is believed to be a 
 result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.</p><p>
 an environmental risk assessment that has been conducted in accordance with article 8 (ca) and (g) of 
 directive 2001/83/ec as amended was provided. a phase ii ecotoxicity assessment has been 
 conducted. there was no evidence that the therapeutic use of duloxetine hydrochloride in europe and 
 its subsequent discharge to sewage treatment plants will have negative consequences for the 
 environment.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. 
 clinical aspects</header><p>the efficacy of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain (dpnp) was evaluated in two randomised, placebo-controlled acute studies (study hmaw-acute and study hmava-acute). 
 further safety data as well as long-term efficacy were provided in study f1j-mc-hmbt (28-week, 
 open-label, safety study) with the primary objective of gathering safety data in the treatment of painful 
 symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy, as well as study f1j-mc-hmaw – extension (52-
 week extension phase of study hmaw) giving further safety data on duloxetine in comparison with 
 routine care.</p><p>
 the mah declared that the two clinical studies presented in this submission were conducted in 
 accordance with the good clinical practice.</p><p>2/7 © emea 2008

 the 
 objectives of both studies were similar; to compare the efficacy of duloxetine in different doses with placebo on the reduction of pain severity in the acute treatment of patients who met criteria for 
 painful diabetic neuropathy but did not meet dsm-iv
 1 criteria for major depression. the study population</p><p>included in the studies were male or female outpatients at least 18 years of age with pain due to bilateral peripheral neuropathy caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. the pain must 
 have begun in the feet, with relatively symmetrical onset. daily pain should have been present for at 
 least 6 months. the diagnosis must have been confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the michigan 
 neuropathy screening instrument.</p><p>
 all analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat (itt) basis, meaning that data were analysed by the 
 treatment groups to which patients were randomly assigned. all randomly assigned patients were 
 included in patient baseline characteristic summaries, while all randomly assigned patients with a 
 baseline and at least one post-baseline value were included in the efficacy analyses.</p></section><section><header>study hmaw acute</header><p>study hmaw-acute was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, study comparing duloxetine 20 mg qd (once daily), 60 mg qd and 60 mg bid (twice daily) with placebo over 12 
 weeks of acute treatment in patients aged 
 ≥18 years with dpnp. the study consisted of two periods; a 1- to 2-week screening phase during which patients were screened for eligibility and a 12-week period 
 of double blind acute treatment.</p><p>
 the protocol-specified that primary efficacy evaluation in this study was a comparison between the 
 duloxetine 60 mg bid and placebo treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment, using repeated 
 measures analysis of the change from baseline in the primary efficacy analysis, the 24-hour average 
 pain scale. results from the repeated measures analysis were consistent with those from the mean 
 change analysis.</p><p>
 results from the primary efficacy measure show that doses of duloxetine 60 mg qd and 60 mg bid 
 were statistically significantly better than placebo in the reduction of the severity of pain, which was 
 seen from the first week after starting treatment to the end of the acute phase. no differences were 
 seen between 60 mg bid and 60 mg qd or between 20 mg qd and placebo. the responders rate 
 using a more strict criteria (50% reduction in pain severity) were 52%, 49%, 41% and 26% for 
 duloxetine 60 mg bid, 60 mg qd, 20 mg qd and placebo, respectively, which were statistically 
 significantly superior for the three dosage regimen of duloxetine compared with placebo.</p><p>
 overall, results from secondary measures [response rates, the brief pain inventory (bpi) – severity 
 and interference, the clinical global impressions of severity (cgi-severity),the patient’s global 
 impressions of improvement (pgi improvement), the sensory portion of the short-form mcgill pain 
 questionnaire (sf-mpq), dynamic allodynia, the beck depression inventory-ii (bdi-ii), the beck 
 anxiety inventory</p><p>(bai), and the hamd17; health outcome measures: the 36-item short-form 
 health survey (sf-36), the euro-qol questionnaire – 5 day (eq-5d)] were consistent with those 
 from the primary endpoints, except for dynamic allodynia, most items of bpi-interference scale and 
 bai, bdiii</p><p>scores. quality of life measures showed a statistically significant improvement in the body 
 pain and mental health domain, with only numerical differences in the remaining aspects such as the 
 physical and social functioning.</p><p>

 ≥18 years with dpnp.</p><p> 
 the primary efficacy evaluation in this study was a comparison between the duloxetine 60 mg bid 
 and placebo treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment, using mean change analysis of the change 
 from baseline in the primary efficacy analysis, the 24-hour average pain scale. duloxetine 60 mg qd 
 and duloxetine 60 mg bid were both statistically significantly better than placebo at reducing the 24-
 hour average pain score in the mean change analysis in study hmava-acute. again, an analysis of 
 the score using repeated measures showed duloxetine 60 mg qd and duloxetine 60 mg bid were 
 statistically significantly better than placebo at reducing the score from one week after starting therapy 
 to the end of the acute therapy phase. the rate of responders using the strict definition were 53%, 43% 
 and 27% for duloxetine 60 mg bid, 60 mg qd and placebo groups, respectively.</p></section><section><header>bioequivalence</header><p>all strengthsare capsules which contain the same pellets of duloxetine in different amount, therefore these capsules are proportional and no problems of bioequivalence between these capsules are 
 expected. this means that 20 mg plus 40 mg is equivalent to 60 mg, thus corresponds to the 
 recommending dose for the dpnp indication.</p></section><section><header>conclusions on efficacy</header><p>in the two pivotal studies, the difference for duloxetine 60 mg qd and 60 mg bid compared with placebo in pain reduction varied between 1.17 – 1.45, on a 0-10 lickert scale. this difference is 
 statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). the statistical significance demonstrated for the primary endpoint 
 was based on an itt analysis for change from baseline to endpoint using locf.</p><p>
 the proposed dosage regimen is 60 mg once daily, which could be titrated up to 120 mg per day if an 
 adequate pain relief, is not achieved. the dosage recommendation was supported by the study 
 hmava in which the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily were 
 consistently superior to placebo. the proposal to up-titrate to a maximum of 120 mg/day in those 
 patients with an insufficient response was not clearly supported by these results, since 60 mg bid was 
 not statistically significantly superior to 60 mg qd in any study. however, it is recognised that studies 
 were not powered to show statistically significant differences between dosages. duloxetine 120 
 mg/day was numerically superior to the lower dose for the primary endpoint and also for most of the 
 secondary endpoints, including the responders’ rate (for which a difference of up to 10% between 
 dosages was seen). therefore, it must be recognised that some patients might benefit from the highest 
 dose.</p><p>
 the rate of response was also statistically significantly superior for duloxetine 60 mg bid and 60 mg 
 qd compared with placebo (around 50% vs. 26% for duloxetine 60 mg bid/qd and placebo, 
 respectively, using the strict criteria), which was also clinically relevant.</p><p>
 about 30% of the patients reported no benefit of the active medicinal product.</p><p>
 hitherto there was no way to identify responders or non-responders but to use the product ex juvantibus
 . if a response has not been achieved within 60 days, this seems to indicate a persistent non-response. the spc states that the response should be evaluated after 2 months of treatment and that 
 additional response after this time is unlikely.</p><p>
 overall, results from secondary measures were consistent with those from the primary endpoints, 
 except for dynamic allodynia, and some items of bpi-interference scale. consistency between studies 
 and between the repeated measure analysis and the mean change analysis were also demonstrated.</p><p>4/7 © emea 2008

 primarily designed to evaluate the safety of duloxetine over long-term administration. the extension 
 phase of study hmaw compared duloxetine 60 mg bid with routine care over 52 weeks of 
 treatment, while in study hmbt, duloxetine 60 mg bid and 120 mg qd were administered open-
 label over 28 weeks of treatment.</p><p>
 patient exposure and demographics</p><p>the primary dpnp data safety database comprised a total of 1074 patients who were exposed to duloxetine for the equivalent to 471.7 patient years. among these patients, 484 had 
 ≥6 months of exposure to duloxetine, and 158 had 
 ≥12 months of exposure to duloxetine. the demographic characteristics of the treatment groups and databases were generally consistent. patients in the primary 
 safety database were of both genders but predominantly caucasian men aged between 20 and 88 years. 
 the higher prevalence of males in these studies is likely related to the fact that patients with 
 depression, which is more common in females, were excluded. however, enough females were 
 included in the database to allow for an adequate safety assessment.</p><p>
 deaths in the entire clinical program involving over 11,000 individuals 29 deaths were reported. the reported deaths are what might be expected from these patient populations and do not suggest medicinal 
 product toxicity. cardiac-related deaths were the most frequent and appear to be related to underlying 
 heart disease and patients’ advancing age. there was no evidence of deaths related to qt 
 prolongation.</p><p>
 adverse events nausea was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring at the beginning of treatment and decreasing over time. the most common aes were nausea (23.6%), somnolence (15.5%), dizziness 
 (13.4%), insomnia (10.2 %), constipation (11.3 %). diarrhoea, fatigue, dry mouth, and hyperhydrosis 
 occurred in 5-10% of the duloxetine patients.</p><p>
 the safety profile of duloxetine in the claimed indication was similar, although numerically superior 
 to that seen in other indications, with the only exception of somnolence for which a statistically 
 significant difference were noted (reported in up to 23.9% in dpnp vs. 13.4% in other duloxetine-
 treated patients indications). this could be explained because population enrolled in clinical 
 development for dpnp were older, with higher concomitant medications and concurrent illnesses.</p><p>
 nausea and diarrhoea tended to appear early in duloxetine treatment and subside quickly, whilst 
 somnolence, dizziness, constipation and dry mouth decreased slightly over time and insomnia, fatigue 
 and hyperhidrosis seemed to persist during treatment with duloxetine.</p><p>
 most adverse events were reported as mild or moderate. severe adverse events tended to be more 
 commonly reported in females and in patients older than 75 years old. however, these were not 
 considered of clinical relevance, and the data provided demonstrated that the safety profile of 
 duloxetine in patients older than 75 years old was consistent to that seen in younger patients.</p><p>
 in the long-term studies, the incidence of teaes in duloxetine-treated patients was relatively low and 
 confirmed the safety profile obtained in the short-term studies.</p><p>
 a total of 214 (19.9%) patients discontinued due to adverse events in the primary safety database. this 
 was slightly higher than that seen in previous indications (9.5% vs. 13.9%), and maybe due to the 
 higher proportion of elderly patients, more prone to suffer adverse events. the most frequently 
 reported adverse events associated with discontinuation for all duloxetine treatment groups were 
 nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. a total of 135 (20.1%) patients discontinued due to aes in</p><p>5/7 © emea 2008 
 medicinal product no longer authorised</p><p> the long-term dpnp dataset. the most frequently reported adverse events associated with discontinuation were consistent to that seen in the placebo-controlled studies.</p><p>
 when discontinuing duloxetine after more than 1 week of therapy, it is generally recommended that 
 the dose be tapered over no less than 2 weeks before discontinuation in an effort to decrease the risk of 
 discontinuation symptoms. as a general recommendation, the dose should be reduced by half or 
 administered on alternate days during this period. the precise regimen followed should however take 
 into account the individual circumstances of the patient, such as duration of treatment, dose at 
 discontinuation, etc.</p><p>
 as with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases 
 of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after 
 treatment discontinuation. adequate warning information on reported casesof suicidal ideation and 
 behaviour with the use of duloxetine has been included in the spc. the spc also requests close 
 supervision for patients who report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time.</p><p>
 with the exception of hepatic enzymes, small and clinically insignificant changes in laboratory 
 analytes were seen across the databases, with very few instances of potentially clinically significant 
 abnormal laboratory values. small increases in mean values for aspartate transaminase (ast), alanine 
 transaminase (alt), and alkaline phosphatase (alkph) were seen, but these were not accompanied 
 by clinical symptoms in the vast majority of patients, and there is little to suggest that duloxetine alone 
 is likely to be the cause of significant hepatotoxicity. duloxetine has been shown to be associated with 
 a mild, transient elevation of alt and ast. these elevations were not dose related and not associated 
 with adverse events. rarely, patients taking duloxetine while consuming large amounts of alcohol 
 have been found to have significant elevations of alt and ast, as well as elevated bilirubin. no 
 patients have died as a result of liver failure or sustained permanent liver injury.</p><p>
 the safety profile in various demographic groups was found to be similar. although there were 
 younger patients than older and more males than females, there were sufficient numbers in the smaller 
 groups to allow for robust conclusions.</p><p>
 overall the safety profile was as expected for a medicinal product with this pharmacological profile. 
 no unexpected, serious adverse events were detected in the dpnp programme.</p></section><section><header n="4">4 pharmacovigilance

 the efficacy of duloxetine in the new dpnp indication has been examined in clinical studies of 
 patients with dpnp in doses up to 60 mg bid. strong evidence in support of the effectiveness of 
 duloxetine in both oncedaily (60 mg qd) and twice-daily (60 mg bid) dosing regimens has been 
 demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled clinical studies: hmava - acute and hmaw - 
 acute.</p><p>6/7 © emea 2008

 in both studies, duloxetine was statistically significantly superior to placebo in improvement of the a priori-declared primary outcome measure, the 24-hour average pain score. in addition, duloxetine was 
 statistically significantly superior to placebo in demonstrating response and sustained response on the 
 24-hour average pain score, which is a clinical relevant measure of pain relief.</p><p>
 in terms of safety, the absence of serious idiosyncratic toxicity in the development of duloxetine. 
 there was no evidence to suggest that deaths in the clinical study program were associated with use of 
 duloxetine and no clear pattern in the incidence or nature of serious adverse events (saes) to suggest 
 systemic drug toxicity. systematic review of possible cardiovascular effects, including blood pressure 
 changes and changes in qtc intervals, did not reveal any noteworthy impact or safety hazard. nausea 
 is the most frequently reported adverse event, usually occurring at the beginning of treatment and 
 decreasing quickly over time. small increases in mean values for the hepatic enzymes were seen, but 
 these were not accompanied by clinical symptoms in the vast majority of patients, and there is little to 
 suggest that duloxetine alone is likely to be the cause of significant hepatotoxicity. the issue of the 
 hepatic reactions may be closely monitored. in the long-term studies, the incidence of teaes in 
 duloxetine-treated patients was low and comparable to routine care; no event occurred significantly 
 more often in duloxetine treated patients than in those patients treated with routine care. therefore, 
 there is no evidence of additional tolerability concerns with chronic duloxetine dosing.</p><p>
 based on the chmp review of safety and efficacy, the chmp considers that the benefit-risk for 
 duloxetine dihydrochloride indicated in 
 ‘diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (dpnp) in adults’, is favourable and recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation.</p><p>
