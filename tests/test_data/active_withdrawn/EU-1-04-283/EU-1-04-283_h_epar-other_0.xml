   increases in inr values were reported when duloxetine was 
 co-administered with warfarin. however, concomitant 
 administration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady 
 state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical 
 pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant 
 change in inr from baseline or in the pharmacokinetics of 
 warfarin.

 based on the review of the available information the chmp 
 is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
 of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
 sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
 benefit/risk profile of ariclaim continues to be favourable.
   the mah will continue to submit a yearly psur.
   within this application the mah did not request the renewal 
 of the 20 and 40 mg presentations of ariclaim and 
 therefore ariclaim will no longer be indicated in the

 a new data lock point for all placebo-controlled clinical 
 studies resulted in a significant increase in the size of the 
 overall database and thus a more robust basis for the 
 determination of adverse drug reactions (adrs). as a 
 consequence, the frequency of some adrs was updated in 
 the spc.
   regarding spontaneous data, the mah identified one new 
 adr (“restless legs syndrome”) as well as new information 
 on overdose in the most recent psur (psur 7) submitted 
 in september 2008, and updated the spc accordingly.
   finally, the mah has undertaken a user testing of the pl of 
 duloxetine-containing products and the results of these 
 were implemented in the pl.

 study ‘hmem’ was designed to investigate the maintenance

 diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (dpnp) who 
 responded to an initial 8 weeks of therapy.
   this variation application was submitted in order to update 
 the spc to reflect the results of study hmem. the study 
 demonstrated that, for patients who showed an initial 
 response to dpnp therapy with duloxetine, the pain relief 
 observed with duloxetine 60 mg is maintained over a 6-

  this section was updated to state that &apos;&apos;caution should be 
 exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral 
 anticoagulants or antiplatelets drugs due to an increased 
 risk of bleeding. furthermore, increases in inr values have 
 been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
 warfarin&quot;. in addition to this, the following information has 
 been included: duloxetine is an inhibitor of cyp2d6 and 
 therefore caution is advised when duloxetine is co-
 administered with medicinal products predominantly 
 metabolised by this route (i.e. risperidone, tricyclic 
 antidepressants such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and 
 imipramine).

   during the assessment of psur 1, 3 cases of siadh 
 (severe inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion), 7 
 cases of hyponatremia and 7 cases of blood sodium 
 decreased were reported. these cases involved elderly 
 patients (mean 76 years). in a number of cases risk factors 
 were identified (pre-existing low level of blood sodium, 
 renal failure, concomitant treatment with ace or diuretics).

 patients or patients treated with diuretics. hyponatraemia may reflect a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic 
 hormone secretion (siadh).
   during the assessment of psur 1, 12 cases of 
 gastrointestinal bleeding were reported. in a number of 
 cases risk factors were identified. nevertheless, there are a 
 number of epidemiological studies showing that drugs that 
 inhibit 5ht re-uptake increase the risk of bleeding, 
 including gastrointestinal bleeding. information has been 
 added to section 4.4 of the spc on that reports of 
 gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been seen.
   as an increase in approximately 2 mmhg mean increase in 
 blood pressure has been seen in patients treated with 
 duloxetine, information is added to section 4.4 of the spc 
 on that duloxetine is associated with an increase in blood 
 pressure in some patients. in patients with known 
 hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood pressure 
 monitoring is recommended as appropriate.
   cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver 
 enzymes (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and 
 jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section
