 about the disease 
 chronic pain is defined as pain that is present on most days and persists for longer than the normal 
 tissue healing time. it is a dynamic state in which different pathophysiological mechanisms play 
 different roles at different times in individually different subjects. more than 37 million people 
 worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with more than a third of the european union population 
 experiencing chronic pain at some point in their lives. clbp and oa are 2 of the most prevalent types 
 of chronic pain. 
 treatment guidelines / recommendations 
 three chmp guidelines are particularly relevant for the development of products in the intended 
 indication ‘chronic somatic pain’: note for “guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
 treatment of nociceptive pain” (cpmp/ewp/612/00), “guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
 products used in the treatment of osteoarthritis” (cpmp/ewp/784/97 rev. 1), and “guideline on clinical 
 medicinal products intended for the treatment of neuropathic pain” (cpmp/ewp/252/03).</p><p>
 scientific advice was requested on two occasions by the mah, in 2005 in relation to the development 
 programme for the treatment of chronic low back pain (clbp) (emea/h/sa/75/4/2005/ii), and in 2006 
 in relation to the development programme for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe chronic 
 pain (emea/h/sa/75/3/fu/1/2006/ii).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 - patients with bmi below 40; 
 - excluded diagnoses of mdd (as determined by mini international neuropsyquiatric interview (mini)); 
 - excluded concomitant use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antimanics, antipsychotics, capsaicin, 
 cimetidine, lidocaine, monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors, psychostimulants, quinolone class of 
 antibiotics, triptans, tryptophan, and tramadol. 
 in all studies the treatment groups seemed to be fairly well balanced with respect to demographics as 
 well as disease-related characteristics with the exception of study oa-fg in which there were more 
 females in the placebo group. however, this imbalance was not likely to introduce any bias in favour of 
 duloxetine since the effect tended to be more pronounced in females. of note the average age of 
 participants was 52-63 years. 
 osteoarthritis studies in the 2 oa studies male or female patients at least 40 years of age who meet the clinical and radiographic disease diagnosis criteria based upon american college of rheumatology (acr) 
 classification of idiopathic oa of the knee (knee pain, radiographic evidence of osteophytes, and at 
 least 1 of the following 3 conditions: age &gt;50 years, morning stiffness &lt;30 minutes, or crepitus) were

 to remain on the regular dose throughout the course of the study. nsaids or acetaminophen were also 
 allowed as rescue therapy in all studies. 
 randomisation was stratified by nsaid use in all studies (except for study clbp-gc) allowing 
 descriptive comparison of patients concomitantly using nsaids with duloxetine and those on 
 duloxetine alone. an nsaid user was defined as a patient who takes an nsaid for 
 ≥ 14 days per month for 3 months prior to study entry. prior to randomisation, patients were required to wash out of 
 all other analgesics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. use of non-pharmacological therapy was 
 allowed provided this was being used at the time of enrolment; the studies did not collect data on use 
 of non-pharmacological therapies.</p></section><section><header>objectives</header><p>the objective of the studies was to assess the duloxetine’s efficacy in reducing pain in patients with osteoarthritic pain and chronic low back pain, and safety after 12 or 13 weeks of treatment.</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>the primary outcome measure for all studies was change in pain severity, assessed using average pain ratings on an 11-point numerical rating scale (ranging from 0 for no pain to 10 for worst pain 
 imaginable) from baseline to the end-of-treatment.</p><p>
 the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain rating (collected from electronic patient diaries) was 
 originally specified as the primary efficacy outcome for all chronic somatic pain studies except for study 
 clbp-gc. however, the overall electronic diary compliance rate was low in the first two studies 
 analysed (68% for study oa-ep and 49% for study clbp-eo). therefore, the 24-hour average pain 
 item rating collected from brief pain inventory (bpi) at study visits was specified as the primary 
 efficacy outcome for all other studies (oa-fg, clbp-en, and clbp-gc). 
 all studies employed a gatekeeper strategy for sequential testing of the following secondary objectives: 
 - effect of duloxetine versus placebo on patients’ perceived improvement during the treatment phase 
 as measured by the pgi-improvement (pgi-i). 
 - effect of duloxetine versus placebo on the change in patients’ physical function during the treatment 
 phase as measured by the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (womac) 
 physical function subscale (studies oa-fg and oa-ep) or by the roland-morris disability questionnaire 
 (rmdq-24), a questionnaire addressing intensity of clbp and its interference with activities of daily 
 living (studies clbp-en, clbp-eo, and clbp-gc). 
 response rates (using both 
 ≥30% and ≥50% reduction from baseline at endpoint criteria) were included as a secondary endpoint in all studies. 
 other (non-gatekeeper) secondary objectives were: weekly mean of the 24-hour worst pain and night 
 pain ratings (collected from electronic patient diaries); bpi severity and interference; clinical global 
 impressions of severity ratings; womac pain and stiffness subscales and total.</p><p>
 to evaluate whether the reduction in pain was a direct analgesic effect and was independent of 
 treatment effect on mood the athens insomnia scale (studies clbp-en, clbp-eo and clbp-gc); beck 
 depression inventory ii and hospital anxiety and depression scale (studies clbp-en, clbp-eo, oa-

 to assess the impact of treatment with duloxetine versus placebo on patient-reported health outcomes 
 the following tools were used: euro-quality of life questionnaire-5 dimensions (clbp-gc), 36-item</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 1:1 ratio was used in the re-randomisation in study oa-ep as well. all study drugs used were identical 
 in colour, shape, smell, and taste, and all patients took the same number of capsules regardless of 
 treatment group or dose.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>all analyses were conducted on an itt basis, i.e. data were analysed by the treatment groups to which patients were randomly assigned even if the patient did not take the assigned treatment or did not 
 comply with the protocol. to be included in the efficacy analyses patients had to have a baseline 
 measurement and at least one non-missing post-baseline measurement.</p><p>
 a likelihood based mixed effects model repeated measures (mmrm) analysis was used to analyse the 
 primary efficacy endpoint in all the studies.</p><p>
 the mah predefined to use the best of the series of (co)variance matrix according to the akaike’s 
 information criterion for the mmrm analyses. the analysis performed by the mah included the fixed 
 categorical effects of treatment, nsaid use (yes/no), investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit 
 interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline-by-visit 
 interaction. in addition to mmrm, analyses of covariance (ancova) using change from baseline to 
 bocf endpoint and change from baseline to locf endpoint were prespecified as sensitivity analyses 
 methods for the primary efficacy objective. 
 for response rate (30% and 50% pain reduction) and the key secondary outcomes used to assess 
 gatekeeper secondary objectives, analysis of locf endpoint (a priori specified analysis method), 
 mmrm analysis (for outcomes collected at multiple post-baseline visits) and analysis of bocf endpoint 
 (for sensitivity analyses) were performed. 
 three regression models were used to estimate the direct effect of treatment and the indirect effects 
 though change in bdi-ii and hads-a on the change on 24-hour average pain score.</p><p>
 interim analyses 
 in study clbp-en, when all subjects completed participation in the acute phase, the database was 
 validated and locked to perform statistical analysis on all subjects (since the study continues with the 
 extension phase, this analysis is referred to as an interim analysis). however, no adjustment to 
 significance level was necessary since this was the only (final) analysis of the double-blind, placebo-
 controlled part of the study.</p></section><section><header>results participants flow</header><p>the participants flow is presented in the table below. table 3. participants flow in oa and clbp studies.</p><p>

 *following re-randomisation 22 patients discontinued from duloxetine group. 
 **four patients discontinued following randomisation and before treatment. 
 overall, the discontinuation rate was higher in the duloxetine arms as compared to placebo with the exception of the study oa-ep. the treatment-related adverse events were the main reason for the 
 discontinuation in the duloxetine groups.</p></section><section><header>conduct of the study</header><p>all studies included investigational sites from european countries except for the study clbp-eo.</p><p>in studies oa-ep and clbp-eo electronic patient diaries were used to record pain severity. as the 
 overall electronic patient diary compliance over 13 weeks was low (68% and 49%, respectively), the 
 primary endpoint of studies clbp-en and oa-fg was changed from the weekly mean score of 24-hour 
 average pain severity ratings as collected from patient diaries to the bpi 24-hour average pain scores.</p><p>
 based on the change in the primary efficacy measure, some secondary efficacy analyses were changed. 
 response rate analyses and subgroup analyses of the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain score 
 from patient diaries were changed to the bpi average pain score. the bpi average pain score also 
 replaced the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain score from diaries for the path analysis of direct 
 analgesic effect. statements regarding study power were also revised.</p></section><section><header>numbers analysed</header><p>patients who did not have either a baseline or post-baseline measurement were excluded from the efficacy analyses.</p><p>
 study oa-fg: of the 256 randomised patients, 248 were analysed for the primary efficacy measure; 8 
 patients were excluded from the efficacy analyses. 
 study oa-ep: data from 108 of the 111 patients assigned to duloxetine and 119 of the 120 patients 
 randomly assigned to placebo were analysed for the primary efficacy measure; 4 patients were 
 excluded from the efficacy analyses.

 maintenance of effect was evaluated in the 41 week uncontrolled extension phase of study clbp-en in 
 58 patients. the hypothesis of maintained effect was tested in a non-inferiority analysis including 
 responders (&gt;30% reduction of baseline pain score) on duloxetine treatment during the double-blind 
 phase of the study. non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of a 97.5% one-sided 
 confidence interval for the change from the last available pain score during the double-blind phase to 
 the last available score during the extension phase was lower than 1.5. the observed upper bound was 
 -0.45. the maintenance of effect was studied in a limited number of patients.</p></section><section><header>study clbp-gc</header><p>table 8. analysis of the primary efficacy variable.</p><p>bpi 24-hour average pain (collected from study visits) study

 medicinal product no longer authorisednotes duloxetine 60/120 mg treated patients demonstrated statistically significant 
 improvement over placebo-treated patients in weekly 24-hour average pain 
 score, weekly 24-hour worst pain score, cgi-s, and most parameters of the 
 bpi (worst pain, least pain, average pain, pain right now, general activity 
 baseline, and normal work baseline). in the sf-36 health outcomes measure 
 for all randomised patients, the duloxetine-treated patients showed 
 significantly greater improvement on the sf-36 physical component 
 summary as well as the subscales of bodily pain, physical functioning, and 
 physical role. the path analysis revealed that improvements in pain scores 
 were due to a direct analgesic effect independent of changes in depression as 
 measured by bdi-ii or anxiety as measured by the hads-a subscale. 
 patients who did not respond to duloxetine 60 mg qd, and thus had their 
 dose increased to 120 mg qd (nonresponders), experienced a statistically 
 significant decrease (improvement) from baseline (week 7) to endpoint 
 (week 13) in the bpi average pain score. of this group, 27.3% met the 30% 
 response criteria (

 in secondary analyses including 8 out of 10 bpi items, weekly 24-hour 
 average pain score, weekly 24-hour worst pain, weekly 24-hour night pain 
 the differences between duloxetine and placebo reached statistical 
 significance. clinical global impressions of severity rating did not show 
 significant difference in the mean change from baseline to endpoint between 
 the treatment groups. no difference in the mean change of athens insomnia 
 scale (ais) between the treatment groups was found. overall, there was no 
 significant difference between the treatment groups in the mean change in 
 sf-36. there was a significantly greater improvement in the duloxetine 
 treatment group on the work activity impairment score compared with the 
 placebo treatment group using the wpai. the path analysis indicated that the 
 direct analgesic effect of duloxetine on pain was predominant.</p><p>

 there was no statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction for any of the subgroups 
 analysed indicating that the effect was similar regardless of subgroup. overall 88% of the patients 
 were caucasians. although no significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed it was noted 
 that the magnitude of effect was considerably less in patients using nsaids and in european oa 
 patients. as the difference was not statistically significant and the opposite phenomenon was observed 
 in the clbp studies it was concluded that no clinically meaningful regional differences were observed. 
 it was also noted that the effect was less pronounced in males (and not statistically significant for 
 males in oa patients) and in patients with &lt;1 year duration of clbp. however, the limited patient 
 numbers warranted caution in the interpretation of the results.

 regarding the basal characteristics, the patients’ mean age was 50+ years in all the studies. the mean 
 duration of chronic pain was between 7 and 12 years. the median baseline pain value was 6.0, which 
 is referred to as a moderate-severe pain. the chmp noted that the elderly population was 
 underrepresented in the submitted clinical trials.</p><p>
 the lack of an active comparator in all of the studies was considered as an important weakness of the 
 clinical development program in the intended indication.</p><p>
 the backbone treatment of patients with chronic pain disorders are non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
 drugs (nsaids). in fact, in all the studies but one (clbp-gc), patients were allowed to remain on their 
 regular dose of nsaids or acetaminophen, provided they were using them at the time of enrolment. 
 this is a key feature of the clinical development for the current application. undoubtedly, patients with 
 oa of knee or clbp are treated with analgesics and an overall basal pain rate of 6 could automatically 
 imply that these patients are being undertreated or that they have an inadequate response to nsaids 
 and may require an add-on medication, although due to the lack of criteria to properly define the 
 population, this fact cannot be confirmed. patients with moderate pain who were not receiving nsaids</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 32/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedwere also included in the studies at a different proportion. the fact that both groups of patients were included in the studies is considered an important drawback of the clinical development program in 
 chronic somatic pain. these scenarios are considered as completely different, the expected contribution 
 of each population to the overall benefit is different and the overall benefit not necessarily applicable to 
 each of them. the broader indication initially sought by the applicant namely ‘treatment of moderately 
 severe chronic somatic pain’ cannot be supported by the current clinical development program. in 
 other words, the target patient population should have been properly defined. consequently, the 
 inclusion of analgesics in the study can be seen as a methodological flaw which renders difficult the 
 interpretation of the outcomes. 
 the chmp also expressed concerns regarding the handling of missing data and its impact on the 
 estimated treatment effects due to the differences in results observed with different analytical 
 approaches, i.e. bocf versus mmrm or locf. the mah carried out additional exploratory analyses to 
 further characterise the drop-outs with the focus on non-nsaid users (i.e., not taking nsaids 
 regularly) as this population was the only one showing some benefit from the duloxetine treatment. 
 the results demonstrated that in three of the studies (oa-ep, oa-fg and clbp-en) time to 
 discontinuation was in favour of duloxetine thus substantiating, in view of the applicant, the treatment 
 effect. most of the discontinuations were due to the adverse events in the active treatment group. the 
 chmp agreed that handling of the missing data would not change the conclusions from the studies.</p><p>
 the adequacy of blinding of the studies and their external validity was also questioned by the chmp. it 
 was not clear to the committee whether study participants or investigators could have identified the 
 treatment assignment based on ae-related discontinuation from studies as the data on clinical 
 characteristics of trials non-completers was missing. in response the applicant provided data on 
 baseline characteristics of patients who did not complete the studies. from the data submitted it 
 transpired that there were only slight differences between patients who discontinued and those who 
 completed the studies, hence the chmp concluded that the integrity of blinding was adequately 
 preserved. furthermore, the chmp expressed reservations as to how the potential participants were 
 identified and recruited. in their response the mah clarified how the recruitment process was organised 
 and why some patients were excluded prior to randomisation. it was concluded that given the 
 modalities of the recruitment process (e.g. advertising campaigns) the 30% screen failures were 
 acceptable. 
 additionally, the mah was requested to clarify the impact of low patients’ compliance with electronic 
 diaries on validity and integrity of the studies oa-ep and clbp-eo. the applicant explained that other 
 data collected within these studies which were not reliant on the compliance with diaries, e.g. data 
 collected using bpi demonstrated changes in favour of duloxetine. nonetheless, the applicant 
 considered these studies as supportive for the procedure due to inconsistent or negative results. the 
 chmp acknowledged the applicant’s response that albeit valid the studies do not provide information 
 supporting the applied for indication.</p><p>
 efficacy data and additional analyses with regards to the outcomes, the primary endpoints results were statistically significant in four out of five studies. the 24-hour average pain reduction with duloxetine ranged from -1.9 to -2.9, whereas for 
 placebo it ranged from -1.25 to -2.1. these results are positive in statistical terms, nevertheless their 
 clinical relevance is highly questionable. in fact, the absolute difference between placebo and 
 duloxetine ranged between 0.40 and 0.84, which raises the question as to whether such difference 
 would be perceived by patients. interestingly, the estimated minimal perceptible clinical improvement, 
 in a 100 mm normalised vas, has been observed to be in the range of 8 to 12 mm (ehrich et al. 2000 
 j rheumatol). the minimal clinically important improvement was also determined by f. tubach et al. in</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 33/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe 2005 publication ‘evaluation of clinically relevant changes in patient reported outcomes in knee and hip osteoarthritis: the minimal clinical important improvement’. the authors concluded that at best 
 patients could perceive 1.08 points of pain decrease from baseline score, a change that could be 
 considered the minimal clinical important improvement. it could be reasonable to think that differences 
 between control and duloxetine group should be at least of 1 point to be deemed clinically relevant. 
 in this context it is also worth highlighting the importance of performing studies where the substance 
 under investigation is tested against both placebo and an active control. in the publication ‘efficacy and 
 safety of etoricoxib 30 mg and celecoxib 200 mg in the treatment of osteoarthritis in two identically 
 designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority studies’ (bingham et al, 2007) the non-
 inferiority margin was predefined as ±10 mm on a 100 mm vas. in addition, differences between 
 tested products (etoricoxib and celecoxib) and placebo were always greater than 11 points (100 mm 
 vas). in ‘efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg/day and diclofenac 150 mg/day in reduction of pain and 
 disability in patients with chronic low back pain: results of a 4-week, multinational, randomized, 
 double-blind study’ (zerbini et al, 2005) the non-inferiority margin was set at the same level (±10 mm 
 on a 100mm). 
 this further evidences the lack of a clinically relevant effect of duloxetine on pain relief as differences 
 between duloxetine and placebo were not greater than 1 point on a 10 mm scale in any of the studies 
 (which falls within the generally accepted non-inferiority margin in chronic pain studies). 
 in response to the chmp request the mah performed two additional sensitivity analyses using the 
 locf and a modified bocf. the observed results were pointing in the same direction, i.e. positive 
 statistical result and absence of clinical relevance when duloxetine was compared to placebo. of note, 
 although initially not fully supported by the chmp the statistical methods were considered acceptable 
 as mmrm constitutes a recognised tool in the assessment of pain. however, the difference between the 
 results of bocf and mmrm analyses provided an excellent case study of why mmrm may not be 
 suitably conservative in this indication. in this regard it should be highlighted that when designing 
 studies there should be sufficient evidence that the primary variable selected can provide a valid and 
 reliable measure of a clinically relevant and important treatment benefit in the patient population 
 described by the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>
 the “guideline on clinical medicinal products intended for the treatment of neuropathic pain” 
 (cpmp/ewp/252/03) recommends defining responders as subjects with a 30 to 50% reduction in the 
 assessment scale as compared to baseline. response rate comparison was recommended as primary 
 endpoint for clbp studies in the scientific advice received in 2005. thus, response rates (using both 
 ≥30% and ≥50% reduction from baseline at endpoint criteria) were included as a secondary endpoint in all studies, with 80% power to detect a treatment difference between duloxetine and placebo. it should 
 be emphasised that demonstrating a numeric decrease even though statistically significant would not 
 be sufficient to demonstrate a clinically relevant response. 
 in the 30% response rate analysis, according to the locf, the difference between duloxetine 60 mg 
 and placebo ranged from 8.2% to 21.2%. based on the bocf method the results showed a difference 
 from 7.1% to 14.5%. in the 50% response rate analysis, the difference between duloxetine and 
 placebo was from 5.3% to 17.8% (locf) and 4.3% to 14.8% (bocf). in summary, at best 20% of 
 difference between placebo and duloxetine could be observed using the 30% response rate. even 
 though somebody could wonder whether these results (response rate) may be deemed as relevant for 
 a subset of patients, no criteria have been proposed to select a subgroup of subjects in whom some 
 clinical benefit could be reached.</p><p>
 interestingly, when the primary analysis was carried out in the subgroup of patients treated with 
 nsaids during the course of the study, the statistical significance disappeared. on the contrary, only</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 34/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe patients without nsaids intake (i.e., not taking nsaids regularly) demonstrated a positive result. consequently, the applicant provided additional analyses, including primary efficacy outcome analysis 
 and responder analyses, in subgroups of patients defined as non-nsaid users (i.e., not taking nsaids 
 regularly).</p><p>
 regarding studies in clbp differences in favour of duloxetine were of -0.54 in clbp-en, -0.64 in clbp-
 eo (60 mg strength) and -0.55 clbp-gc, the latter can be considered as the study which better shows 
 the use of duloxetine alone as no nsaids were allowed. therefore in terms of the primary endpoint, 
 results showed mean differences in favour of duloxetine of about 0.55 points on an 11-point scale, 
 which can hardly be considered as clinically relevant. 
 differences in 30% response rates were of 13.3 % in study clbp-en, 15.4% in study clbp-eo, and 
 7.1% in clbp-gc. differences in 50% response rates were 15.5 % in study clbp-en, 10.1% in study 
 clbp-eo, and 14.8% in clbp-gc. 
 in the oa studies pain reduction measured by the primary endpoint was -0.60 in oa-ep and -0.67 in 
 oa-fg both in favour of duloxetine. when assessing bpi 30% response rates in oa studies results 
 showed differences in favour of duloxetine of 9.1% and 14.6% in study oa-ep and oa-fg respectively. 
 these differences were of 23% and 9.3% for 50% response rate respectively, suggesting high 
 variability between oa studies. interestingly, when looking at the primary endpoint results seemed to 
 be more favourable, however when looking at response rates they showed the same magnitude. once 
 again, these analyses of subsets cannot be considered as confirmatory. 
 in the scientific advice held on 2005 the chmp concluded that ‘the choice of only placebo as the control 
 arm in studies of clbp with duloxetine as add-on therapy to a well-established analgesic regimen 
 would be acceptable as long as utilisation of all concomitant treatments was recorded, analysed and 
 reported’. regarding the oa chmp answer followed the same trend (sa held on 2006): if duloxetine 
 was intended as a first line therapy a three arm study was recommended including one arm with any 
 available nsaid indicated for the symptomatic treatment of oa. on the other hand, if duloxetine was 
 intended as a rescue therapy, the pain threshold for non responders should have been properly 
 defined. the use of analgesics was not thoroughly recorded in the studies. no active comparator was 
 included in the trials nor was proper definition of non-responder to nsaids pre-specified. taking into 
 account deviations from the above advices it is difficult to identify the target population for duloxetine 
 in the current application. in the absence of an accepted comparator and in order to put findings into 
 perspective the applicant provided several analyses with the use of historical comparators; however 
 given the limitations of such approach these data are unlikely to be sufficient. 
 the fact that a noteworthy therapeutic effect (30% response rate) needs more than 20 days to be 
 reached by the vast majority of patients makes duloxetine less suitable for being considered as 
 monotherapy in chronic pain.</p><p>
 finally, the use of rescue medication has not been reported in all the studies. moreover, the secondary 
 variables did not include this important endpoint. this issue is a matter of concern, since the recording 
 of pain severity could have been modified if the patient had taken rescue medication in previous 
 hours/days before the study’s visit. according to “note for guidance on clinical investigation of 
 medicinal products used in the treatment of oa” for all trials ‘rescue treatment (including physical 
 therapy) should be standardised, monitored carefully and recorded for each individual patient. time 
 points of endpoint assessment should be appropriately chosen to avoid confounding effects of the 
 rescue medication’. additionally in “note for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
 treatment of nociceptive pain” it is stated that ‘special attention should be given to concomitant 
 medications or nonpharmacological pain management techniques. if unavoidable, any treatment that 
 can modulate the perception on pain should be comparable across study groups’.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 35/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe pre-specified definition of episodic use would be acceptable and would not have constituted a potential bias if the use of rescue medication had been properly recorded. only data on days of 
 concomitant rescue therapy have been provided. total number of days of rescue analgesic use ranged 
 from 1 to 16 for duloxetine-treated patients and 1 to 35 for placebo-treated patients. this is 
 reassuring, albeit information on actual days of rescue therapy consumption is lacking. to what extent 
 the use of rescue therapies could have affected the effects of duloxetine is still unknown. taking into 
 account these unknowns and the complete lack of data on non-pharmacological interventions the 
 possible role of duloxetine alone in pain relief is still uncertain. 
 the results supporting maintenance of effect were considered to have a very limited value as only 58 
 patients completed the open-label extension part of the study clbp-en, and the statistical approach 
 used (locf) was likely to overestimate the effect. an updated analysis including 61 patients, a more 
 conservative delta margin and using the bocf method for missing data imputation showed that in up 
 to 64% of the patients the response was maintained. despite that, these results were considered to 
 provide a very limited evidence to support the use of duloxetine for the treatment of this chronic 
 condition.</p><p>
 the chmp noted that numbers of elderly patients participating in duloxetine oa/clbp clinical trials 
 were limited (181 duloxetine-treated patients were 65-75 years old; 21.6%) especially in the subset of 
 the very elderly (56 duloxetine-treated patients were 
 ≥75 years old; 6.7%).</p><p>having considered all the above stated the applicant restricted the indication to patients in whom 
 duloxetine showed to have the most noticeable effect, i.e. patients receiving duloxetine in 
 ‘monotherapy’ (patients not taking nsaids regularly). results for this subset were submitted as per 
 the bocf approach showing differences between placebo and duloxetine of 0.55 and 0.67. it should be 
 noted that only 2 out of 5 studies (study clbp-gc and oa-fg) turned out to be statistically significant. 
 even if considering the most favourable analysis for duloxetine, i.e. subgroup analyses with locf 
 approach, duloxetine-placebo differences ranged from 0.60 (study clbp-gc) to 1.03 (study oa-fg). 
 the latter could be deemed as a result of borderline clinical relevance. however the following should be 
 highlighted: firstly the bocf approach (0.67) differs substantially from the locf approach; secondly, 
 this can be considered an isolated result as no other study showed clinical relevance; thirdly, all the 
 concerns already raised and not resolved as well as concerns regarding the heterogeneity of the target 
 population, i.e. the population included in trials was not adequately defined, as patients not taking 
 nsaids were included in trials irrespective of the reason for not using them, play down the importance 
 of this isolated result. furthermore, in the clinical studies presented, patients taking nsaids for less 
 than 15 days per month, during at least 3 consecutive months, were considered as ‘non-nsaids users’ 
 and were allowed to continue this regimen during clinical trial, which questions the definition of a 
 monotherapy setting and adds further uncertainties to the contribution of duloxetine to the observed 
 effect. 
 considering the marginal differences between duloxetine and placebo in pain intensity reduction, the 
 applicant was requested to clarify the contribution of the effect of duloxetine on depression/anxiety to 
 the analgesic effect. the mah submitted new analyses in addition to the initial path analysis performed 
 to test the direct effect of duloxetine treatment on pain reduction. although the method was accepted 
 results showed rates around 20% for studies clbp-en and clbp-eo which were considered as non 
 negligible. logistic regression of 30% response rate has been performed including hads-d and bdi-ii 
 total scores as covariates (based on the fact that path analyses showed that depression status 
 contributed to the majority of the indirect effect rather that anxiety). based on the results of this post-
 hoc analysis, the chmp agreed that the effect of duloxetine was mainly due to its analgesic properties 
 rather than its effects on mood or anxiety.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorisedalthough no new information was submitted that could change the chmp’s opinion regarding the marginal clinical efficacy of duloxetine, the submitted subgroup analysis results enabled the committee 
 to state the following: 
 • 
 the modest clinical effects observed in the overall population are mostly driven by patients 
 receiving duloxetine alone. 
 •

 considered the most favoured population, however the observed effect is still considered of scarce

 negligible.</p><p>
 • 
 the unknown contribution of the rescue medication to the overall effect adds further 
 uncertainties to the efficacy assessment.

 in the absence of an active comparator, it is difficult to reach any conclusion on the benefit/risk

 condition in monotherapy.

 the heterogeneity of the studied population makes it difficult to elucidate the potential effect of 
 duloxetine in the intended target population.

 clinical safety</header></section><section><header>patient exposure</header><p>the integrated safety database for duloxetine hydrochloride currently consists of more than 31,000 patients exposed to duloxetine in the entire clinical program as of 23 april 2010. these exposures 
 include 4039 additional patients exposed to duloxetine since the datalock of may 2007 for the 
 fibromyalgia submission in the us. of these additional exposures, 1860 duloxetine-treated patients 
 participated in placebo-controlled studies. the database includes safety data for individual patient 
 exposures over 5 years (that is, a maximum duration of patient exposure of 2115 days), with similar 
 safety results observed between acute treatment (12 weeks) and long-term treatment. in addition to 
 clinical trials, more than 31 million patients have been exposed to duloxetine based on postmarketing 
 experience (through 02 august 2010). patients 
 ≥65 years of age comprise 13.8% of the clinical trial population and 18.1% of the postmarketing population. 
 in this submission, 839 patients were treated with duloxetine in placebo-controlled clinical studies for 
 osteoarthritis (oa) and chronic low back pain (clbp) using doses of 20, 60, and 120 mg once daily</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 ≥90 days of exposure to duloxetine. safety data from these studies were pooled to form the primary placebo-controlled analyses set for this submission. safety 
 analyses included all patients with baseline data. 
 additionally, 83 (55.3 patient-years) patients who completed the acute phase from study clbp-en 
 (hmen) were exposed to duloxetine for long-term treatment (up to 41 weeks), the remaining patients 
 discontinued primarily due to subject decision (12%), ae (6%), and protocol violation (6%).</p></section><section><header>adverse events</header><p>of the 839 enrolled patients in the primary placebo-controlled chronic pain studies, 61.5% reported at least one teae. nausea (13.9%), dry mouth (7.0%), constipation (6.9%, insomnia (6.6%), diarrhoea 
 (5.7%), dizziness (5.7%), somnolence (5.6%), and fatigue (5.0%), all were reported at a significantly 
 greater level compared to placebo and by more than 5% of patients. 
 the profile of ae observed in this application was similar, although numerically lower than that seen in 
 other placebo controlled studies or in all duloxetine exposures. the lower frequency of nausea could be 
 explained by the use of 30 mg as lead-in dose as well as by the recommendation of duloxetine being 
 administered with food.</p><p>
 • 
 common aes by severity 
 another measure of tolerability apart from the discontinuation rate was the severity of the events as 
 reported by patients. patients were asked to rate aes as mild, moderate, or severe based upon the 
 discomfort, health risk, interference with activity, or any combination of the 3. no teae-by-severity 
 analysis was performed for the all duloxetine exposures analyses set. for all aes, statistical 
 comparison was conducted to compare percentages of patients with severe teaes between treatment 
 groups. all common adverse events graded as severe were more frequent in the duloxetine groups and 
 the differences were statistically significant. 
 overall, the teae profile by severity of the primary placebo-controlled analyses set was similar to the 
 all other placebo-controlled analyses set and the primary long-term analyses set. this consistency 
 provides reassurance that chronic pain indication does not differ substantially from other indications in 
 terms of severity of the common aes. 
 • 
 common aes over the time 
 the analysis of the most common adverse events over the time showed that nausea, constipation, 
 insomnia, diarrhoea, dizziness, and somnolence appeared early in duloxetine treatment and subsided 
 quickly, whereas fatigue and dry mouth seemed to persist significantly longer in patients assigned to 
 duloxetine than in patients assigned to placebo. 
 • 
 common adverse events by demographic subgroups and dose 
 the frequency of adverse events was examined as function of age, gender and origin for the primary 
 placebo-controlled analyses set. a statistically significant difference for the treatment-by-strata 
 analyses was defined as p&lt;.10. males may have an increased risk of experiencing at least one ae, as 
 well as decreased libido compared to females, while an increased risk of dry mouth is indicated for 
 females compared to males, and younger patients may have an increased risk of nausea as compared 
 to older patients. 
 adverse events by dose were analysed in the fixed-dose study clbp-eo and across 3 studies which 
 included a one-time duloxetine dose increase (clbp-en, oa-ep and oa-fg). due to the fact that aes 
 tended to appear early in duloxetine treatment and subside quickly (with the exception of fatigue and</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 38/75</p><p>

 oa-fg introduced 120 mg dose by dose escalation or re-randomisation at visit 4). except for nausea 
 all common aes occurred numerically more frequently with duloxetine 120 mg than 60 or 20 mg qd. 
 all sexual-dysfunction effects combined were reported significantly more frequently by patients taking 
 duloxetine 120 mg qd than patients taking duloxetine 60 mg qd.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events and deaths</header><p>deaths no deaths were reported during the primary chronic pain studies, including the extension phase of 
 study clbp-en. one death occurred 11 days after last drug dose (duloxetine) due to cardiopulmonary 
 arrest (study clbp-eo). the investigator considered the event as not related to study drug or protocol 
 procedure. a total of 9 deaths (5 patients treated with duloxetine and 4 patients treated with placebo) 
 were reported in the controlled phases of the all other placebo-controlled analyses set. a total of 43 
 deaths were reported in the all duloxetine analyses set. the cause of death in these patients did not 
 form a meaningful pattern and did not suggest a particular effect on any specific body system or 
 evidence of systemic drug toxicity. 
 other serious adverse events 
 in the primary long-term analyses set, 4 (4.8%) patients experienced an sae including acute 
 tonsillitis, ostheoarthritis, syncope and tonsillitis, all of them were reported with the same frequency 
 (1; 1.2%).</p><p>the most frequently reported saes were myocardial infarction, asthma, non-cardiac chest

 analysis set, while one patient experienced suicidal ideation during the extension phase of study clbp-
 en. 
 hepatic analyses 
 the use of duloxetine in the chronic pain studies was associated with mean hepatic enzyme elevation 
 but not bilirubin elevation. there were 4 cases (0.55%) of alt values &gt;3x uln in duloxetine-treated 
 patients compared with 1 case (0.17%) in placebo-treated patients. two of these duloxetine-treated 
 cases (0.28%) also had alt values of &gt;5x uln and &gt;10x uln compared with no cases in the placebo-
 treated patients. given the small number of cases, there were no statistically significant differences 
 between the duloxetine and placebo treatment groups. 
 in addition to the evaluation of liver-related events in the overall duloxetine-treated population, the 
 subset of patients taking acetaminophen is of special interest, since acetaminophen is a known 
 hepatotoxin and would be a likely concomitant medication in patients with chronic pain conditions. 
 data from the analysis by acetaminofen use from all placebo-controlled studies did not show significant 
 differences in the incidence of alt elevations (categories &gt;3x uln, &gt;5x uln, 10x uln) between 
 patients with and without concomitant intake of acetaminophen, however the number of patients who 
 reported alt abnormalities was considerably higher in the duloxetine/acetaminophen subset 
 (n=33/1928; 2%) when compared to the placebo/acetaminophen subset (n=7/1466; 0.4%).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 morbidity associated with nsaids, this is an area of particular interest in the chronic pain population, 
 who will be receiving nsaids concomitantly with duloxetine. 
 the proportion of patients within the indication of oa/clbp experiencing at least 1 cardiovascular-

 analyses of cardiovascular-related teaes by nsaid use were performed to determine whether 
 concomitant use of duloxetine and nsaids increased the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. this 
 analysis was undertaken in patients from all placebo-controlled trials (i.e., with any indication including 
 oa/clbp). the following tables show the frequency of cardiovascular-related saes between treatment

 when analysing the non-nsaids users strata the frequency of cardiovascular adverse events was 
 slightly higher in the duloxetine arm (4.69%) as compared to placebo (4.23%). however according to 
 data on patients experiencing at least 1 teae no statistically significant interaction between nsaids 
 and duloxetine could be observed. albeit reassuring the lack of information on dose, duration, and 
 frequency of concomitant nsaid/ acetylsalicylic acid make the interpretation of these results difficult.

 in order to determine whether concomitant use of an nsaid with duloxetine would lead to a 
 synergistic effect on bleeding, the incidence of git-bleeding events in patients taking duloxetine with 
 concomitant nsaid / acetylsalicylic acid was compared with that of patients taking duloxetine without 
 concomitant nsaids / acetylsalicylic acid. the percentage of reports of any git-bleeding event was 
 numerically higher among both duloxetine and placebo-treated patients who used nsaids/

 programme. 16.4% of duloxetine patients discontinued due to ae, in the placebo arm discontinuation 
 rates were 6.1%. in the primary long-term analyses set, 55 of the 83 (66.3%) patients completed the 
 extension treatment phase. a brief summary of discontinuations due to the most common adverse 
 events has been provided, which shows that nausea was the most reported adverse event as the 
 reason for discontinuation. discontinuation rates, although lower for the chronic pain studies are 
 consistent with other duloxetine exposures. 
 overall, statistically significantly more duloxetine-treated patients experienced teaes compared with 
 placebo-treated patients. of the 839 patients who were treated with duloxetine in the placebo-
 controlled chronic pain studies 61.5% experienced any ae. nausea, dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, 
 diarrhoea, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue were reported at significantly greater level and by more 
 than 5% of patients. the profile of teaes of duloxetine in the chronic pain studies is similar to that 
 seen in all other placebo controlled studies, with the exception of the frequency of nausea. the 
 applicant argues that lower rate of nauseas seen in chronic pain studies could be explained by the fact 
 that the majority of the studies required a lead-in dose of 30-mg qd and patients were encouraged to 
 take duloxetine with food, which seems reasonable.</p><p>
 although the majority of measured aes were numerically higher in the duloxetine arm, no statistically 
 significant result was found but for sexual dysfunction events in clbp-eo study. most teaes were mild 
 or moderate in severity, with a higher reporting rate in the highest duloxetine dosage groups. when 
 stratified by severity all most common aes were more frequent in the duloxetine groups and the 
 differences were statistically significant. 
 no deaths were reported during the studies only one death occurred after completing the extension 
 phase of study clbp-en. the patient died due to cardiopulmonary arrest, however the event did not 
 seem to be attributed to the study drug. regarding other serious adverse events, 2.3% duloxetine-
 treated and 1.2% placebo treated patients in the primary placebo-controlled studies experienced 1 
 sae. one case of suicidal ideation was observed in the extension phase of clbp-en. overall the profile 
 of aes in the primary placebo-controlled analysis set was in line with the safety findings from previous 
 duloxetine studies. 
 as hepatic events were previously identified as important risks in other applications, the safety 
 assessment of this application was focused on the possible synergistic effect that the concomitant use 
 of duloxetine with acetaminophen could have. although no significant differences were observed in the 
 incidence of hepatic related aes between treatment groups by acetaminophen use, the increased risk 
 cannot be ignored as the number of cases of alt elevations identified in patients who were receiving 
 concomitantly duloxetine and acetaminophen was greater than in the placebo/acetaminophen arm. the 
 chmp concluded that monitoring of hepatic events should continue as it was unknown to what extent 
 the concomitant use of duloxetine and acetaminophen could increase the risk of hepatic events. 
 upper git (ugit) bleeding is considered an identified risk of duloxetine use. in the primary placebo 
 controlled analyses set at least 1 git-related bleeding was 0.23% for duloxetine vs. 0.15% for the 
 placebo. the most frequently reported git bleeding events with duloxetine were rectal haemorrhage 
 (0.10%) and haematochezia (0.04%). new information from clinical trials and postmarketing data has</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 42/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedbeen submitted by the mah in response to the chmp request to clarify the potential risk for ugit bleeding with concomitant use of duloxetine and nsaids. according to the mah, there has been no 
 evidence of an interaction of duloxetine and nsaids when combined on bleeding events. nevertheless, 
 the chmp did not consider reassuring these findings due to the intrinsic limitations of the source of the 
 information (e.g. retrospective health-claims database without confirming with medical records, and 
 controlling for confounding factors; a post-hoc review of the clinical trial database with limited 
 information on doses, exposures, and other covariates; spontaneous reporting). in the chmp’s opinion, 
 the association of ugit bleeding with concomitant use of ssris/snris and nsaids would represent a 
 safety concern for duloxetine in the treatment of chronic pain. 
 similarly cardiovascular events could be expected when duloxetine is administered concomitantly with 
 nsaids. due to the known mechanism of action of duloxetine the noradrenergic-related events would 
 be also expected to appear, particularly an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant 
 hypertension.</p><p>
 although no significant results were observed in the performed analyses stratified by nsaids, the 
 chmp felt that the risk of ugit bleeding and cardiovascular events could not be ruled out. a trend for 
 an increase in some git and cv aes was observed even in the studies supporting the current 
 indication. no firm conclusions could be drawn, as the number of patients and events was too limited. 
 however, the committee felt that from a mechanistic point of view, and based on the available 
 evidence, an increased risk for these aes could be expected following concomitant use of nsaids and 
 duloxetine. the lack of detailed information regarding nsaids dose, duration, and frequency of 
 concomitant use with duloxetine was considered to be an important unknown in this application. the 
 existence of studies that associate ugit bleeding with ssris/snris (venlafaxine) added to the 
 concern. 
 the chmp found the applicant’s proposal to withdraw the indication for duloxetine in add-on therapy to 
 nsaids/acetaminophen reassuring. it was felt that restriction of target population would address, at 
 least partially, some of the concerns providing appropriate warnings on how to minimise, or avoid risks 
 related to the concomitant use of duloxetine with analgesic therapies (including sporadic use). 
 nonetheless</p><p>the uncertainty regarding potential synergistic adverse effects of duloxetine and nsaids 
 could not be ignored in particular as it was felt that a concomitant use can hardly be avoided, even on 
 a non-regular basis.</p><p>
 the chmp noted that the information in the elderly population with the greatest burden of chronic 
 somatic pain, in particular the very elderly (&gt;75 years of age) who are likely to be most vulnerable to 
 any adverse events, was limited. it was felt that routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance activities as 
 proposed by the applicant would not be sufficient to adequately address the duloxetine safety profile in 
 this population.</p></section><section><header>conclusion on clinical safety</header><p>overall, it is acknowledged that the safety profile of duloxetine is well established and that from the evidence provided to support the current indication no unexpected aes have been identified. the 
 profile of observed aes was similar to that known for duloxetine in the authorised indications. 
 treatment with duloxetine is associated with several risks including suicidality, hypertension, cv 
 events, hepatotoxicity, and gi bleeding that require continuous monitoring. an important uncertainty 
 regarding the potential synergistic adverse effects of duloxetine and nsaids remained unsolved in 
 particular as it was felt that a concomitant use could not be avoided, even on a non-regular basis. in 
 addition, safety of duloxetine in the elderly population was considered as important missing

 overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment</header></section><section><header>benefits beneficial effects</header><p>the clinical program for duloxetine in the treatment of chronic low back pain (clbp) and osteoarthritic (oa) pain includes five clinical studies, three in clbp and two in oa. all the studies but one have 
 shown that duloxetine 60/120 mg qd produces a statistically significant decrease in pain intensity as 
 compared to placebo. this effect has been shown in the patient population with an overall basal pain of 
 6, which is deemed a moderate-severe pain. after 12-13 weeks of treatment, duloxetine reduced the 
 basal pain by more than 2 points, though differences when compared to placebo were smaller. either 
 the mrmm analysis or at least one of the two sensitive analyses carried out (locf &amp; bocf) were 
 statistically significant in favour of duloxetine for the main variable. moreover, when the subjects with 
 a 30 to 50% reduction in pain intensity as compared to baseline, were compared between placebo and 
 the experimental arms, a statistically significant effect could be observed for duloxetine in some 
 studies.</p><p>
 the results for the primary endpoints were generally supported by the analyses of the secondary 
 variables. with respect to health outcome measures the overall consistent effect was seen for the 36-
 item short form health survey bodily pain subscale.</p></section><section><header>uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</header><p>the clinical relevance of the observed effect, albeit statistically significant, is uncertain. in the overall population the results of the primary endpoint analysis showed, at best, a difference of 0.80 points 
 over an 11-point scale between duloxetine and placebo arms. in some studies, those differences were 
 of 0.40 or 0.60 points. the observed effect remained marginal from clinical point of view even if less 
 conservative methods of handling missing data (i.e. locf) were applied.</p><p>
 the population included in trials was not adequately defined. the concerns regarding the heterogeneity 
 of the studied population add further uncertainty as to what target population was intended for this 
 application.</p><p>
 the analysis of subgroups has shown that the favourable effect of duloxetine seen in clinical trials was 
 mainly determined by the results in the subset of patients for whom duloxetine was given in 
 ‘monotherapy’ (patients not taking nsaids regularly). based on the above-mentioned subgroup 
 analyses results in the monotherapy subset were statistically significant in only 2 out of 5 studies. 
 differences observed ranged from 0.55 to 0.67 points (studies clbp-gc and oa-fg respectively). 
 nonetheless, the usefulness of duloxetine monotherapy in the treatment of chronic pain remains 
 uncertain due to the limited benefit and the delay in reaching the therapeutic effect.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 44/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedmoreover, the lack of comparison to standard treatment makes it even more difficult to establish the potential value of duloxetine as monotherapy. the doubts on whether the marginal results are due to 
 duloxetine or whether they are a consequence of including a mild population remain unsolved. the lack 
 of active comparator cannot be resolved with the presented historical comparisons. apart from the 
 usual limitations of such comparisons there is uncertainty about the representativeness of the selection 
 of studies for analysis.</p><p>
 furthermore, data on rescue medication was not properly recorded for any of the studies, adding 
 uncertainties to the net contribution of duloxetine to the observed effect. of note, only partial 
 information can be found in the applicant’s responses, which does not cast any light on this subject. 
 the results supporting maintenance of effect were considered to have very limited value as a small 
 number of patients completed the open-label extension study and the effect was likely to be 
 overestimated adding to the uncertainty on the long-term efficacy. 
 the efficacy in the elderly, in particular the very elderly, was studied in a very limited number of 
 patients.</p></section><section><header>risks unfavourable effects</header><p>overall, statistically significantly more duloxetine-treated patients experienced teaes compared with placebo-treated patients. nausea, dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, diarrhoea, dizziness, somnolence 
 and fatigue were reported with a significantly greater frequency as compared to placebo and by more 
 than 5% of patients. most of aes tended to appeared early in duloxetine treatment and subside 
 quickly, whilst fatigue and dry mouth seemed to persist longer during treatment. 2.3% duloxetine-
 treated patients in the primary placebo-controlled studies experienced 1 sae. 
 duloxetine patients showed greater percentages of abnormal values of hepatic enzymes than placebo 
 patients. alt elevations returned to normal levels or were decreasing by the patient’s last visit, 
 regardless of whether they continued or discontinued study drug.</p><p>
 gastrointestinal tract bleeding was reported in placebo-controlled trials (all indications regardless of 
 nsaid use) more frequently in duloxetine groups than in placebo. the frequency of cardiovascular 
 adverse events was slightly higher in the duloxetine arm as compared to placebo irrespective of 
 nsaids use in placebo-controlled trials. 
 overall, the safety profile of duloxetine is well established and from the evidence provided to support 
 the current indication no unexpected aes have been identified. the profile of observed aes was similar 
 to that known for duloxetine in the authorised indications. treatment with duloxetine is associated with 
 several risks including suicidality, hypertension, cv events, hepatotoxicity, and gi bleeding that 
 require continuous monitoring.</p></section><section><header>uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</header><p>in the context of the current application, the potential effect of concomitant use of duloxetine with nsaids on cardiovascular events is of concern. nsaids have common and potentially severe adverse

 disease.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe potential risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding with concomitant use of ssris/snris and nsaids represents a safety concern highlighted also by the available literature data. 
 importantly, due to the fact that the use of nsaids can induce different forms of acute renal failure 
 (e.g. haemodynamically-mediated; acute interstitial nephritis often accompanied by a nephrotic 
 syndrome), the possibility of a synergic effect with the concomitant use of duloxetine and nsaids 
 cannot be ruled out. 
 the initially applied for broader indication does not allow to ignore the known and potential risks of the 
 add-on therapy. the restriction of target population would address, at least partially, some of the 
 concerns providing appropriate warnings on how to minimise, or avoid risks related to the concomitant 
 use of duloxetine with analgesic therapies (including sporadic use) were included. however, the 
 uncertainty regarding potential synergistic adverse effects of duloxetine and nsaids could not be 
 ignored in particular as it was felt that a concomitant use can hardly be avoided, even on a non-regular 
 basis. 
 safety of duloxetine in the elderly population with chronic pain remains uncertain due to 
 underrepresentation of this population in the studies.</p></section><section><header>balance importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>during the procedure the applicant decided to restrict the initially applied for indication ‘treatment of moderately severe chronic somatic pain’ to ‘treatment of chronic somatic pain (as established in 
 chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis) of at least moderate severity in patients not taking nsaids 
 regularly’. 
 albeit some concerns can be solved by means of this restriction in the indication, the main efficacy 
 concerns are still maintained.</p><p>
 the magnitude of the differences between placebo and duloxetine are of questionable clinical 
 relevance. the concerns related to the absence of comparator and the delay in reaching the 
 therapeutic effect undermine the potential value of duloxetine monotherapy in the treatment of chronic 
 pain conditions. the contribution of the rescue medication used during the studies remains unknown 
 adding further uncertainties to the relevance of the observed effect. additionally, if a monotherapy use 
 of duloxetine is considered, concerns arise regarding the representativeness of the target population in 
 the submitted clinical trials. patients taking nsaids for less than 15 days per month were defined as 
 “non users”, which questions to what extend this population represents truly a monotherapy use.</p><p>
 furthermore, to what extent the observed results might be extrapolated to the newly proposed target 
 population, i.e. patients intolerant, with contraindications for nsaids including potential bleeding or 
 cardiovascular risk when using nsaids remains uncertain.</p><p>
 the maintenance of effect was studied in a small number of patients in the open-label extension study 
 adding to the uncertainty on the long-term efficacy. moreover, the information on the duloxetine 
 efficacy in the elderly in chronic somatic pain is limited. 
 if a convincing effect could be demonstrated, the safety profile of duloxetine when used truly in 
 monotherapy would not be a limitation; however the uncertainty regarding potential synergistic 
 adverse effects of duloxetine and nsaids remained unsolved and it was felt that a concomitant use 
 would be expected. moreover, the limited safety information in the elderly with the greatest burden of 
 chronic somatic pain made uncertain the duloxetine benefit in this population.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 convincing and only in 3 out of 5 studies reached statistical significance. therefore, the clinical 
 significance of these finding is highly questionable. the difference between placebo and duloxetine 
 does not seem to be perceptible by patients. in addition, the small positive effect of duloxetine is 
 reduced in the presence of nsaids. no effect appears to be observed when these two therapies are 
 administered concomitantly. moreover, the absence of a concurrent comparator in the studies makes it 
 even more difficult to put the findings into perspective and to establish the potential benefit/risk of 
 duloxetine as an alternative to nsaids, which is the claimed restricted indication. 
 following the initially identified major concerns, the applicant has restricted the indication to the 
 subset of patients receiving duloxetine as monotherapy. in this regard, efficacy conclusions do not 
 change substantially, the observed effect is not deemed clinically relevant, and the lack of a concurrent 
 comparator does not allow putting findings into perspective. the unknown contribution of the rescue 
 medication to the overall effect adds further uncertainties to the efficacy assessment. in addition 
 concerns arise regarding the heterogeneous trial population, which makes it even more difficult to 
 ascertain whether these results can be extrapolated to the intended target population.</p><p>
 the maintenance of the effect has not been adequately demonstrated as very limited number of 
 patients was evaluated in the long-term extension study. in addition, the information on the duloxetine

 the safety in the elderly remains uncertain due to underrepresentation of this population in the 
 studies. there is also uncertainty regarding potential synergistic adverse effects of duloxetine and 
 nsaids in particular in light of the expected sporadic concomitant use. 
 although it is not the remit of the chmp to establish the place of a new drug in therapeutic 
 armamentarium, in the absence of an active comparator, particularly in the treatment of pain 
 conditions for which there are highly effective drugs, it is particularly difficult to conclude on the 
 benefit/risk of duloxetine as an alternative therapy to nsaids on the basis of the evidence provided.</p><p>

 the applicant’s proposal to modify the indication is reassuring and solves, at least partially, some 
 concerns regarding clinical safety as long as a true monotherapy indication is intended. nonetheless, 
 duloxetine-placebo differences in the subset of patients “not using nsaids regularly” do not change 
 the chmp view regarding the clinical relevance. in the absence of a concurrent comparator it is difficult 
 to interpret the relevance of the observed effect of duloxetine in the relief of chronic somatic pain as 
 an alternative to nsaids in monotherapy. the unknown contribution of the rescue medication to the 
 overall effect and doubts as to whether a true monotherapy setting was tested in clinical trials 
 supporting this application, add further uncertainties to the efficacy assessment.

 across all duloxetine studies, with the frequency of patients achieving response being statistically 
 significantly greater with duloxetine than placebo in 3 of the 4 positive studies including supportive

 both oa and clbp studies, statistically significantly more duloxetine patients (40.3% and 38.4%, 
 respectively) attained a clinically meaningful response compared with placebo patients (25.7%and

 (50% reduction in average pain) also experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in physical

 in an external expert report (figure 4). except where indicated, the response rates were calculated 
 using a bocf approach. the choice of the historical comparator was driven primarily by the availability 
 of data analysed using the bocf approach, though response rate data from tapentadol studies, only 
 analysed using locf methodology, were included due to recent approval of tapentadol in the eu.

 tapentadol is considered an important comparator for duloxetine by the mah for the following reasons: 
 a) it is recently approved for treatment of chronic pain in a number of eu countries and b) it has been 
 studied in the same disease states of oa, clbp, and dpnp. also, when considering the proposed target 
 chronic pain population for duloxetine, tapentadol is a newer drug of an established class of analgesic 
 medication that represents an alternative treatment option for such patients.</p><p>

 60 mg bid 1.1; lumiracoxib 100-400 mg 0.5-0.8; celecoxib 200 mg 0.5-0.7; tapentadol 100-250 mg 
 bid 0.3-0.7). this conclusion holds even in light of duloxetine’s treatment effect as assessed using the 
 bocf methodology: -0.63 for pooled oa studies. 
 in order to come to a formal comparison of duloxetine with a variety of existing treatments, the mah 
 applied a meta-analytical framework to combine the results of independent trials. in the case of oa, 
 the meta-analysis was based on the womac pain subscale, as this represents an identical validated 
 measure that has been used in recent clinical trials. in the case of clbp, normal values of the used 
 pain scales (vas, nrs, and bpi) were applied in order to be able to compare the studied treatment 
 alternatives. in order to limit potential bias in line with principles of good practice for standard meta-
 analysis (nice 2008a; emea 2001), a detailed review protocol was pre-specified. most included trials 
 had a quality rating of at least 5 (out of 7) indicating trials of sufficient quality for inclusion. with 
 regard to the meta-analysis of clbp trials, even though the number of randomised controlled trials of 
 similar duration and population in clbp is substantially smaller than in oa, duloxetine appears to be as 
 efficacious as alternative treatments (without correction for confounders). 
 in conclusion, while the magnitude of effect for duloxetine appears moderate, the meta-analyses 
 confirmed in the mah’s view that duloxetine’s analgesic effect was in line with the moderate group 
 mean differences observed with other analgesics widely acknowledged and used to manage chronic 
 pain.</p><p>
 furthermore, the mah has based its assessment of clinical relevance upon the consensus statement of 
 the initiative on methods, measurements, and pain assessment in clinical trials (immpact) an expert 
 group developing consensus reviews and recommendations for improving the design, execution and 
 interpretation of clinical trials of treatments for pain (immpact [www]). in order to place duloxetine’s</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 52/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedmagnitude of effect into perspective, a detailed assessment of duloxetine clinical data against each of these recommendations was provided with a summary of this review. in the mah’s view, on all 
 applicable immpact criteria, the magnitude of effect for duloxetine was consistently demonstrated as 
 clinically meaningful.</p></section><section><header>other efficacy-related issues</header><p>target population - use of subgroups the mah enrolled both nsaid users and non users into 4 of the 5 duloxetine chronic pain studies (the 5th study clpb-gc required all patients to wash out of all analgesics). the mah agrees with the 
 chmp’s view that chronic pain patients who are regular nsaid users and those who are not regular 
 nsaid users may represent different subpopulations. therefore, the randomisation was stratified by 
 this baseline characteristic, i.e. whether patients were or were not regularly taking a therapeutic dose 
 of nsaids, to pre-specify this subgroup analysis (although the power calculation was based on all 
 randomised patients).</p><p>
 regular use was defined as taking an nsaid/paracetamol for longer than 15 days over three 
 consecutive months prior to randomization.</p><p>conversely, patients using nsaids/paracetamol less 
 frequently (or not at all) were randomised as nsaid nonusers. 
 the above described approach to the clinical trial was considered appropriate by the mah for the 
 following reasons:</p><p>
 1) 
 the intention of the trials was to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in a setting that 
 best reflects clinical situations. it was not mah’s intention to study duloxetine specifically in the 
 population of patients for whom nsaids are contraindicated and who, consequently, would not take an 
 nsaid under any circumstance (although such patients were not excluded either).</p><p>
 2) 
 nsaids are the most widely used class of drugs worldwide. with regard to their use, patients 
 with chronic pain can be divided into two categories: a) those taking nsaids regularly (daily or almost 
 daily); and b) those who take them sporadically. the former group consists of patients who tolerate 
 nsaids well and who perceive treatment benefit. the latter group is made of a clinically different type 
 of patients including those who take nsaids only for a flare-up of their primary condition, for an 
 activity-induced pain exacerbation, or for an unrelated acute or intermittent painful condition. 
 alternatively, they may be less able to tolerate nsaids. 
 3) 
 it is important to recognize that the above two categories of patients are likely different 
 because of complex and not fully understood differences in the underlying mechanisms of their pain, 
 pharmacogenomic profiles, or other factors. consequently, it is scientifically justified to explore 
 potential differences in their response to an investigational analgesic. 
 as acknowledged by the chmp, the analgesic effect of duloxetine over placebo in all randomised 
 patients has been demonstrated by the analyses of mean reduction in average pain severity using both 
 the primary analysis method of mmrm (4 out of 5 studies positive), and the sensitivity analysis using</p><p>
 bocf methodology (3 out of 5 studies positive). the remaining studies are supportive because they 
 showed a numerically greater pain reduction with duloxetine treatment relative to placebo. since the 
 pivotal studies met the primary objective and there was a priori stratification on the basis of nsaid 
 use, the mah considered it appropriate to further analyse the data by nsaid use status (using the 
 bocf approach), even though the studies themselves were not powered to detect statistically 
 significant differences between subgroups.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 and clbp-en/gc/eo) - nsaid nonusers only.</p><p>
 as shown above (figure 6), despite the smaller sample size and subsequent loss of statistical power 
 with the subgroup analysis using bocf, nsaid nonusers experienced statistically significant greater 
 decrease in average pain with duloxetine compared with placebo in 2 of the 4 positive studies, with the 
 remaining studies being numerically consistent. further, the magnitude of difference among all studies 
 was similar (duloxetine-placebo difference range: -0.5 to -0.7) and, when pooling by disease state 
 (figure 7), the duloxetine-placebo differences were statistically significant. 
 non-inferiority margin and group mean versus individual response</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 54/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedduring the assessment the clinical relevance of duloxetine’s effect was questioned based on the duloxetine-placebo difference being smaller than published non-inferiority margins. in their grounds for 
 re-examination the mah underlines than in the case of the etoricoxib reference results (pallay et al. 
 2004) that study used flare design and imputed results using a time weighted average, both of which 
 were likely to inflate the drug -placebo difference (a point made by one of the experts contacted by the 
 mah, dr dougados). in mah’s view a fair comparison should include only the studies of similar design 
 and analytical approach. this point is considered further in the indirect comparison carried out by the 
 mah.</p><p>
 moreover, in support of a cautious use of thresholds to assess the clinical relevance of results observed 
 with duloxetine in oa and clbp the mah quotes opinions from experts in the field.</p><p>
 -</p><p>letter from dr maxime dougados, professor of rheumatology, rene descartes university, paris 
 france, the senior author of the tubach et al. 2005 paper,</p><p>
 -</p><p>letter from dr john farrar, department of biostatistics and epidemiology, center for clinical 
 epidemiology and biostatistics (cceb), medical center, the university of pennsylvania,</p><p>
 -</p><p>letter from dr robert h. dworkin, the chairman of the immpact group.</p><p>
 the experts quoted by the mah stated also that “the threshold published in this paper should not be 
 used for interpretation of data presented in terms of between group differences in mean changes of 
 continuous variables (e.g. vas or likert scale) [tubach et al. 2005]” and that a clinically meaningful 
 change from baseline to endpoint for an individual patient should not be used as the basis for 
 determining the threshold at which the magnitude of the drug-placebo difference becomes clinically 
 meaningful at a group level (dworkin). 
 lack of active comparator and historic comparisons the lack of an active comparator in the duloxetine chronic pain studies has been viewed by the chmp as a flaw that prevents an effective evaluation of the clinical relevance of duloxetine’s effect. however, 
 in the mah’s view the lack of active comparator in these studies arose out of valid scientific concerns 
 and there are scientifically valid approaches for assessing clinical relevance which are appropriate for 
 use with the duloxetine studies.</p><p>
 the placebo was selected as the sole comparator for all studies for several reasons, which in the mah’s 
 view justify placebo use alone: 
 1. 
 use of a nsaid as an active comparator would have resulted in the exclusion of patients with 
 established cv, gi, or renal disease consistent with the warnings and precautions contained within 
 nsaid labelling, even if the protocol mandated only short term use of nsaids.</p><p> 
 2. 
 administration of any non-selective nsaid would need to be associated with concomitant use 
 of a proton-pump inhibitor, which poses a significant challenge with respect to blinding any trial.</p><p>
 3. 
 use of a selective cox2 inhibitor was not viewed as acceptable since duloxetine studies were 
 initiated at the time of public disclosure of the vigor trial results, subsequent withdrawal of rofecoxib 
 from the market, and mounting concerns about safety of cox2 inhibitors as a class.</p><p>
 4. 
 use of any opioid as active comparator was not seen as an option. apart from the many 
 medical reasons for not using an opioid (such as narrow therapeutic index, abuse potential, and 
 diversion), the differences in adverse event profile and tolerability between duloxetine and any opioid 
 would likely lead to an unblinding of the study.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 55/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised5. while paracetamol may be used for the first line treatment of low back pain, such a 
 comparator would not be appropriate for a patient population with established clbp and a pain 
 severity of at least 4 on the bpi average pain scale.</p><p> 
 the mah has also considered the aspects highlighted in the reflection paper from the chmp (ema 
 /759784/2010) that need to be addressed if no direct comparison to active control is included in a 
 marketing authorisation application for a product. using these criteria the mah concluded that it was 
 reasonable in this case, to base the scientific conclusions on efficacy and safety from placebo-
 controlled studies alone.</p><p> 
 the historical comparisons provided to chmp comprised a meta-analysis of published studies in 
 osteoarthritis and clbp, a historical comparison of treatment effect for published studies using locf, 
 and a historical comparison of data available to the mah using bocf. the applicant fully acknowledged 
 that a direct comparison with an active drug would better answer questions on comparative efficacy, 
 but choice of an appropriate comparator was carefully considered and deemed not feasible. in the 
 mah’s view these duloxetine comparisons have been undertaken in a manner consistent with the eu 
 guidance for historical comparison. selection of studies used for historical comparisons was not based 
 on the conclusions of the studies, but rather based on their design. in order to minimise selection bias, 
 the inclusion and exclusion criteria for published literature were predefined before performing the 
 literature search. studies were included if they met the following criteria: placebo-controlled studies in 
 oa and clbp; 12-week duration; pain severity as primary; design and analysis similar, except that 
 some used flare design; study populations comparable. in addition to comparisons which included all 
 studies meeting these criteria, a further historical comparison was undertaken with all data available to 
 the mah where data from chronic pain studies were analysed using bocf. in the mah’s view while this 
 approach may be less valuable as the use of a direct comparator, such a careful historical comparison 
 provides useful insight into the relative efficacy of duloxetine and well established analgesics and hence 
 the clinical relevance of duloxetine. 
 rescue medication use</p><p>in accordance with the ethical principles of placebo-controlled clinical trials in chronic pain, episodic use of analgesics as rescue treatment was allowed in all studies in order to increase patient retention. 
 however, for all studies rescue medication use was restricted - episodic use was defined as &lt;3 
 consecutive days and &lt;20 days total during the 3-month treatment period. tramadol was the only 
 disallowed rescue analgesic due to the potential risk of serotonin syndrome.</p><p>

 reasonable to extrapolate to the other highly comparable studies, the mah concludes that the 
 duloxetine study results are fully interpretable and not confounded by use of rescue analgesics. 
 timing and onset of efficacy</p><p>in mah’s view the most informative approach to examine the earliest time to response was a 30% response analysis using average pain data collected from patient diaries, which was performed using 
 data from study hmgc (clbp), the study where concomitant use of nsaids was not allowed.</p><p> 
 the results from this analysis demonstrated that 15% of all randomised duloxetine-treated patients 
 responded (defined as at least 30% decrease from baseline average pain rating) by week 1 and 40% 
 had responded by week 3. there was a statistically significant difference in response rates versus 
 placebo starting at week 1 (8%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.011, 0.14). the results were 
 consistent with those observed in the already approved indication of diabetic peripheral neuropathic 
 pain (dpnp) (pritchett et al. 2007). 
 based on these data and good clinical practice, the mah proposed a recommendation in the smpc to 
 re-evaluate patients at 4 weeks post-duloxetine initiation to assess response status, and cautions that 
 “additional response after this time is unlikely”. in order to further strengthen this recommendation, 
 the statement</p><p>“consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment.” could be added to the 
 proposed smpc.</p></section><section><header>mah’s conclusions</header><p>three different approaches to the assessment of the clinical relevance of the therapeutic effects of duloxetine have shown that, a significant proportion of patients in the target population have 
 substantial benefit and the analgesic effect is consistent with that seen for other well established 
 chronic pain medications, comparing favourably with the newly approved opioid, tapentadol. in 
 addition, when assessed against a set of internationally recognised recommendations for what 
 constitutes a clinically meaningful response, duloxetine is judged well against all applicable criteria, in 
 particular in light of no general consensus as to what constitutes evidence of a clinically relevant 
 magnitude of treatment effect on a group mean level within chronic pain studies. 
 furthermore, in mah’s view the use of the subgroup of nsaid nonusers has been sufficiently justified; 
 adequate detail of rescue medication was collected; acceptable onset of meaningful effect taking into 
 account the chronicity of the disease was attained. in addition, there were scientific reasons for the 
 use of placebo at the time of the studies’ initiation and the program met the criteria for the use of 
 placebo as comparator described in the chmp reflection paper on this issue (ema/759784/2010).</p></section><section><header>chmp’s conclusions</header><p>the chmp acknowledges that the short-term efficacy in the target population of nsaids non-users (patients not using nsaids regularly) has been shown from a statistical significance perspective.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 57/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedhowever, the magnitude of the effect at a group level as well as at a responder rate level is small, and it is questionable whether it is clinically relevant. in the only study evaluating the effect of duloxetine 
 in a true monotherapy setting, study clbp-gc, the absolute differences over placebo in the average 
 pain intensity change from baseline was -0.55 on an 11-point scale (bocf). when considering the rate 
 of responders, differences over placebo were 7.1% for the 30% responder rate and 14.8% for the 
 50% responder rate.</p><p>
 it is uncertain how the magnitude of the observed effect as compared to placebo translates into clinical 
 relevance, particularly in the treatment of a chronic condition. in this light, the lack of an active control 
 is a limitation, since the intention of the mah would be to place duloxetine as an alternative to nsaids 
 or opioids. 
 the comparisons presented by the applicant with data from other pain medicines are only indirect, and 
 cannot obviate for the lack of a comparator. historical comparisons do not seem valid nor justified for 
 this common condition. without a direct comparison in head to head trials, it is difficult to put the 
 observed effect into clinical perspective.</p><p>
 the contribution of the background anti-inflammatory medication to the overall effect is unknown 
 which adds further uncertainties to the efficacy assessment. 
 moreover, the higher discontinuation rate observed in the duloxetine treatment arms could suggest 
 that the moderate treatment efficacy did not outweigh the burden of adverse events.</p><p>
 the clinical relevance of the modest effect shown has to be considered in light of the safety and 
 tolerability profile of duloxetine in the target population. various amendments to the definition, in the 
 indication, of the proposed target population were discussed during the procedure, but the chmp 
 considered them of doubtful clinical applicability. this is further discussed under grounds for refusal 
 number 3 and 5.</p></section><section><header>ground #2 the limited evidence provided to support the maintenance of the effect over time can hardly be taken as sufficient for a medicinal product intended for the treatment of a 
 chronic condition. 
 mah’s position</header><p>the extension phase of study clbp-en (hmen) was designed to assess the maintenance of duloxetine’s analgesic effect in clbp. study clbp-en (hmen), the maintenance-of-effect study with 
 the 41-week open-label extension phase after 13-week, placebo-controlled treatment phase, was 
 designed to be similar to the maintenance-of-effect study (hmem), the long term study provided in 
 support of the duloxetine dpnp submission. study clbp-en (hmen) was designed to be consistent with 
 chmp follow-up scientific advice (september 2006, emea/chmp/sawp/ 364064/2006) which stated 
 that the 12-week pivotal studies “should be complemented by 12 months’ data to exclude tolerance. it 
 was accepted previously that this 12 months’ data could be acquired in an open label extension”. in 
 mah’s view the extension period (up to 41 weeks after 13 weeks of placebo-controlled treatment) 
 better reflects the long-term treatment requirement for chronic pain, consistent with chmp scientific 
 advice (15 december 2005) for duration and sets a higher bar to demonstrate the maintenance of 
 effect. to the best of the mah’s knowledge of the literature relating to the management of clbp, study 
 clbp-en (hmen) represents the longest study in patients with clbp.</p><p>
 a margin of 1.5 was chosen to assess whether maintenance of effect was achieved after 12 months of 
 treatment. this margin was based on the following consideration: dpnp and clbp are degenerative 
 diseases, and, upon consultation, the clinical advisors suggested that a worsening of up to 1.5 points 
 during the maintenance period would still retain an improvement that is clinically meaningful</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 58/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised(compared with the pain that patients would feel if they had not taken treatment and the disease had progressed). to address the concern in the chmp that the locf approach potentially overestimates the 
 maintenance effect, a post-hoc non-inferiority analysis using the bocf method was performed to 
 construct a 97.5% ci based on the mean change from baseline to bocf endpoint. the analysis used 
 data from patients who met response criteria during the 13-week treatment phase of the study and 
 subsequently entered the extension phase (referred to as “duloxetine responders”). 
 using bocf methodology, the mean change in bpi average pain was 0.70, and the upper bound of the 
 one-sided 97.5% ci was -0.28, which was less than the prespecified margin of 1.5 points, and also 
 less than zero. this result, therefore, shows that duloxetine responders maintained response to 
 duloxetine throughout the extension phase. 
 additionally, a response rate analysis using the bocf approach (defined as at least 30% average pain 
 reduction from study baseline) was performed in which patients who discontinued the extension phase 
 were treated as non-responders regardless of the average pain rating collected during the extension 
 phase. for duloxetine responders (n=61), the bocf response rate at the end of a 41-week extension 
 phase was 63.9% (39 out of 61 responders), which indicated the majority of patients maintained the 
 pain reduction obtained during 13-week acute treatment.</p></section><section><header>mah’s conclusions</header><p>in study clbp-en (hmen), patients who remained on duloxetine for 9 months continued to improve throughout the study. both bocf and locf analysis found that the majority of acute phase duloxetine 
 responders still met response criteria at the end of the 41-week extension phase and the upper bound 
 of the one-sided 97.5% ci was less than 0, indicating a further significant pain reduction from the end 
 of acute phase during extension treatment. in addition, the sample size of 61 patients provides more 
 than 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority, it can be concluded that duloxetine’s effect is 
 maintained for up to 1 year. these data are supported by the long-term efficacy results in the 181 
 duloxetine-treated patients (all randomised patients) entering the extension phase. these patients, on 
 average, experienced a continuous pain reduction during the entire 54 week extended-treatment 
 period, comparable to that seen for dpnp.</p></section><section><header>chmp’s conclusions</header><p>the chmp maintained its initial opinion that the results supporting the maintenance of effect have limited value due to the small number of patients that completed the open label extension.</p><p>
 again, comparative data would undoubtedly have been preferable to substantiate the clinical relevance 
 of the effect in this chronic condition, however the current analysis provides some evidence that 
 patients are at least not deteriorating when using duloxetine.</p><p>
 it is difficult to see, however, how an effect can be maintained if it has not been robustly demonstrated 
 in the first place. 
 it was discussed at the oral explanation whether this concern could be resolved with an smpc 
 recommendation to re-evaluate and stop treatment in case of non-response after 4 weeks. in the 
 chmp opinion, it will not be easy to attribute worsening/ non-response/ lack of effect to an episodic 
 increase in pain due to the condition or lack of efficacy or both. the incorrect interpretation could be 
 that, in absence of duloxetine, the pain would have even been worse and the probable outcome would 
 be to use a concomitant nsaid, an incorrect recommendation.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 59/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe chmp noted that the mah proposed to commit to providing additional data on the maintenance of effect post-authorisation, but it was considered that this information should be part of the benefit/risk 
 evaluation.</p></section><section><header>ground #3 safety has not been sufficiently established in the population specified in the indication. 
 mah’s position</header><p>the safety profile of duloxetine has been well-characterised in more than 31,000 patients participating in clinical trials and more than 42 million patient exposures in postmarketing experience worldwide. 
 moreover, the product is already indicated in a pain condition, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain 
 (dpnp), which involves the use of duloxetine in an aged and vulnerable population, who will be taking 
 a significant number of concomitant medications.</p><p> 
 risk with concomitant nsaid use the mah performed clinical trial analysis focusing on the incidence of serious aes and treatment emergent adverse events (teae), specifically cv and gi bleeding events, in two groups of patients 
 (with and without concomitant use of nsaids or paracetamol) in two datasets. the two datasets used 
 were: chronic pain studies, excluding study clbp-gc (hmgc) and all placebo-controlled duloxetine 
 studies (that is patients from all studied indications: mdd, gad, dpnp, sui/lutd, fibromyalgia and 
 chronic pain). 
 when assessing the frequency of saes in the chronic pain studies (excluding clbp-gc (hmgc)), no 
 significant treatment-by-nsaid use interactions were observed for patients experiencing at least 1 sae 
 or for any individual sae (table 24). similarly, the overall frequency of treatment emergent adverse 
 events (teaes) in the chronic pain studies (excluding study clbp-gc (hmgc)) was comparable 
 between duloxetine nsaid users and nonusers, and no statistically significant treatment-by-nsaid use 
 interaction was found. overall, gi bleeding-related teaes were reported by duloxetine-treated patients 
 in the chronic pain studies in 1/377 (0.35%) in duloxetine only and in 0/264 (0.0%) in duloxetine plus 
 nsaids. these results are similar to data from all placebo-controlled studies combined, where gi 
 bleeding events were uncommon. no statistically significant treatment-by-nsaid interactions were 
 found for any individual gi-related bleeding event (table 24). 
 with respect to cv-related events in the chronic pain studies (excluding clbp-gc (hmgc)), though no 
 statistically significant treatment-by-nsaid use (p-value 0.251) was found for patients experiencing at 
 least 1 event, the percentage of duloxetine-treated patients experiencing at least 1 cardiovascular-
 related teae was greater among nsaids users than nsaid nonusers (driven by reports of palpitations 
 -duloxetine plus nsaids 2.3%, placebo plus nsaids 0.0%; duloxetine monotherapy 0.3%, placebo 
 monotherapy 0.7%). the clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. in the all placebo-
 controlled studies, however, there was little difference between the reporting rates of palpitations in 
 duloxetine-treated patients with nsaid (1.9%) than without (1.6%). for all cv-related events, this 
 imbalance between nsaid users and nonusers was not observed in all placebo-controlled studies, 
 where a larger sample size analysis resulted in a similar percentage of patients experiencing at least 1 
 cardiovascular-related teae between treatment groups with no nsaid use (duloxetine 3.9%, placebo 
 3.2%; p=.026) and with concomitant nsaids use (duloxetine 4.7%, placebo 4.2%; p=.493) (table 
 24).

 * nsaid use in the all pbo-studies was defined as any report of an nsaid; nsaid use in the chronic pain studies 
 (excluding hmgc) was defined based on stratification factor (i.e. - therapeutic nsaid use vs. sporadic). 
 additionally, the mah presented analyses comparing patients with previously reported gi bleeding or cardiovascular-related conditions (referred to as “vulnerable patients”) with patients with no reported 
 prior history, using both clinical trial data and postmarketing data. the clinical trial dataset included all 
 placebo-controlled studies (up to 3 months duloxetine exposure) and all longer-term duloxetine studies 
 (studies with at least 6 months of exposure; placebo group was not inluded). in all placebo-controlled 
 studies, there were no statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions for cv events or gi-
 bleeding events in all randomised patients (nsaids user and non nsaids user combined). these 
 results, however, need to be viewed with caution considering the relatively small numbers in the 
 “vulnerable patient” groups (n=552 in cv group; n=1364 in gi-bleeding group). in longer-term 
 studies, when compared with “not vulnerable” patients, duloxetine-treated “vulnerable” patients in the 
 all randomised patient population and the nsaid nonusers only population experienced a higher 
 frequency of all cv events combined; however, in light of the placebo-controlled data above where the 
 treatment by subgroup interaction was not statistically significant, the mah attributed this finding to 
 the intrinsic characteristics of the patient population. the rates for cardiovascular events (including 
 myocardial infarction [mi] and stroke) in the longer-term studies were consistent with incidence rates 
 of cardiovascular outcomes seen in epidemiological studies cited by the mah (steg et al 2007). a 
 numerical trend was seen in terms of in increased incidence in gi bleeding events in duloxetine-treated 
 “vulnerable patients” in placebo-controlled trials; however no increase in gi-bleeding events in the 
 longer-term was seen with respect to frequency of events observed during short-term treatment. any 
 gi-bleeding in “vulnerable patients” treated long term with duloxetine did not worsen with concomitant 
 nsaid use. 
 a higher discontinuation due to an ae was observed with duloxetine than placebo, the duloxetine-
 placebo difference for discontinuation due to an ae in “non-vulnerable patients” was statistically 
 significantly greater than the duloxetine-placebo difference in the “vulnerable patients” (p=.001). this 
 finding indicates that “vulnerable patients” were not more likely to discontinue due to an ae than “non-
 vulnerable” patients. the mah proposed that these areas of risk assessment (cv related and gi 
 bleeding related events) will continue to be closely monitored as described in the risk management 
 plan (rmp), including routine surveillance, active surveillance of a health claims database twice a year,</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 safety profile of duloxetine vs. opioids the mah also presented the indirect comparison of the safety profile of duloxetine with available information for opioids through smpc and literature data comparisons and pharmacovigilance activities 
 for duloxetine. in mah’s view the important identified and potential risks of duloxetine are well 
 characterised, do not have a significant impact on the healthcare burden, and can be managed without 
 needing additional risk minimisation requirements (beyond labelling). all the identified and potential 
 duloxetine risks are described appropriately in the smpc, enabling prescribers to understand the 
 benefit risk balance when prescribing duloxetine across all indications. on the contrary, according to 
 the mah opioids carry a disproportionate risk of abuse, dependence and addiction, an increased risk of 
 fatalities and serious public health implications. in addition to these issues, there are several other 
 risks related to opioids use, namely the risks of fractures, opioid induced endocrine dysfunction and 
 immunosuppression.</p></section><section><header>mah’s conclusions</header><p>duloxetine has well characterised, acceptable safety profile as a treatment option for patients with chronic pain who are not taking nsaids regularly (the targeted population). moreover, duloxetine has 
 more favourable safety profile in comparison to opioids, the most likely alternative medication for this 
 population.</p></section><section><header>chmp’s conclusions</header><p>uncertainties remain in the short and long term safety profile of duloxetine in the target population. gastrointestinal (gi) and cardiovascular (cv) side effects are known for duloxetine, and are expected 
 to be particularly relevant for a population for which nsaids use is not indicated. 
 the definition of nsaid non users as presented in the clinical trials is vague (patients using nsaids for 
 less than 15 days) and covers a broad population, including patients for which nsaids treatment was 
 not appropriate or contraindicated. in addition, nsaids are available as otc medication and it will be 
 impossible, in real life, to prevent patients from using them when considered needed, either sporadic 
 or on a regular basis. in practice, on demand nsaids will be taken potentially increasing the risk of 
 cv, gi and hepatic adverse events.</p><p>
 the translation of the definition “use of nsaids for less than &lt; 15 days” into an appropriate indication, 
 either “patients not taking nsaids regularly” or “where the prolonged use of nsaids is not appropriate 
 or contraindicated”, is therefore considered by chmp of doubtful clinical applicability and does not 
 solve the concerns.</p></section><section><header>ground #4 efficacy and safety have not been adequately established in the elderly. mah’s position</header><p>efficacy in the elderly duloxetine efficacy in the elderly (≥65 yrs) and very elderly (≥75 yrs), although limited in terms of available data, was assessed using the bpi-average pain data (the mean change from baseline to

 safety in the elderly exposure 
 as of april 2010, 3.4% of the 11,305 duloxetine-treated patients in the integrated placebo-controlled duloxetine studies were 75 years of age or older and 17% were at least 65 years of age. for the 5 
 chronic pain studies, 6.7% of the 839 patients were at least 75 years of age and 28% were at least 65 
 years of age. when considering postmarketing experience, it is estimated that of all patients exposed 
 to duloxetine, 17% were age 65 and older and 5.8% were over the age of 75 (as of 31 july 2011).</p><p>
 considering an estimated world-wide exposure of approximately 42.9 million patients for the same 
 period, approximately 7.4 million patients aged 65 and older and 2.5 million patients over the age of 
 75 have been exposed to duloxetine. for the purpose of statistical analysis the data were divided in 3 
 age groups: 18 years up to 65 years (18 to &lt;65 years); 65 up to 75 years, (65 to &lt;75 years), and 
 patients 75 or older (
 ≥75 years). serious adverse events by age no deaths were reported in the chronic pain studies, including the long term extension phase of study clbp-en (hmen). one death occurred in an 82-year-old female 11 days after last drug dose 
 (duloxetine) due to cardiopulmonary arrest (study clbp-eo/hmeo). the investigator considered the 
 event as not related to study drug or protocol procedure.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 63/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedfor all other placebo-controlled studies, excluding chronic pain (oa/clbp) studies, 9 deaths (5 patients treated with duloxetine and 4 patients treated with placebo) were reported; three of the deaths 
 occurred in patients aged 
 ≥65 years old, and 2 were in duloxetine-treated patients: one in 70 yr female hospitalised after 50 days of duloxetine treatment due to a haemothorax and 2 rib fractures 15 days 
 earlier. in the opinion of the investigator the events of cerebrovascular accident and haemothorax 
 were not related to the study drug or to the protocol procedures. another death occurred in 77 yr 
 female with a history of av block and diclofenac treatment hospitalised with a myocardial infarction 
 after 38 days of duloxetine treatment. in the investigator&apos;s opinion, there was no reasonable causal 
 relationship between the rupture of descending aortic aneurysm and myocardial infarction and study 
 medication. 
 with respect to saes in all placebo-controlled studies, a significant treatment-by-strata interaction (the 
 duloxetine/placebo difference across the age strata) was observed for the frequency of patients 
 experiencing at least 1 saes, which appears to be driven by the 
 ≥75 year old age group where more placebo patients (4.6%) experienced an sae compared with duloxetine-treated patients (2.0%). 
 further, the 8 duloxetine-treated patients aged 
 ≥75 years old experienced 10 saes (myocardial infarction, nausea, concussion, road traffic accident, acute myocardial infarction, wrist fracture, 
 abdominal mass, ankle fracture, aortic aneurysm rupture, and atrioventricular block complete) did not 
 represent an unusual pattern considering comorbid health events typical of this age group. in the 
 chronic pain studies, no significant treatment-by-strata interaction was observed and the frequency of 
 events within the very elderly groups (
 ≥75 years old) were similar between treatment groups.</p><p>adverse events leading to discontinuation by age with respect to discontinuations due to adverse events, no significant treatment-by-strata interactions, with the exception of nausea, were observed in the pooled chronic pain studies or the all placebo-
 controlled studies.</p><p>
 the reporting rate for nausea in all placebo-controlled studies was similar in the 3 duloxetine-treated 
 age subgroups (2.9%, 3.5%, 3.3%) and was higher than in placebo group (0.4%, 0.6%, 1.6%); the 
 difference was not significant (p=0.086).</p><p> 
 treatment-emergent adverse events by age/nsaid use in all placebo-controlled studies, the overall percentages of duloxetine-treated patients reporting a teae in each age group were similar: 74% of patients &lt;65 years, 67% of patients 
 ≥65 to &lt;75 years, and 67% of patients 
 ≥75 years. of the placebo-treated patients 47% reported teaes in the in ≥75 years subgroup, 59% of patients &lt;65 years, and 55% in the 
 ≥65 to &lt;75 years subgroup. this observation was not statistically significant (p=0.064). these data were similar to data from the pooled 
 chronic pain studies and there were no significant treatment-by-strata interactions in this data set. for 
 individual events in all placebo-controlled studies, the most common events for the 
 ≥75 years age subgroup (that is, a frequency 
 ≥5% in the duloxetine treatment group and reported significantly more frequently with duloxetine than with placebo) included: constipation, fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, 
 headache, somnolence, diarrhoea, falls and insomnia. the profile of teaes in the 
 ≥75 years age group was similar to the known teae profile of duloxetine (as listed in smpc). 
 in all placebo-controlled studies and the pooled chronic pain studies, there was no significant evidence 
 that duloxetine-treated patients aged 75 years and older were at increased risk for sustained blood 
 pressure elevations compared with patients in other age groups, as no significant treatment-by-strata 
 interactions were observed.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorisedwhen stratified by nsaids use, the teae profile of duloxetine monotherapy in elderly patients was similar to that observed for duloxetine plus nsaids in all placebo-controlled studies, with the possible 
 exception of hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>
 in longer-term duloxetine studies duloxetine-treated patients &lt;75 years of age experienced a 
 statistically significantly greater frequency (416.8 % patient years) of teaes than the very elderly 
 (335.9 % patient years; p=.011). patients &lt;65 years of age also experienced a greater frequency 
 (423.42 % patient years) of teaes than the elderly (364.6 % patient years), but the difference was 
 not statistically significant (p=0.208). with respect to discontinuations due to an adverse event, a 
 similar pattern was observed in both &gt;=65 and &gt;=75 age groups, namely, that both groups 
 discontinued more frequently due to an adverse event (&gt;=65 years old: 24.37 % patient year; &gt;=75 
 years old: 28.69 % patient year) than the &lt;65 (18.41 % patient year, p&lt;.001) years and &lt;75 years 
 groups (18.99 % patient year; p=.004), respectively. the frequency of dcaes in &gt;=75 patients was 
 numerically higher than that in &gt;=65 age group. the frequency of discontinuations was higher in 
 nsaid nonusers subgroup irrespective of age group, suggesting that concomitant nsaid use did not 
 lead to a higher rate of discontinuations compared with nsaid nonuser. event frequency decreased 
 over time. 
 comparison between chronic pain (oa/clbp) and dpnp clinical trial data another patient population that has been studied by the mah are patients with dpnp. in mah’s view data in the dpnp population are relevant to the data in the chronic pain population because the 2 
 patient groups are similar with respect to demographic characteristics, comorbid illnesses and 
 concomitant medication use. moreover, the dpnp studies provide controlled data for longer-term 
 treatment of up to 15 months with duloxetine (580 patients were treated with duloxetine 120 mg per 
 day, and 287 patients received routine care). in summary, a significantly greater percentage of patient 
 in the control group (routine care) experienced one or more saes compared with duloxetine-treated 
 patients in those studies. in addition data demonstrate that dpnp patients treated for long term with 
 duloxetine did not have more cardiovascular saes compared with dpnp patients receiving routine care. 
 analyses of postmarketing data by age from postmarketing data it has been observed over time that, with the exception of hyponatraemia, the spontaneous adverse event profile of elderly patients 65 years and older was similar to younger 
 patients. based on a review of spontaneous cases presented in the duloxetine psur 9, the company 
 core data sheet (ccds) was updated to give more detail on hyponatraemia in the special warnings 
 and special precautions for use section, and the smpc was updated accordingly. ischaemic cv and gi 
 bleeding events were very rarely reported (&lt;0.01%) in all age groups. the reporting rates of these 
 events increased with increasing age, but were not inconsistent with the known epidemiology of these

 elderly population. with respect to the safety profile in the elderly, there is an extensive duloxetine

 medicinal product no longer authorisedimportant safety signals were identified for duloxetine-treated patients ≥75 years of age in the chronic pain studies compared with all studies. data from all placebo-controlled duloxetine studies, indicated 
 that patients 
 ≥75 years of age maybe at higher risk for reporting ≥1 teaes, specifically fatigue, and falls; these events are recorded in the current smpc. patients in this age group do not otherwise seem 
 to be at higher risk, for example, for adverse events leading to death, discontinuation from treatment, 
 saes or sustained blood pressure elevation.</p><p>although the data from the chronic pain studies 
 constitutes a smaller analyses set, the data are consistent with the findings from all placebo-controlled, 
 duloxetine studies. postmarketing data indicate that, with the exception of hyponatremia, the ae 
 profile for elderly patients (65 years and older) is similar to younger patients. analyses of spontaneous 
 postmarketing adverse event reports showed that ischaemic cv events and gi bleeding events had 
 higher reporting rates in the elderly and that proportionally more elderly patients in the mah’s safety 
 database reported concomitant use of nsaids when compared with younger adults which is expected 
 considering the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and the known patterns of use of nsaids by 
 age. with respect to risks in combination with nsaid use, no synergistic effect between duloxetine and 
 nsaids were observed in elderly patients in clinical trials. additional pharmacovigilance activities 
 include the addition to the smpc of a statement noting the limited data in the very elderly and an 
 enhanced twice yearly retrospective analysis of relevant events (gi-bleeding, cardiovascular events) in 
 the elderly compared with the non-elderly patients. in summary, therefore, elderly patients do benefit 
 from treatment with duloxetine with a magnitude similar to non-elderly patients and the risks

 &gt;75 years of age and 28% were &gt;65 years of age. the only analysis provided in support of duloxetine 
 efficacy in the elderly was the comparison of an average pain and 50% response rates in the subgroup 
 nsaid nonusers &lt;65 and &gt;65. albeit this analysis showed no difference in the treatment effects

 medicinal product no longer authoriseduncontrolled pain is a significant public health problem and it is expected that its impact will grow dramatically as the population ages and people live longer with chronic pain. currently, 
 pharmacological treatment options for chronic pain in eu primarily include non-steroidal anti-
 inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and opioids. approximately 50% of patients with chronic pain are 
 prescribed treatment other than an nsaid, e.g. an opioid, the predominant alternative therapy, 
 followed by numerous adjuvant medication such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants 
 (breivik et al 2006). the number of patients on extended opioid treatment for chronic pain has 
 increased about 10-fold over 15 years within various eu countries and other regions. this increasing 
 trend has serious public health implications, leading to significant increases in prescription opioid 
 addiction and unintentional overdose-related mortality (office for national statistics, 2011; okie et al 
 2010; gomes et al 2011). a recent survey of eu patients has highlighted the unmet medical need in 
 treating chronic pain, with nearly half of patients being unsatisfied with their prescription medication 
 and nearly a quarter not taking any medications at all (dassa 2008). therefore, alternative treatment 
 options to opioids with an acceptable benefit risk profile are critically needed for patients with chronic 
 pain who are not taking nsaids regularly (langley 2011). 
 beneficial effects of duloxetine in the proposed target population the duloxetine-placebo difference, derived from the group mean change from baseline in bpi-average pain change using the bocf method, was -0.67 and -0.60 in the oa studies and -0.55 -0.54, -0.62, 
 and 0.20 in the clbp studies. the magnitude of effect of duloxetine, as assessed using bocf 
 methodology, was similar to a number of other analgesics including the recently approved opioid, 
 tapentadol, where the drug-placebo difference was -0.3 for oa studies and -0.6 for clbp studies. 
 moreover, as assessed in the duloxetine trials, using the bocf methodology, the duloxetine-placebo 
 difference of 50% response rate was 15% in pooled oa studies and 13% in pooled clbp studies. this 
 difference between treatment groups was statistically significant for the pooled oa (p=.008) and clbp 
 (p=&lt;.001) studies. this result represents a significant proportion of patients with chronic pain of, on 
 average 7 years duration, achieving a substantial improvement in their pain over a 3 months 
 treatment period and starting in some patients at one week from initiation of treatment. importantly, 
 these clinically significant improvements in pain severity were paralleled by substantial improvements 
 in physical function. these rates were comparable to those seen in other commonly used analgesics 
 (ranging from 10-21%), including the recently approved analgesic tapentadol (4% and 8% in oa and 
 clbp studies). 
 the mah acknowledges the lack of an active control in the duloxetine studies and the legitimate 
 concerns that chmp has raised in that regard. there were, however, several valid scientific concerns at 
 the time of study design which lead to the conclusion that placebo alone should be used. another 
 important concern raised by the chmp is the use of rescue medication in the chronic pain studies. 
 results from study clbp-gc (hmgc) demonstrated that the episodic use of rescue medication did not 
 confound the efficacy in nsaid nonusers, where responders and nonresponders reported comparable 
 frequency of rescue medication use (30-40%). chmp has raised the time of onset as a concern, 
 however, given that duloxetine is not for use in acute pain or as a rescue treatment in chronic pain, 
 the time to onset would still be clinically meaningful for patients who suffer from chronic pain for many 
 years. finally, chmp raised an uncertainty regarding maintenance of effect. the design of the long 
 term study (uncontrolled for 12 months) meets the requirements specified at the time of scientific 
 advice and represents a similar, but enhanced design, over the maintenance dpnp study. by applying 
 the bocf method to the analyses of maintenance of effect the conclusion remained the same – the 
 majority of duloxetine responders maintained the clinically relevant response achieved during acute 
 treatment for up to 1 year in this adequately powered study comparable with results for dpnp.

 medicinal product no longer authorisedthe safety profile of duloxetine has been well-characterised in more than 31,000 patients participating in clinical trials and more than 42 million patient exposures in postmarketing experience worldwide. a 
 significant amount is known about the risks associated with use of duloxetine and these are described 
 in the smpc and package leaflet. in summary, duloxetine has an acceptable safety profile as a 
 treatment option for patients with chronic pain who are not taking nsaids regularly, the safety profile 
 of duloxetine seems more favourable in comparison to opioids. 
 the analyses of vulnerable patients within the duloxetine clinical trials demonstrated that there was no 
 significant treatment-by-subgroup effect between patients with or without risk factors for cv and gi 
 bleeding. overall, these results, along with the longer-term clinical trial data, indicated that when 
 treating with duloxetine, there were no significantly increased risks for cv events or gi-bleeding 
 events in “vulnerable” patients compared with patients without risk factors. the safety and tolerability 
 data from chronic pain studies are consistent with those from other indications. the combined safety 
 database for duloxetine (all studied disease states) includes 1883 elderly patients (&gt;=65 years of age) 
 in clinical trials and 7.4 million elderly patients with postmarketing exposure. with the exception of 
 falls and hyponatremia, elderly patients with duloxetine exposures have not reported adverse events at 
 a higher rate than younger patients. data presented also support the conclusion that elderly patients 
 who take nsaids in combination with duloxetine have a similar risk profile as elderly patients who take 
 duloxetine alone. given the more limited data available in duloxetine chronic pain studies in the very 
 elderly (&gt;=75 yrs), this information will be reflected in the smpc, and the mah will continue to closely 
 monitor this group during postmarketing surveillance. this population will also be listed under the 
 “missing information” section of the rmp along with associated pv activities that include a semi-annual 
 retrospective cohort analysis of an insurance claims database assessing the targeted safety topics of 
 hepatic eventscardiovascular events, hypertension, and gi bleeding events stratified by age (rmp 9). 
 benefit-risk balance based on the demonstrated unmet medical need, alternative treatment options to opioids with an acceptable benefit/risk profile are needed to treat patients with chronic pain who are not taking 
 nsaids regularly. duloxetine has demonstrated a clinically relevant analgesic effect, as shown by 
 statistically significant response compared with placebo (that is at least equivalent to that</p><p>seen with 
 tapentadol and other opioids), maintenance of response in clbp patients and, in those seeing pain 
 reduction, a parallel improvement in physical functioning.</p><p>based on the benefit-risk summary provided 
 above, and in conjunction with less burdensome and well-established risk management for duloxetine 
 compared with opioids, the mah considers that the overall benefit-risk profile of duloxetine in patients 
 with chronic somatic pain is favourable for patients not taking nsaids regularly, and that a specific 
 targeted population exists who currently have very limited safe and effective treatment alternatives.</p></section><section><header>chmp’s conclusions</header><p>the therapeutic indication initially considered by the chmp during the re-examination procedure was: ‘treatment of chronic somatic pain (as established in chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis) of at 
 least moderate severity in patients not taking nsaids regularly’. 
 the indication was modified further during the re-examination procedure to reflect the submitted data 
 more appropriately and in an effort to further explore the target population, where efficacy could be 
 considered as demonstrated and where the benefit risk ratio could be considered as positive. 
 the final indication proposed by the mah was: ‘treatment of chronic low back pain or chronic 
 osteoarthritic pain of at least moderate severity in patients for whom the prolonged use of nsaids is 
 not appropriate or is contraindicated’.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 68/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedin the chmp’s view the benefit risk of duloxetine in the final indication applied for was considered unfavourable. the chmp remained of the opinion that the clinical relevance of the observed short term 
 effect of duloxetine in chronic low back pain and chronic osteoarthritic pain was questionable. several 
 factors including the absence of an active comparator, the limited long term evidence, the contribution 
 of the background analgesic treatment and the discontinuation rate in duloxetine treatment arms made 
 it difficult to interpret the clinical relevance of the effect. 
 in the chmp’s view the concerns about the safety of the product in the target population where ‘the 
 prolonged use of nsaids is not appropriate or contraindicated’ were not alleviated and would not be 
 mitigated with the proposed pharmacovigilance and risk management measures.</p><p>
 the chmp acknowledged the argument provided by the mah for the unmet medical need in chronic 
 pain treatment. however in light of the evidence provided, the difficulties to identify a priori patients 
 who would benefit from the treatment and the safety concerns surrounding the potential concomitant 
 use of nsaids, the chmp considered that the unmet medical need does not constitute sufficient 
 grounds in itself to support the use of duloxetine in chronic low back pain and chronic osteoarthritic 
 pain.</p></section><section><header>ad hoc expert group meeting conclusions</header><p>following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the chmp convened an ad hoc expert group to provide experts’ views on the chmp questions in relation to the application for the 
 variation, taking into account the applicant´s response to the grounds for refusal. 
 the conclusions from the ad hoc expert group meeting were the following: 
 q1. has the efficacy of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain of at least moderate severity been 
 convincingly demonstrated (for monotherapy and/or add-on therapy)? do you consider the differences 
 to placebo to be clinically relevant? has the efficacy been documented in elderly patients? 
 1. the efficacy has been studied and shown for pain in oa and clbp of moderate severity and only in monotherapy. the improvement in 50% responder rate is considered more clinically meaningful than 
 mean reduction in numeric rating scales (nrs). 
 the difference to placebo with nnt of 7 for oa and 8 for clbp may be considered as clinically relevant 
 in light of limited treatment options. in particular in oa the nnt of 7 (1 in 7 patients respond well) 
 could suggest a possibility of delaying surgical treatment, i.e. joint replacement surgery. when looking 
 at clbp, the nnt result of 8, it is difficult to define the clinical relevance as clearly as in oa.</p><p> 
 there is limited data on efficacy in the elderly. presenting data only on the lack of significant difference 
 between patients &gt;65 y and &lt;65 years is not enough, since the subgroup analysis showed a significant 
 difference between duloxetine and placebo in patients &gt;65 in one out of two studies in oa. in the 
 studies on clbp 55 years was used as a cut off and no statistical analysis of duloxetine vs. placebo has 
 been presented with cut-off of 65 in those studies.</p><p> 
 q2. has the maintenance of effect of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain of at least moderate severity been adequately documented? 
 2. one open trial in clbp in 117 patients provided convincing indication of maintenance of effect. the data on maintenance were considered limited but acceptable to the group. more data on the functional 
 improvement should be required post-approval to further document the maintenance of a clinically 
 relevant effect.</p><p>
 experts noted that the maintenance of effect was not studied in the oa pain.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/285264/2012</p><p>page 69/75</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorisedq3. what are the experts’ expectations in terms of maintenance of effect and long term data in this chronic condition (the expert group should discuss also within this context the potential contribution of 
 the use of rescue medication)? 
 the experts agreed that the design of the study (open label extension) was appropriate as it is not reasonable to ask for a placebo long term study.</p><p>
 the experts concluded that the appropriate target population should be patients who do not use 
 nsaids/cox-inhibitors continuously therefore the experts found it difficult to determine the extent of 
 the contribution of rescue medication.</p><p>
 q4. what is your view on the lack of an active comparator in the pivotal clinical trials? to what extent does it hamper the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain relative 
 to other available treatment options? 
 4. ad hoc expert group agree that the lack of active comparator, in oa and clbp would not hamper the evaluation of efficacy and safety in the studies. the group considered the study designs to be 
 acceptable as there are limited treatment options available for chronic pain (inclusion of cox-inhibitors 
 or opioid analgesic drugs would have excluded many patients from the trial).</p><p>
 the experts were aware that there are other medicines with a similar mechanism of action which from 
 a scientific point of view could be used to elucidate the mechanism of efficacy of duloxetine in oa and 
 clbp (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). however these are not approved for such use.</p><p>
 q5. do you consider the safety and tolerability of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain sufficiently documented? please also consider elderly patients in your assessment. is the safety and tolerability 
 profile of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain likely to be different from that seen in already approved 
 indications for duloxetine? 
 the ad hoc group considers duloxetine to be a safe alternative to nsaids and opioids used chronically. safety of duloxetine in other indications is well documented and could be extrapolated to this patient 
 group including the elderly. in other duloxetine approved indications (diabetic neuropathy) elderly 
 patients have more co-morbidities and therefore the ae profile is not expected to be different in the 
 sought indication.</p><p>
 the low drop-out rate seems to indicate that the drug is well tolerated.</p><p>
 the experts want to highlight the fact that stopping treatment without slow tapering induces 
 withdrawal symptoms (this is well known for other antidepressants as well).</p><p>
 q6. how do you assess the safety and tolerability of duloxetine in chronic somatic pain in the perspective of other treatment options (such as nsaids and opioids)? 
 in the absence of head to head comparison, the experts could only compare the safety and tolerability of dlx to nsaids and opioids in general and not in the sought indication.</p><p> 
 overall, duloxetine seems to have a favourable safety and tolerability profile in oa pain and clbp.</p><p>
 q7. is it possible to identify a restricted target population where the benefit risk ratio of duloxetine is positive in chronic somatic pain? 
 the experts considered that ‘patients with oa or clbp who are not using nsaids (including coxibs) regularly’ is an acceptable restricted target population. 
 in the beginning of the discussions, one expert considered that even the broad indication could be 
 accepted; however he seemed not to oppose the final conclusion given that oa pain and clpb 
 represent around 80% of chronic pain.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 of nsaids is not appropriate or is contraindicated’ unfavourable.</p><p>
 in the chmp’s view the clinical relevance of the marginal short term effect over placebo was 
 questionable and difficult to interpret in the absence of an active comparator, and precluded any 
 conclusion in the long term, particularly in the light of the limited long term evidence provided. the 
 uncertainties in relation to the contribution of the background analgesic treatment and the high rate of 
 withdrawals in duloxetine treatment arms remained, which further questioned the clinical relevance of 
 the effect. 
 in the chmp’s view there are remaining concerns about the safety of the product in the target 
 population where ‘the prolonged use of nsaids is not appropriate or contraindicated’ as this population 
 would mostly include patients which are cardiovascularly compromised or have a history of gi 
 problems, which could be exacerbated by duloxetine. the chmp was of the opinion that without longer 
 term data it could not be concluded that duloxetine would be a safe alternative for this population. 
 the committee maitained its position that the data on the efficacy and safety in the elderly, who would 
 represent a high percentage of the target population and a particularly vulnerable population for cv 
 and gi adverse events, were limited.</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2.

 osteoarthritic pain of at least moderate severity in patients for whom the prolonged use of nsaids is 
 not appropriate or is contraindicated’ has been adequately documented in randomised, placebo-
 controlled clinical trials. based on responder analyses with acceptable responder definitions (such as at 
 least 50% reduction in bpi average pain), the absolute benefit over placebo is statistically significant 
 and clinically meaningful when the difference in proportion of responders is taken into consideration. 
 • 
 in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint analyses, based on the bocf method presented by 
 the applicant, the following trials provide evidence for efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for chronic 
 pain in patients with osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain in non nsaid regular users: 
 a. trial clbp-en (hmen) demonstrated efficacy of duloxetine 60-120 mg in the treatment of chronic 
 low back pain. 
 b. trial clbp-gc (hmgc) demonstrated efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg in the treatment of chronic low 
 back pain. 
 c. trial oa-fg (hmfg) demonstrated efficacy of duloxetine 60-120 mg in the treatment of chronic pain 
 associated with osteoarthritis.</p><p>
 • 
 although there is a lack of long term comparator data, the results from the open-label study 
 are considered acceptable with appropriate recommendations in the smpc. in addition, the results of a 
 long-term study in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain further supported maintenance of effect. 
 furthermore, the company’s proposal to conduct a post marketing maintenance of effect and safety 
 study in oa pain would further substantiate the data of this application. 
 • 
 the safety and tolerability profile of duloxetine in the proposed restricted population is 
 sufficiently established. in this regard, it should be noted that there is extensive experience with 
 duloxetine in other patient populations, including elderly patients, and that there is no reason to 
 assume that the safety and tolerability profile in the proposed indication will be significantly different 
 from indications already approved. 
 • 
 the adverse effects associated with duloxetine are not trivial, but are manageable and should 
 be viewed in the perspective of adverse effects observed with available treatment options such as 
 gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects (nsaids) and sedation, risk of fall and addiction potential 
 (opioids). 
 • 
 in conclusion, considering the provided clinical data and the currently available treatment 
 options, the benefit-risk balance of duloxetine in the proposed population is considered to be positive. 
 • 
 duloxetine would be a potentially valuable alternative for some categories of patients where 
 nsaids are not appropriate and where currently the only other pharmacological option is opioids.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
