 designed to measure the presence and severity of depression in children. the scale consists of 17 
 items scored on a 1- to 5-point scale or 1- to 7-point scale. a rating of 1 indicates normal 
 functioning. total scores range from 17 to 113.</p><p>

 ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</p><p>

 assessment since starting the study drug. the score ranges from 1 (“very much improved&quot;) to 7

 and/or ideations.

 blood pressure, either diastolic or systolic, was 5.6% (4/72). one patient experienced sustained 
 elevation of diastolic blood pressure, and 3 patients experienced sustained elevation of systolic blood 
 pressure.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. discussion on clinical aspects</header><p>duloxetine has been approved in the european union for the treatment of severe urinary incontinence (ariclaim, yentreve) and for the treatment of major depressive disorders, the treatment of diabetic 
 peripheral neuropathic pain and the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (cymbalta, xeristar).</p><p>
 treatment of children and adolescents with duloxetine is not recommended in the approved spc. this 
 study was conducted as part of a paediatric plan committed with the fda. in the eu there is no agreed 
 pip for duloxetine and therefore this is provided as a standalone study in line with the current 6 
 months reporting timeline.</p><p>
 this study was conducted to provide preliminary results on safety and pharmacokinetics in paediatric 
 mdd population. a total of 72 patients aged 7 to 17 years were titrated from 20 (or 30) mg to 120 mg 
 and 41 were treated up to 30 weeks. two third of patients</p><p>were escalated up to 60, 90 or 120 mg 
 dosage, what it is within the range of adult dosage recommendations. the safety profile of duloxetine 
 at those dosages in paediatric population resulted in general similar to that observed in adults. the 
 fragmented method of reporting of aes by study period hampered having a global view of the product. 
 nevertheless, no new safety findings have been observed. of concern, two suicidal ideations and two 
 self-injurious behaviour aes were reported. the evaluation of specific suicide-related outcomes does 
 not provide additional concerns on this issue, what could be considered expectable in the context of 
 the condition.</p><p>
 duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase of the dose. gender (and not 
 age, body weight, creatinine clearance, cyp2d6 status, or dose) was the only characteristic that 
 seemed to influence the pharmacokinetic of duloxetine. as it was observed in adults the inter- and 
 intrapatient variability is very high, with an overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females 
 and males.</p><p>
 children and adolescents involved in the trial suffered a moderate depression. about 7% of patients 
 had previously been treated with psychotherapy and over 40% received antidepressant drugs. of note, 
 amphetamine-derived drugs and atomoxetine were reported by 27/72 patients although apparently 
 only 3 patients reported concomitant attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnose. efficacy 
 parameters measured after 8 weeks and 18 weeks of treatment showed lower scores (response) with 
 respect to baseline scores. the open label design and the small size of the trial make these results 
 inconclusive.</p><p>
 according to the mah statement, results from this study will be informative for the designs of larger, 
 controlled, phase iii studies. at present the current benefit/risk ratio of duloxetine use in children, 
 which is considered negative, should remain without changes in the spc.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>
