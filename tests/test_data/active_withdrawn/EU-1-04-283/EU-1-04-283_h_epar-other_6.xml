 © emea 2006</p></section><section><header>scientific conclusions  overall summary of the scientific evaluation</header><p>following a request from the european commission, the chmp reviewed the data from clinical trials available to the national competent authorities for the following ssri
 1/snris2 products particularly as regards their use in the paediatric population: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, 
 citalopram, escitalopram, atomoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, mianserine, milnacipran, reboxetine, 
 and mirtazapine.</p><p>
 the data reviewed included short-term placebo controlled randomised clinical trials submitted to the 
 competent authorities, randomised clinical trials published in the medical literature, observational 
 studies and ecological studies. the majority of trials included patients with major depressive disorders 
 (mdd) while a few included patients with various anxiety disorders (obsessive compulsive disorder 
 (ocd), generalised anxiety disorder (gad), and social anxiety disorder (sad)). in addition there 
 were some trials with patients suffering from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd).</p><p>
 these products are not authorised europe-wide for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders 
 in children or adolescents. only some of these products are authorised for the treatment of children 
 and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder and only one of them for the treatment of 
 attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p><p>
 examination of suicide-related behaviours indicated that no completed suicide was reported in any of 
 the reviewed studies. however, there was a clear suicide-related behaviours signal from the depression 
 studies and a less strong signal from the anxiety studies. moreover there was a signal concerning 
 related adverse events like hostility, self-harm and emotional lability in almost all products and 
 indications.</p><p>
 with the preliminary review of the data available to the national competent authorities the chmp 
 concluded that there were grounds for concerns about increased suicide-related behaviours in 
 paediatric populations. the chmp agreed that there was a potential signal of an increase in suicidal 
 behaviour, including suicide attempts and suicidal ideation and/or related behaviour like self-harm, 
 hostility and mood lability in children and adolescents treated with ssris and snris. this signal was 
 present in all products for which studies were available, and from the available evidence it could not 
 be excluded that this signal would be class related.</p><p>following the review of the data available to the national competent authorities, the european 
 commission triggered on 17 december 2004 a procedure under article 18 of council regulation 
 (eec) no 2309/93 for medicinal products containing duloxetine. in parallel to this procedure, a referral 
 procedure under article 31 of directive 2001/83/ec, as amended, for medicinal products containing 
 atomoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mianserine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, 
 paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine was triggered.</p><p> 
 1 ssri stands for ‘serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor’. ssris are described as &apos;selective&apos; because they affect only the reuptake pumps responsible for serotonin. 
 2 snri stands for ‘serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor’. snris work on the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitters</p><p>

 the chmp reviewed the data submitted by the mahs in relation to the signal of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents. the chmp concluded that a warning to reflect that suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and 
 adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo, should be included in 
 the summary of product characteristics and relevant section of the package leaflet of ariclaim.</p></section><section><header>grounds for amendment of the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet

 - 
 the committee, in view of available data from clinical trials, concluded that there is a signal of 
 suicidal behaviour, including suicide attempts and suicidal ideation and/or related behaviour 
 like self-harm, hostility and mood lability in children and adolescents treated with selective 
 serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,</p><p>
 - 
 the committee, as a consequence, concluded that a warning to reflect that suicide-related 
 behaviours (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, 
 oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed in clinical trials among 
 children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo, 
 should be included in the summary of product characteristics and relevant section of the 
 package leaflet of ariclaim.</p><p>
 the chmp has recommended the amendment to the terms of the marketing authorisation for 
 ariclaim.
