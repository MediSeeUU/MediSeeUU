 adolescents with major depressive disorder’, in accordance with article 46 of regulation (ec) no 
 1901/2006, as amended. on 11 april 2012 a second study, f1j-mc-hmck (hmck), ‘a double-blind, 
 efficacy and safety study of duloxetine versus placebo in the treatment of children and adolescents 
 with major depressive disorder’ was submitted accompanied by a clinical overview discussing the 
 results of both studies and any considerations for the product information.</p><p>
 these studies are provided in line with the current 6 months reporting timeline. 
 the mah stated that a brief summary of the now submitted paediatric studies results will be proposed 
 for inclusion in the smpc (sections 4.2. and 5.1) within 2 months of the chmp’s assessment of this 
 article 46 filing, in order to provide appropriate smpc wording taking into consideration the chmp’s

 adrenergic receptors.</p><p>
 duloxetine is authorised in eu in adults for the treatment of major depressive episodes; the treatment 
 of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain; the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and for women 
 for the treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence.</p><p>
 studies hmck and hmcl were conducted to comply with a us postmarketing requirement. 
 the phase 2 paediatric study (f1j-mc-hmfn [hmfn1]) that preceded hmck and hmcl was conducted 
 as part of a paediatric plan committed with the fda and submitted per article 46 in april 2009 with 
 chmp outcome on 30 june 2009 (emea/412163/2009).</p><p>
 on 19 october 2009 the applicant submitted to the european medicines agency an application for a 
 paediatric investigation plan including a deferral and a waiver for duloxetine hydrochloride in diabetic 
 neuropathic pain, chronic pain, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and stress 
 urinary incontinence. the european medicines agency adopted a decision granting a waiver for 
 duloxetine hydrochloride for all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 18 years of 
 age; on the grounds that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. [ema decision p/21/2010

 the ema paediatric working party in their assessment of the paediatric needs – psychiatry 
 (emea/288917/2007), considered duloxetine to be devoid of interest to be developed in paediatric 
 psychiatric indications or below the authorised age group.</p><p>
 two separate reports will be provided by the company with pooled data from duloxetine paediatric

 major depressive disorder (mdd).</p><p>
 the design of both studies are the same with the only difference that hmck is a flexible dosing study 
 (60 mg to 120mg once daily) whereas hmcl is a fixed-dose study during the acute treatment period 
 (30 mg and 60 mg once daily). both studies included a fluoxetine treatment arm to test assay 
 sensitivity. 
 a number of plasma samples were collected in both studies in order to characterize the 
 pharmacokinetics of duloxetine at steady-state.</p><p>
 •</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic results</header><p>the findings related to the descriptive summary statistics of duloxetine steady-state concentrations in studies hmcl and hmck have been summarized.</p><p>
 hmcl study 
 a total of 1157 plasma samples (collected throughout the full 36-week study) were obtained from 268 
 patients for the measurement of duloxetine concentrations. 730 quantifiable plasma concentrations 
 from 214 patients were included in the pk evaluation.</p><p>
 of the 214 patients that contributed quantifiable plasma concentrations, 37% were children (aged 7 to 
 11 years) and 63% were adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years). the number of males and females were 
 similar at 48% and 52%, respectively. the majority of the patients were nonsmokers (92%), extensive 
 cyp2d6 metabolizers (84%) and white (59%). seventy percent (70%) of female patients had attained 
 menarche. disposition of doses for the quantifiable plasma concentrations included in the pk 
 assessment was 20%, 30-mg; 46%, 60-mg; 14%, 90-mg; and 20%, 120-mg duloxetine administered 
 once daily. summary statistics for duloxetine concentrations, age, and body weight by dose are 
 presented in table hmcl.11.25 below</p><p> chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>
 page 4/60</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised typical duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase in dose. this apparent dose proportionality was observed for both children and adolescents. for a given dose, the median 
 duloxetine concentrations as well as the range of concentration were similar in children and 
 adolescents. because the pk of duloxetine are linear, dose-normalized plasma concentrations were 
 utilized for subsequent evaluation of the effect of the various patient factors on duloxetine plasma 
 concentrations. 
 hmck study 
 a total of 793 plasma samples were obtained from the patients for the measurement of duloxetine 
 concentrations. 532 quantifiable plasma concentrations from 152 patients were included in the pk 
 evaluation.</p><p>
 of the 152 patients that contributed quantifiable plasma concentrations, 36% were children (7 to 11 
 years old) and 64% were adolescents (12 to 18 years old). the number of males and females were 
 similar at 51% and 49%, respectively. the majority of the patients were nonsmokers (89%), extensive 
 cyp2d6 metabolizers (93%) and caucasian (84%). sixty-four percent (64%) of female patients had 
 attained menarche. disposition of doses for the 532 quantifiable plasma concentrations included in the 
 pk assessment was &lt;1%, 30-mg; 48%, 60-mg; 13%, 90-mg; and 39%, 120-mg duloxetine 
 administered once-daily. summary statistics for duloxetine concentrations, age and body weight by 
 dose are presented in table hmck.11.25 below.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorised duloxetine plasma concentrations appeared to increase in a linear manner with increasing doses in the 
 dose range of 60 to 120 mg as shown in table hmck.11.25. for</p><p>a given dose, there were no 
 discernible differences in median duloxetine concentration in</p><p>children and adolescents; the distribution 
 and range of concentration were similar in the 2</p><p>populations. the median dose-normalized 
 concentration in females is similar to that in males along with the distribution range of duloxetine 
 concentration. similarly, dose-normalized steady state duloxetine concentrations were similar in 
 subgroups defined by ethnicity, race, age and body weight. it should be noted that the number of 
 patients is low for certain ethnicity (hispanics) and race (native american, black, multi-racial) relative 
 to caucasians.</p></section><section><header>rapporteur’s comments:</header><p>the results of the phase ii study (hmfn) showed that duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase of the dose, and that gender (and not age, body weight, creatinine 
 clearance, cyp2d6 status, or dose) was the only characteristic that seemed to influence the 
 pharmacokinetic of duloxetine. as it was observed in adults the inter- and intrapatient variability is 
 very high, with an overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females and males.</p><p>
 in studies hmcl and hmck now submitted subjects received 30 to 120 mg duloxetine doses regardless 
 of they were children or adolescents (30 to 120 mg in hmcl; 60 to 120 mg in hmck). the steady-state 
 duloxetine plasma concentrations increased with increasing dose in both children and adolescents. no 
 relevant differences in cmax and auc were observed between the two age groups. patient 
 characteristics such as cyp2d6 metabolizer status, ethnicity, sex, age, and body weight did not appear 
 to have an effect on steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations. no dose adjustment seems to be 
 required in the adolescent population with respect to the younger group.</p><p>
 the mah states that a comprehensive report on the population pk of duloxetine in children and 
 adolescents using data collected from this study and others will be provided as a separate report. in 
 that report, pk data from this study will be analysed using population modelling approaches along with 
 data from studies hmfn, hmcl and hmck.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 the main proof of efficacy relies on the relief of the depression symptoms after 10 weeks of treatment.</p><p>
 in addition to the comparison with placebo an active arm (fluoxetine) was included in order to provide 
 assay sensitivity to the trial. fluoxetine is authorized in eu countries by mutual recognition procedure 
 with the indication in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above (moderate to severe major 
 depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4-6 sessions). it can 
 be accepted as an adequate control treatment. after the acute phase, patients entered in an extension

 majority of these events resolved during the study, as evidenced by the lower frequency of events 
 noted at endpoint (4.2% high systolic and 3.4% high diastolic). for patients in the duloxetine group, 
 less than 2% of patients (n=4 systolic, n=5 diastolic) with normal systolic or diastolic blood pressure 
 at baseline met criteria for sustained elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, which is less than 
 the rate of sustained elevation of blood pressure reported in duloxetine-treated adult mdd patients

 weight loss was not reported as an sae during either study and no patient discontinued from the study 
 due to weight loss. 
 it is important to evaluate growth relative to the general population using standardized height and 
 weight scores. a z-score (or the standard deviation score) is one such analysis; that is, a z-score 
 analysis normalizes a patient’s weight to their age and sex-matched peers (specifically, the us 
 population for the analyses below, since reference data from other countries were not available). a z-
 score of zero, therefore, would be equivalent to the median weight of the reference population; a z-
 score of -0.67 and 0.67 are approximately equivalent to the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, 
 respectively, of the reference population. this analysis was performed for the mean change of weight, 
 height, and body-mass index (tables 5.7 and 5.8)</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 in principle there appear to be no new signal of safety concerns in children and adolescents related to 
 duloxetine treatment. the nature of the adverse events reported, involving primarily gastrointestinal, 
 psychiatric and nervous system disorders, is consistent with that of adult studies as stated in the 
 smpc. nausea, headache, abdominal pain, somnolence, dizziness, decreased appetite, fatigue, 
 diarrhoea, vomiting and insomnia were the most frequent reported aes (&gt;5%). qualitatively, 
 duloxetine and fluoxetine appear to be similar; however, duloxetine safety profile seems to be more 
 adverse than that reported for fluoxetine. duloxetine showed a higher incidence of most of adverse 
 events; children and adolescents treated with duloxetine were more prone to withdraw for safety 
 reasons than patients treated with fluoxetine.</p><p>

 for the treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence. it is not recommended for use in 
 children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy. 
 the mah has submitted the results of two phase iii randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled 
 studies of duloxetine in paediatric patients with major depressive disorder (f1j-mc-hmcl and f1j-mc-
 hmck). a fluoxetine control arm was included for assay sensitivity.</p><p>
 after 10 weeks of treatment neither duloxetine nor fluoxetine did separate from placebo in none of the 
 studies. no relevant differences were observed when the investigator made the global assessment of 
 the response. the secondary endpoints results were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. 
 in addition, no dose-response relationship could be identified when duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg were 
 administered. when doses were increased during the extension phases, both groups experienced an 
 improvement in symptoms. the lack of a placebo arm and the flexible regimen of dosing administered 
 hamper drawing sound conclusions. subgroup analysis by age does not suggest benefit in a particular 
 stratum. the antidepressant effect of duloxetine in children and adolescents has not been 
 demonstrated.</p><p>
 respecting pharmacokinetics, the steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations increased with 
 increasing dose in both children and adolescents. no relevant differences in cmax and auc were 
 observed between the two age groups. patient characteristics such as cyp2d6 metabolizer status, 
 ethnicity, sex, age, and body weight did not appear to have an effect on steady-state duloxetine 
 plasma concentrations. no dose adjustment seems to be required in the adolescent population with 
 respect to the younger group. for enrichment of these data, an additional analysis population pk 
 modelling on the integrated dataset from hmfn, hmck and hmcl studies comprised by the company is 
 expected. 
 in principle there appear to be no new signal of safety concerns in children and adolescents related to 
 duloxetine treatment. with regard to the comparison with fluoxetine, both medications products 
 appear to be qualitatively similar; however, duloxetine safety profile seems to be more adverse than 
 that reported for fluoxetine. this information is deemed useful for prescribers and therefore it should 
 be translated to the smpc. additional data for clarification is requested.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 • there was no effect on male or female fertility. • minor, transient effects on neurobehaviour at 45 mg/kg/day, consisted of an increased number of errors in the path b configuration of the cincinnati water maze test performed during the 
 treatment period, suggesting that these animals had difficulty with “elective-choice” sequential 
 learning. the number of errors and the time taken to complete the maze (both path a and path 
 b) were comparable to controls at all dose levels during the posttreatment period. motor

 duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adults. there was no effect on fertility in the juvenile 
 rat studies. minor effects on neurobehaviour at 45 mg/kg/day in a water maze test were transient and 
 did not persist. therefore, these findings have no clinically meaningful impact and do not indicate any 
 safety concerns relevant to a paediatric population. we propose to add the important clinical safety 
 information from the paediatric studies in the smpc as per chmp’s request. for duloxetine, the mah 
 consider the paediatric clinical data to be the most relevant information for the prescriber, as opposed 
 to the nonclinical juvenile data which did not reveal any safety concerns or clinically relevant findings. 
 additionally, since the duloxetine paediatric data do not support an indication in this population, it is 
 our view that the inclusion of the juvenile toxicity data, even if it were for completeness’ sake, is not 
 warranted. thus, results from the nonclinical juvenile rat studies are not proposed for inclusion in the

 are limited due to small numbers within the subgroups. because the primary focus of this section is to 
 assess whether the safety profile is similar between the children and adolescent subgroups, the results 
 discussed here include treatment by-subgroup interactions and within-subgroup treatment (duloxetine 
 versus placebo) comparisons. 
 overall, during the acute- or extension-treatment phases, few statistically significant treatment-by-
 subgroup interaction were observed in the analyses of saes, dc due to ae, teaes, standard laboratory 
 and vital signs, indicating that the safety profile of duloxetine was similar between age subgroups.</p><p>the reported saes during the acute treatment phase in the adolescent duloxetine group were drug 
 abuse, hallucination, intentional overdose (2 reports), panic attack, self-injurious behaviour, social

 medicinal product no longer authorisedstudy entry but the event did not become serious until hospitalization during study period iii. in summary, no new safety signals were identified.</p><p>the only statistically significant finding was more 
 discontinuations due to adverse events in the adolescent duloxetine group (9.5%) than the adolescent 
 placebo group (2.2%, p=.009) during acute treatment. this rate of dc due to an ae is consistent with, 
 and lower than, that observed in adult clinical studies of duloxetine. the only event reported by more 
 than 2 patients in one subgroup was nausea, which was more frequent in the duloxetine-treated 
 adolescent (4 events) than child (2 events) subgroup, with no discontinuations due to nausea in either 
 placebo group. when compared with the adult patient population, the rate of discontinuation was lower 
 in paediatric patients. the frequency of teaes was similar between treatment groups and across 
 subpopulations and no statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed. 
 headache was the most frequently reported teae in duloxetine-treated adolescents (n, %: 41, 20% 
 duloxetine; 11, 8.0% placebo), followed closely by nausea (n,%: 38, 19% duloxetine; 15, 11% 
 placebo). nausea was the most frequently reported teae in duloxetine-treated children (n,%: 21, 15% 
 duloxetine; 7, 8% placebo), followed by headache (n,%: 17, 12% duloxetine; 14, 16% placebo). the 
 other teaes reported in duloxetine-treated patients also were consistent with the know safety profile 
 of duloxetine. thus, no notable differences in the nature or frequency of teaes were observed between 
 subgroups. 
 during extension treatment phase two children and 2 adolescents reported a suicide attempt. one 
 male adolescent patient was hospitalized for the sae of suspected stevens-johnson syndrome. the 
 other reported saes are either not unexpected in a psychiatric population or most likely not related to 
 study drug. the frequency of dc due to an ae and teaes was similar between treatment groups and 
 between subgroups. no single event was reported more frequently as the reason for discontinuation in 
 either treatment group or subpopulation. these dc due to an ae rates are comparable to those 
 observed in longer-term adult clinical studies of duloxetine. the most commonly reported (
 ≥5%) teaes in the duloxetine-treated adolescent subgroup were nausea, headache, vomiting, abdominal 
 pain upper, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness. the first 4 of these teaes were also commonly reported in 
 the duloxetine-treated children subgroup. additionally, children commonly reported pyrexia and 
 influenza. overall, however, the reported teaes did not form an obvious differential pattern between 
 children and adolescents. as noted above, these events are consistent with the safety profile of 
 duloxetine within the adult population. 
 analyses of laboratory data 
 abnormal laboratory values were defined as outside of the covance reference range of normal. overall, 
 no clinically meaningful differences were observed between duloxetine and placebo (acute) or dlx and 
 pla/dlx (extension) groups with regards to abnormally high or low laboratory values. similarly, while 
 statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed for some analytes, the 
 differences were not considered clinically meaningful either due to the direction of the abnormal 
 change or the apparent resolution of abnormal values at endpoint. further, no saes or discontinuations 
 related to abnormal laboratory values were reported. 
 during the acute treatment phase one statistically significant interaction was noted for low total 
 bilirubin. this finding was driven by a greater duloxetine/placebo difference in children compared with 
 duloxetine/placebo difference in adolescents. however, low total bilirubin was not considered a 
 clinically relevant finding. the frequency of patients meeting abnormal criteria on any laboratory value 
 at endpoint was lower, in general, than that observed at any time. abnormally high platelet count and 
 abnormal red blood cell morphology was observed statistically significantly more frequently at endpoint</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorisedwithin the adolescent duloxetine group compared with the adolescent placebo group; however, these were not considered a clinically relevant finding. 
 for extension-phase analyses, the baseline is the end of the acute phase. in general, the frequency of 
 patients meeting abnormal criteria at any time and at endpoint was lower during extension treatment 
 than acute treatment. the following abnormal criteria at any time occurred more frequently in children 
 than adolescents and were reported by at least 5% of patients in the total duloxetine group (dlx/dlx 
 plus pla/dlx arms): high alanine aminotransferase, low bilirubin total, high calcium, high cholesterol, 
 high creatinine, high eosinophils, high platelet count, and high hematocrit. conversely, the following 
 abnormal criteria were met at any time by at least 5% of patients in the total duloxetine group and by 
 adolescents more frequently than children: high albumin, high alkaline phosphatase, high creatine 
 phosphokinase, low glucose, high uric acid, low erythrocyte count, low mean cell hemoglobin 
 (concentration), urinalysis (ua) occult blood, ua protein. overall, when considering results from the 
 acute and extension treatment, while the frequency of patients meeting some abnormal laboratory 
 analyte criteria was higher in one subgroup over another, no clinically meaningful pattern was 
 observed. therefore, no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile were observed between 
 the children and adolescent subgroups. 
 analyses of vital signs and electrocardiogram results 
 analyses of categorical data were performed in addition to mean change from baseline to identify the 
 frequency of patients meeting potentially clinically significant (pcs) increases for the specified 
 parameters.</p><p>overall, the results did not reveal a clinically meaningful differences between adolescents 
 or children with respect to vital signs or ecgs. nevertheless, these data should be interpreted with 
 caution due to the limited number of patients meeting abnormal categorical criteria. 
 no statistically significant differences in mean change in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
 pressure, pulse were observed between duloxetine and placebo in either the children or adolescent 
 subgroups. both duloxetine-treated children and duloxetine-treated adolescents experienced mean 
 decrease in weight that was statistically significant when compared with placebo-treated children and 
 adolescent patients, respectively. a statistically significant within-subgroup difference in low systolic 
 blood pressure was observed in children, but the frequency was higher in placebo (3, 3.6%) than 
 duloxetine (0, 0%). no other within-subgroup differences in blood pressure or pulse were observed 
 during the acute-treatment period. few patients in any treatment group met criteria for sustained 
 elevation (that is, meeting pcs criteria for at least 3 consecutive visits) during the acute-treatment 
 period. for sustained elevation in diastolic blood pressure, a total of 2 adolescents, both in the placebo 
 group, and 1 child in the duloxetine group met sustained diastolic blood pressure criteria. no 
 discontinuations due to sustained elevation in blood pressure were reported. for sustained elevation in 
 systolic blood pressure, 1 adolescent in the duloxetine group and 2 adolescents in the placebo group 
 met sustained criteria. no children met sustained elevation in systolic blood pressure criteria during 
 acute treatment. treatment-by-subgroup interaction test could not be performed due to no events in 
 some subgroups. overall, however, few patients experienced sustained elevation in blood pressure, 
 suggesting that elevations in blood pressure during acute treatment were sporadic. 
 for electrocardiogram results, few treatment-by-subgroup interactions were calculated due to lack of 
 events in at least 1 treatment arm.</p><p> chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorised for patients randomised to duloxetine and remaining on duloxetine during extension treatment, children generally experienced a greater mean increase in blood pressure and pulse when compared 
 with adolescents. however, the differences in the mean changes were small (
 ≤2 mm hg) and not likely clinically significant. these results observed during extension treatment are consistent with those 
 observed during acute treatment. conversely, for patients initially randomised to placebo and switched 
 to duloxetine during the extension treatment, the mean increase in blood pressure and pulse was 
 generally greater in adolescents than children. these observations are not likely clinically significant 
 because the adolescents transitioning from placebo to duloxetine had vital-sign changes similar to 
 those seen by the adolescents treated with duloxetine in the acute phase. a greater frequency of 
 children (13%) met pcs high diastolic blood pressure at any time when compared with adolescents 
 (9%) in the duloxetine group. a similar result was observed for pcs high systolic blood pressure at any 
 time, where children (12%) met the criteria more frequently than adolescents (9%) in the duloxetine 
 group. few duloxetine-treated patients met criteria for pcs high pulse, with a total of 2 (0.8%) 
 adolescents meeting criteria at any time during extension treatment. these observations do not 
 support a differential tolerability regarding blood pressure between the child and adolescent 
 duloxetine-treated subgroups. no duloxetine-treated children or adolescents met criteria for sustained 
 elevation in diastolic blood pressure during extension treatment. one adolescent in the duloxetine 
 group met criteria for sustained elevation in systolic blood pressure during extension treatment. as 
 with the acute-treatment phase, few patients met criteria, limiting the ability to draw conclusions and 
 suggesting that any noted abnormal elevations in blood pressure were sporadic. a total of 2 (0.9%) 
 duloxetine-treated adolescents and 4 children (3%) in the duloxetine group met low heart rate criteria. 
 for qtcf results, no duloxetine-treated children or adolescents met high or abnormal increase criteria.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 mah response</header><p>for the acute-treatment phase, completion rates were comparable across treatment groups in study hmcl (approximately 70%) and study hmck (75% and 78% for duloxetine and fluoxetine 
 respectively). the most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was an ae, with patients in the 
 duloxetine group dc due to ae more frequently than patients in the fluoxetine group, primarily due to 
 the event of nausea. for the extension period, completion rates were approximately 60% across 
 treatment groups in study hmcl and approximately 80% in study hmck. the most frequently 
 reported reason for discontinuation in the duloxetine and fluoxetine groups was patient or caregiver 
 decision.</p><p>
 because the comparison of interest is between duloxetine and fluoxetine, characterization of the safety 
 profiles over long-term treatment requires analysis of only those patients initially randomised to 
 duloxetine or to fluoxetine. this avoids selection bias by not including patients initially randomised to 
 placebo who are then switched to duloxetine during extension treatment. 
 the frequency of dc due to an ae in the acute treatment phase was statistically significantly higher 
 with duloxetine than with fluoxetine. this difference was primarily driven by discontinuations due to 
 nausea: 6 (1.8%) reports with duloxetine and 0 reports with fluoxetine. the frequency of teaes was 
 also similar across the treatment groups. the individual teaes of nausea (17%, 11%) and dizziness 
 (8.5%, 3.8%) were reported statistically significantly more frequently with duloxetine compared with 
 fluoxetine. discontinuation due to an ae remained higher in the duloxetine group than the fluoxetine 
 group at study endpoint; as noted above, this was primarily driven by the greater frequency of 
 discontinuations due to nausea with duloxetine (7, 2.2%) than fluoxetine (0, 0%, p=.032). the median 
 time to discontinuation due to nausea was 41 days. of note, 6 of the 7 nausea events reported as a 
 reason for discontinuation from duloxetine occurred during the acute-treatment period. this is 
 consistent with the known profile of duloxetine, where nausea, a commonly reported ae upon 
 duloxetine initiation, tends to resolve with continued duloxetine treatment. the only other aes reported 
 by more than 2 patients in a treatment group as a reason for discontinuation was depression for 
 duloxetine (4, 1.2%, versus 0, 0% with fluoxetine) and aggression for fluoxetine (3, 1.3% versus 1, 
 0.3% with duloxetine).</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 were not considered clinically meaningful. analyses of treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory 
 analytes did not reveal any statistically significant differences between duloxetine and fluoxetine during 
 acute treatment. during extension treatment, low levels of lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed 
 at least 2 times more frequently with fluoxetine than duloxetine (that is, the dlx/dlx group). low 
 levels of mean cell hemoglobin and neutrophils, as well as high neutrophil and abnormal protein levels 
 occurred at least 2 times more frequently with duloxetine than fluoxetine. these differences were not 
 considered clinically meaningful, however.</p><p>
 with respect to mean change from baseline (blood pressure and pulse), pcs abnormalities (blood 
 pressure and pulse) and sustained elevations of blood pressure, no statistically significant differences 
 were observed between duloxetine and fluoxetine. a statistically significant difference for mean change 
 in qtcf was observed between duloxetine and fluoxetine, with patients in the duloxetine group 
 experiencing a mean decrease and those in the fluoxetine group experiencing a mean increase. overall 
 mean changes were small (increase or decrease of less than 4 msec), however, and not considered 
 clinically relevant for either drug. categorical analyses of qtcf identified 1 male patient (0.4%) in the 
 duloxetine group who experienced an abnormal increase in qtcf interval (that is, an increase of 
 greater than 40 msec from baseline). one male patient (0.6%) in the fluoxetine group met the gender-
 specific high qtcf criteria (
 ≥450 msec). neither patient met pcs criteria for qtcf (an absolute interval &gt;500 msec). abnormal high heart rate was reported in 1 (0.4%) duloxetine-treated patient and no

 longer-term data are important for assessing cardiovascular risk. to this end, data from the combined 
 acute and extension phase treatment periods (36 weeks) were pooled from both studies to ascertain 
 the frequency and duration of pcs vital signs and sustained elevation in blood pressure. in this pooled 
 analyses, only patients randomised to duloxetine or fluoxetine at the beginning of the studies were 
 analysed. in other words, patients randomised to placebo were excluded since these patients were 
 only exposed to duloxetine for 26 weeks and not the complete study duration. categorical analyses of 
 blood pressure at endpoint compared with at any time suggest that the majority of pcs events at any 
 time occurring in the duloxetine and fluoxetine groups tended to resolve during the studies, as 
 evidenced by the lower frequency of events at endpoint (table 8.3). with respect to sustained 
 elevation of blood pressure, less than 2% of patients in the duloxetine and fluoxetine groups met 
 criteria for sustained elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure. overall, therefore, no new signal 
 with respect to pulse and blood pressure was identified.</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorised with respect to ecg results, a mean increase in heart rate of 2.8 bpm was observed for the duloxetine group, while a mean decrease (-2.3 bpm) was observed in the fluoxetine group over the 36 weeks of 
 the study. patients in the duloxetine group experienced a mean decrease in qtcf (-1.9 msec) while 
 those in the fluoxetine group experienced a mean increase (2.3 msec). the difference between 
 treatment groups for both heart rate and qtcf were both statistically significant (&lt;.001 and .005, 
 respectively). over the entire study, 1 duloxetine-treated patient experienced abnormal high heart rate 
 and 1 duloxetine-treated patient experienced abnormal increase in qtcf interval, and both events 
 occurred during acute treatment. there were 3 patients in the fluoxetine group who experienced 
 gender-specific high qtcf (
 ≥470 msec for females and ≥450 msec for males), with 1 event occurring during acute treatment. there were 3 patients in the fluoxetine group with abnormal increase in qtcf 
 interval (&gt;40 msec increase) from study baseline. 
 in order to provide more robust comparisons for suicide-related events between duloxetine and 
 fluoxetine accounting for differences in number of patients assigned to each treatment group and 
 duration of exposure, an exposure adjusted analysis was conducted for the overall population, and also 
 for each age subgroup (children and adolescent). exposure adjusted incidence rate (eair), that is, 
 number of patients with events divided by the total patient years, was calculated separately for acute 
 phase, extension phase, as well as acute and extension phase combined. eair was compared between 
 treatment groups for acute phase or acute and extension phase combined using miettinen and 
 nurminen (mn) method (miettinen and nurminen 1985; chan and wang 2009). there were no 
 completed suicides in studies hmck and hmcl. the frequency of treatment emergent suicidal ideation

 differences between duloxetine and fluoxetine for eair for overall population or for the adolescent 
 subgroups.</p><p>
 the frequency of treatment emergent suicidal ideation as collected via c-ssrs was similar across all

 frequency generally being greater in adolescents. suicidal behaviour as collected via c-ssrs occurred 
 in &lt;1% of patients within the pbo/dlx and flx/flx treatment groups and in 2.6% of patients in the

 regarding exposure adjusted analyses for the extension-treatment phase, the number of events 
 (ideation or behaviour) per patient years was similar for duloxetine and fluoxetine. more specifically, 
 even though the actual number of suicide behaviours was greater for duloxetine compared with 
 fluoxetine, the difference between duloxetine and fluoxetine treatment groups in the exposure

 an additional exposure adjusted analysis using data from c-ssrs over the 36-week study for patients 
 initially randomised to duloxetine or fluoxetine shows no statistically significant difference in the eair

 no new signals were identified with regard to suicide-related events or non-suicidal self-injurious 
 behaviour. results with regard to the frequency of suicidality (ideation or behaviour) for studies hmck 
 and hmcl are fairly consistent with previously published studies of antidepressants in the treatment of 
 children and adolescents with mdd. the smpc currently contains a class labelling warning for both 
 duloxetine and fluoxetine regarding use in paediatric patients and suicide-related events (ideation, 
 behaviour) (smpc section 4.4). the recommendation for carefully monitoring of paediatric patients 
 with mdd for the appearance of suicidal symptoms remains a suitably cautious clinical approach. 
 overall, no clinically important differences in safety and tolerability findings were noted between 
 duloxetine and fluoxetine except for a higher rate of dc due to an ae with duloxetine, which was 
 driven by nausea. results of laboratory analyses of mean change and treatment-emergent abnormal 
 values reveal similar mean changes and frequencies of abnormal laboratory values between duloxetine 
 and fluoxetine, but these differences were not considered clinically meaningful. similarly, with the 
 possible exception of modest mean increase of qtcf interval with fluoxetine, no meaningful differences 
 between duloxetine and fluoxetine were observed from analyses of vital signs and ecg parameters 
 during acute treatment or over the entire study. no new safety signals were identified with regard to 
 suicide-related events (ideation, behaviour) or non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour during acute 
 treatment or extension treatment. even though the actual number of suicide behaviours was greater 
 for duloxetine compared with fluoxetine, the difference between duloxetine and fluoxetine treatment 
 groups in the exposure adjusted incidence rate was smaller due to greater number of patients exposed 
 to duloxetine.</p></section><section><header>rapporteur’s comments:</header><p>more patients in the duloxetine than the fluoxetine group discontinued due to an adverse events in the acute treatment, principally due to nausea. discontinuation rates due to an ae remained higher in the</p><p>chmp assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 differences between duloxetine and fluoxetine observed in laboratory-related data were not considered

 ecgs were small for both duloxetine and fluoxetine in these studies, generally not considered clinically 
 meaningful, and concordant with known safety profile of both compounds. a mean increase in heart 
 rate and a mean decrease in qtcf were observed for the duloxetine group over the 36 weeks of the 
 study (statistically significant compared with fluoxetine).</p><p>
 an exposure adjusted analysis was conducted for suicide-related events including those patients 
 initially randomized to placebo and switched to duloxetine in the extension phase. suicidal ideation 
 occurred in a similar proportion of patients in all treatment groups and occurred in both children and 
 adolescents, with the frequency being greater in adolescent. in the acute phase the number of events 
 (suicidal ideation or behaviour) per patient years was similar for duloxetine and fluoxetine. during 
 extension treatment the number of suicidal behaviours was greater for duloxetine (2.6% ) compared 
 with fluoxetine (0.6%) and placebo/fluoxetine (0.6%).</p><p>
 when the incidence rate was adjusted by exposure, these differences between treatment for the 
 extension-treatment phase were smaller (duloxetine: 0.04 events per py; fluoxetine: 0.01 events per 
 py; placebo/duloxetine: 0.01 events per py). it must be due to greater number of patients exposed to 
 duloxetine. when looking at the exposure adjusted analysis over the 36-week study, no statistically 
 significant differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for suicidal behaviour were observed 
 between duloxetine and fluoxetine in the overall patient population or within the child or adolescent 
 subgroup (duloxetine: 0.04 events per py; fluoxetine: 0.03 events per py; p=.646). there were not 
 remarkable differences respecting non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour.</p><p>
 the higher numbers of suicidal behaviour in patients treated with duloxetine compared with those 
 receiving fluoxetine can be considered as a safety signal that, although it is not possible to objectively 
 assign to duloxetin, could represent a matter of concern. 
 in view of all of these uncertainties this information is considered sufficiently relevant for physicians to 
 be included in the smpc.</p></section><section><header>clinical request 6 the mah should provide the data regarding monitoring of some key events that has not

 in studies hmck and hmcl, no patient had an sae related to laboratory results, and no patient 
 discontinued due to abnormal laboratory values. a new analysis of spontaneously reported hepatic-
 related teaes was performed using pooled data from hmck and hmcl. based on this analysis, few 
 patients were identified who experienced a hepatic-related teae during the 36 weeks of either study. 
 specifically, during the acute phase, 1 patient in each treatment group experienced 1 hepatic-related 
 teae: in the duloxetine group, alt increased; in the fluoxetine group, hepatic steatosis; in the placebo 
 group, hepatic enzyme increased. during the extension phase, 1 (0.6%) patient who continued 
 duloxetine in the extension phase (dlx/dlx group) and 2 (1.1%) patients who continued fluoxetine in 
 the extension phase experienced alt increase. one patient who switched from placebo to duloxetine 
 for the extension phase experienced alt increase. an analysis of mean change in chemistry and 
 hematologic laboratory analytes was performed using the acute analyses set. for chemistry analytes 
 related to hepatology, the difference between duloxetine and placebo was statistically significant 
 (p&lt;.05) only for ggt (-1.20, -0.32). however, this finding is not considered clinically meaningful since 
 a decrease is not indicative of liver injury. no clinically meaningful differences were noted between 
 duloxetine and fluoxetine. no patients met hy’s rule criteria. treatment-emergent alt 
 ≥3 times uln was reported in the extension analyses set for 1 patient in the duloxetine group and 1 patient in 
 fluoxetine group. the patient in the duloxetine group (17 year old male) was initially randomised to 
 placebo and then transitioned to duloxetine for the extension period. the patient had an abnormal alt 
 value at baseline and experienced a treatment emergent alt increase to 
 ≥3 times uln at the last study visit while taking duloxetine (week 36). the patient completed the study by entering the taper 
 phase, during which time the patient’s alt levels decreased towards normal values by the end of the 
 taper phase. for the patient in the fluoxetine group, a 17 year old male, had a treatment-emergent 
 alt 
 ≥3 times uln that reached levels ≥5 times during uln study period iii. the patient’s alt elevation persisted for approximately 9 weeks reaching a maximum of 216 u/l (5 times uln) 
 approximately 6 weeks after the initial alt elevation. the patient’s alt returned to normal at 
 approximately the 28- and 32-week time points while the patient continued on fluoxetine 40 mg qd. 
 overall, therefore, no new hepatic-related safety concerns for duloxetine were noted within the 
 paediatric population in these studies. 
 2. severe cutaneous reactions 
 a standard meddra query was performed using the acute and long-term analyses sets. one possible 
 case of stevens-johnson syndrome was identified (this case was reported in the risk management 
 plan (rmp) v9 submitted in october 2011). as summarised in the hmcl study report, this 15-year-old 
 male in the duloxetine group was hospitalized for suspected sjs 137 days after starting duloxetine, 
 and discontinued treatment on the day of hospitalization. the patient was experiencing symptoms of 
 sinus infection, temperature, fatigue, and headache for approximately 2-3 months prior to the 
 hospitalization. the patient also developed blisters in the mouth, cough, and conjunctivitis. no rash or
