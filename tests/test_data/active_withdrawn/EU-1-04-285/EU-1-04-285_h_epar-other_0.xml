 following the assessment of the apidra risk management 
 plan, the mah was requested to submit a type ii variation 
 to revise the smpc and pl to make more prominent the 
 risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) associated with pump 
 administration and to include advice on how to manage the 
 condition. in addition, the mah was asked to respond to a 
 list of questions on the stability of apidra in pump systems 
 for with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (csii). 
      page 9/23 accordingly. the amendments to the product information are only applicable to the apidra 100 
 units/ml solution for injection in a vial, as this is the 
 only presentation that can be used in a pump 
 system.
  the mah has also submitted data clarifying the 
 stability of apidra in pump systems for csii which 
 was also requested in rmp 025.6.
  in addition, the mah took the opportunity to update 
 the list of local representatives in the package 
 leaflet.
  furthermore, the pi is being brought in line with the 
 latest qrd template version 9.0. 
  the requested variation proposed amendments to 
 the summary of product characteristics, annex ii 
 and package leaflet.

 psur, rmp, fum/so, data submitted under article

 change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
 mah 
  
 the amendments to the product information are only 
 applicable to the apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection 
 in a vial, as this is the only presentation that can be used in 
 a pump system.
  the mah agreed to amend section 4.4 of the smpc to 
 include information on the risk of dka occurring in 
 association with csii.  additionally the mah included 
 “hyperglycaemia (potentially leading to diabetic 
 ketoacidosis)” in section 4.8 with a frequency of 
 “unknown”. the mah also agreed that advice already in 
 section 6.6 should be included in section 4.2. the package 
 leaflet has been amended to highlight this risk to patients 
 (given that patients will self-administer apidra using csii).  
  the updated text in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the smpc reads 
 as follows:
  4.2 
 posology and method of administration
  method of administration
  continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
  apidra may be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin 
 infusion (csii) in pump systems suitable for insulin 
 infusion with the appropriate catheters and reservoirs. 
 patients using csii should be comprehensively instructed 
 on the use of the pump system.
  the infusion set and reservoir used with apidra must be 
 changed at least every 48 hours using aseptic technique. 
 these instructions may differ from general pump manual 
 instructions. it is important that patients follow the apidra 
 specific instructions when using apidra. failure to follow 
 apidra specific instructions may lead to serious adverse 
 events. 
  when used with a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, 
 apidra must not be mixed with diluents or any other 
      page 10/23 insulin. patients administering apidra by csii must have an 
 alternative insulin delivery system available in case of 
 pump system failure (see section 4.4 and 4.8).
   4.4 special warnings and precautions for use
  continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
  malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or handling 
 errors can rapidly lead to hyperglycaemia, ketosis and 
 diabetic ketoacidosis. prompt identification and correction 
 of the cause of hyperglycaemia or ketosis or diabetic 
 ketoacidosis is necessary. 
  cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported when 
 apidra has been given in continuous subcutaneous insulin 
 infusion in pump systems. most of the cases were related 
 to handling errors or pump system failure.
  interim subcutaneous injections with apidra may be 
 required. patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin 
 infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer 
 insulin by injection and have alternative insulin delivery 
 system available in case of pump system failure (see 
 section 4.2 and 4.8).

 smpc, annex 
 ii, labelling 
 and pl 
 update of the labelling documents for three sanofi-aventis 
 insulins is proposed in this type ii variation to reinforce the 
 appropriate use of solostar prefilled pen.
  this update is based on the experience gained since 2006 
 (e.g. following reports and questions raised by the pen 
 users) and a continued evaluation of possible 
 improvements of the product information.
  during this period a number of product technical complaints 
 were received concerning the functionality of the pen, 
 namely a blocked pen, where it is impossible to dial or 
 inject a dose.
  the cause was identified that when dialling a dose and 
 pushing the dose button without a needle attached to the 
 pen, a mechanical pressure within the system builds, 
 leading to a blockage of the pen mechanism. for this 
 reason the instructions for use are updated to make the 
      page 13/23  patient aware not to dial a dose or push the dose button without having a needle attached. there was no technical 
 change made to the solostar prefilled pen.

 the portfolio of the mah contains several different insulins 
 with several insulin delivery devices (idd), including the re-
 usable devices (optipen pro and opticlik) and the 
 device/drug combinations (pre-filled disposable pens 
 optiset and solostar).
  the complexity regarding the various insulin treatments 
 used in a single diabetic patient, (i.e. long acting, rapid 
 acting; with the latter needing to be administered multiple 
 times a day) in order to achieve optimal glycaemia control 
 has created a situation wherein product differentiation 
 becomes increasingly important.
  adverse events associated with insulins mix-ups, often 
 result in massive overdose of the rapid-acting insulin which 
 may subsequently lead to hypoglycaemia, which if left 
 untreated may be life-threatening, or result in death. in 
 most cases, however, the patients noticed the mistake and 
 took measures to avoid hypoglycaemia, which may explain 
 the large number of cases with no ae or non-serious cases. 
  in order to mitigate the risk of medication errors, the mah 
 has focused its efforts up to now on educational activities 
 to ensure the safe administration of their insulins. the mah 
 has also focused on differentiation strategies for insulin 
 products to mitigate the potential risk of administering the 
 wrong insulin to a person with diabetes.
  the product information for all the insulins from this mah 
      page 16/23 has been updated through the present variation to include warnings on the risk of insulin mix-up.
  additionally, the mah will incorporate changes to the 
 existing insulins packaging. the aim of these changes is to 
 better differentiate the different products and to increase 
 readability for the pharmacist, health care professional or 
 patient in order to reduce potential mix-ups.

 after the experience gained from user surveys and outside

 optiset instructions for use and the summary of product 
 characteristics of the optiset presentations for apidra. the

 the purpose of the change is to implement a technical 
 improvement to optiset in order to prevent mishandling of 
 the pen, and thus to improve the safety of the device 
 particularly when it is wrongly used. in addition, the trade 
 name of the insulin will be printed on the pen, to enable a 
 complete differentiation from other insulins provided with 
 the optiset pen. the data provided was adequate and 
 satisfactory and the proposed changes were acceptable. 
 the instructions for use of the pen have been updated 
 accordingly.

 optiset device and to highlight the most important 
 handling steps for the use of the optiset in a more 
 prominent way. these changes include an additional 
 warning statement (in sections 4.2 and 4.4) that the 
 instructions for handling in section 6.6 should be carefully 
 followed.  the handling of optiset was updated based on 
 readability test results.
   accordingly, the package leaflet (pl) has been revised for 
 improved clarity including a revision of the instructions for 
 the use of apidra (optiset presentations). a caution 
 statement has also been added to the outer carton.
   in addition, the term &quot;international units&quot; was substituted 
 by &quot;units&quot; in all package leaflets (vial, cartridge, cartridge 
 for opticlik, optiset), in line with the chmp 
 recommendations and the labelling approved for apidra.
