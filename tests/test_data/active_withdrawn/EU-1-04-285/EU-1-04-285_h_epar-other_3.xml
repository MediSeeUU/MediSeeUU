 insulin by two amino-acid substitution on the b chain of the protein (replacement of asparagine in 
 position b3 by lysine and lysine in position b29 by glutamic acid). thus, insulin glulisine is a close 
 structural relative to human insulin.</p><p>
 apidra was authorised by the centralised procedure (eu/1/04/285) in 27 september 2004 for the 
 treatment of adult patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>
 in this type ii variation the marketing authorisation holder (mah) applied to add a new indication 
 to the apidra spc. the proposed therapeutic indication was for the use of apidra in: “adolescents and 
 children of 4 years or above with diabetes mellitus, where treatment with insulin is required”.</p><p>
 the mah proposed to make changes to sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the spc to reflect the new 
 indication.</p><p>
 in support of the indication results of two clinical trials have been submitted (study hmr1964d/3001 
 and hmr1964a/1017).</p></section><section><header n="2">2 clinical aspects</header></section><section><header n="2.1">2.1 clinical efficacy</header><p>the clinical documentation consists of two clinical studies:</p></section><section><header>study hmr1964d/3001</header><p> that investigated the efficacy and safety of insulin glulisine compared with insulin lispro in children and adolescents with type i diabetes mellitus: a 26-week, multicentre, open,

 subjects with type 1 diabetes in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, two-way crossover study.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.1">2.1.1 study hmr1964d/3001</header><p>this study was a multicentre, multinational, open, parallel-group, controlled, 1:1 randomised study with a run-in phase of 4 weeks, and a treatment phase of 26 weeks with a total of 572 male and female 
 patients with type 1 diabetes (aged 4 to 17 years), carried out between 12 april 2005 and 03 
 november 2006.</p><p>
 the mah stated that “according to article 8.3 (ib) of directive 2001/83/ec, as amended, the 
 applicant confirms that clinical trials carried out outside the european union met ethical requirements 
 of the declaration of helsinki and good clinical practice, applicable national laws and regulations and 
 the ethical principles of directive 2001/20/ec.”</p></section><section><header n="2.1.1.1">2.1.1.1 study design</header><p>study hmr1964d/3001 was a multicentre, multinational, open-label, controlled, centrally randomised (1:1), stratified, parallel-group study in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 
 between 4 and 17 years. the study consisted, after a screening period of about 1 week, of a run-in 
 phase of 4 weeks followed by a 26-week treatment phase, and by a 24-hour follow-up period.</p><p>3</p></section><section><header>study design</header><p>subjects were stratified within each centre according to whether they were taking nph or insulin glargine as basal insulin at the time of randomisation. during the study, insulin glulisine or insulin 
 lispro was given at least twice daily within 15 minutes prior to a meal in combination with nph 
 insulin administered twice daily or insulin glargine administered once daily in the evening. total study 
 duration was approximately 31 weeks. male and female patients aged 4-17 years with established type 
 1 diabetes mellitus with an onset of at least one year prior to screening, an uninterrupted insulin 
 therapy for at least one year on a stable insulin regimen consisting of either nph or insulin glargine as 
 the basal insulin, willing to have multiple daily injections of insulin, with a glycated haemoglobin 
 (hba1c) value in the range of ≥ 6.0 and ≤11.0%, able and willing to perform blood glucose (bg) 
 monitoring, were eligible to participate in the study.</p><p>
 a total of 646 subjects were screened, 572 randomised with 276 subjects randomised into the glulisine 
 group and 295 randomised into the lispro group. of these, a total of 265 subjects completed the study 
 with glulisine and 287 subjects completed with lispro. one subject randomised in the insulin lispro 
 group</p><p>was treated by error in the insulin glulisine group; he was therefore considered in the insulin 
 glulisine group for all analyses and excluded from the pp population. thus, 277 subjects were treated 
 in the insulin glulisine group and 295 in the insulin lispro group.</p><p>
 the primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of insulin glulisine compared to insulin 
 lispro in the change in total glycated haemoglobin (ghb) from baseline to endpoint (week 26 or last 
 observation on treatment) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>
 secondary objectives were to compare insulin glulisine with insulin lispro in terms of secondary 
 efficacy parameters (change in ghb at week 12 and week 26, self-monitored blood glucose [smbg] 
 parameters, symptomatic hypoglycaemia and insulin doses) and safety (adverse events [aes], serious 
 symptomatic hypoglycaemia, clinical chemistry and haematology, as well as insulin antibodies), in 
 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>
 overall, the mean age of subjects was 12.5 years. approximately 7 % of subjects were &lt;8 years (1.6% 
 &lt;6 years), 26% were between 8 and 12 years old, and 67% were above 12 years. overall, the mean 
 bmi was 20.6 kg/m².</p><p> 4</p></section><section><header>subject demographics</header></section><section><header>treatments</header><p>insulin glulisine (3ml cartridges and 10ml vials), individual titration based on the bg values. subjects were administered a subcutaneous injection between 0 to 15 minutes prior to a meal, at least

 previously, and analysis of the study are in accordance with the european guidelines.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.1.2">2.1.1.2 results  
 primary efficacy variable analysis</header><p>the primary efficacy analysis was the change in ghb from baseline to endpoint using the mitt population, where endpoint was defined as the subject’s last available measurement during the 
 treatment phase. the pp population was analysed to check for the consistency of the results with the 
 mitt population.</p></section><section><header>ghb (%): change from baseline at endpoint (mitt and pp populations)</header><p> 6the results appear to support the non-inferiority conclusion of insulin glulisine compared to insulin lispro. nevertheless, chmp initially had some concern over the effect on the analysis of the algorithm 
 used for pooling small centres and whether the analysis was affected by empty strata within centres. 
 the concern was in particular related to the fact that the results might be biased in favour of apidra 
 due to the chosen method of handling small centres.</p><p>
 in their responses to this concern the mah provided a number of analyses of the primary variable that 
 indicated that the upper limit of the 95% cis for the difference in adjusted means for change from 
 baseline at endpoint in hba1c are well below the non-inferiority limit of 0,4%. these results were 
 consistent with the primary efficacy analysis and with previous results of sensitivity analyses. the 
 mah therefore concluded that the strategy of pooling centres did not induce any bias in favour of 
 apidra. the chmp agreed with the mah conclusions.</p></section><section><header>secondary efficacy variable analysis</header><p>there were no changes from baseline in ghb at week 12 and a minimal increase in ghb in both groups at week 26 (+0.08% in the insulin glulisine group, +0.17% in the insulin lispro group).</p><p>
 the change from baseline at each time-point in the two treatment groups was similar to the change 
 observed for the primary analysis at endpoint. the 95% cis of the between-treatment difference are 
 consistent with the conclusion of non-inferiority as defined for the primary efficacy variable.</p></section><section><header>ghb (%): change from baseline at weeks 12 and 26 – mitt population</header></section><section><header>proportion of subjects reaching different pre-specified ghb thresholds</header><p>the proportion of subjects reaching two different pre-specified ghb thresholds: ghb &lt;8.5%, and decrease in ghb from baseline ≥0.7% are displayed below.</p></section><section><header>number of subjects reaching ghb categories (mitt population)</header><p> 7there was a greater percentage of adolescents (13 to 17 years) in the insulin glulisine group reaching a ghb level &lt;7.5% (31.1% versus 21.1%). globally, the number of subjects reaching their respective 
 ghb goals according to their age category was significantly higher in the insulin glulisine group 
 (38.4% versus 32.0%, p=0.0386).</p></section><section><header>number (%) of subjects reaching ghb age-categories (mitt population)</header></section><section><header>insulin doses</header><p>the mean daily insulin doses are shown below.</p></section><section><header>mean daily insulin dose (in u) during the treatment phase (mitt population)</header><p> 8post-prandial glycaemic control, as assessed by self-monitored blood glucose (smbg) values and bg excursions, was similar in the two treatment groups at endpoint, with no statistically significant 
 difference between the treatment groups. at endpoint, subjects treated with insulin lispro required 
 significantly greater increases from baseline in basal, rapid-acting and total insulin daily doses in order 
 to achieve similar glycaemic control than subjects treated with insulin glulisine.</p><p>
 there were no noteworthy differences between the two treatment groups in the incidence of all 
 symptomatic hypoglycaemia, severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia, and severe nocturnal symptomatic 
 hypoglycaemia. the incidence of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher in the insulin 
 glulisine group than the insulin lispro group in the time period “entire treatment phase”; this between-
 group difference was mainly observed in the first month of treatment and decreased in the latter part of 
 the treatment phase.</p></section><section><header>number (percentage) of subjects with all symptomatic hypoglycaemia (safety population)

 however, only 22 and 19 patients under the age of 8 years old had been randomised to insulin 
 glulisine and lispro, respectively. the chmp therefore considered that the analysis of the subgroup of 
 younger patients did not provide reliable evidence for the consistency of the results in patients at the 
 lower end of the range studied.</p><p>
 in their response to this concern the mah proposed to lower this age limit to 6 years instead of 8 
 years, arguing that in the age category ≥6 and &lt; 8 years the number of subjects studied was 32 (18 in 
 the glulisine group and 14 in the lispro group). although relatively low, this number corresponds to 
 6.5% of the population exposed in the glulisine group and is consistent with the current epidemiologic 
 data available for this age category. the mah argued that it seems possible to extrapolate the data 
 observed for the population over 8 years exposed in the study to the particular age category ≥6 and &lt; 8 
 years. the mah also put forward that according to general experience in insulin therapy, there is no 
 medical rationale supporting a difference in efficacy when considering the paediatric population below 
 or above the age of 8 years.</p><p>
 the chmp acknowledged the mah arguments and agreed to an indication in the age group 6 to 17 
 years of age. however, since experience in the younger children is regarded as limited while the 
 incidence of serious hypoglycaemia was somewhat higher in the younger subgroups of the trial, the 
 mah was requested to undertake certain activities as defined in the rmp (section 2.4) and in the list

 above with diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required.</p><p> 
 the data provided for children below 6 years of age were regarded by the chmp as too limited but it 
 was considered acceptable to extrapolate the results observed in the study population over 8 years to 
 the subgroup of children aged between 6 and 8 years.</p><p>
 the chmp was therefore of the opinion that the benefit-risk is positive for the treatment of diabetes 
 mellitus in the adolescents and children from the age of 6 years. however, in order to gain further 
 knowledge in the younger patients the mah is to undertake certain activities as defined in the rmp 
 (section 2.4) and in the list of follow-up measures. in particular the mah is to submit 6 monthly 
 psurs until the renewal of the marketing authorisation.</p></section></body></xml>
