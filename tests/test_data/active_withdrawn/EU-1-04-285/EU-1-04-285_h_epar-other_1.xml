 • to observe the monthly rate of hypoglycaemia events per patient reported from the baseline to the end of the study.</p></section><section><header>study design</header><p>this was a national, multi-centre, non-comparative, open-label, prospective phase iv study, conducted between 17 may 2011 (date first patient enrolled) and 18 october 2012 (date last 
 patient completed the study). the study was conducted in 8 centres in russia. 
 the total duration of study participation for each patient was approximately 12 months, including 
 the following 2 periods: 
 • a screening period of 1-2 weeks 
 • a treatment observation period of 12 months.</p></section><section><header>study population /sample size</header><p>number of subjects originally 210 subjects were planned for enrolment in the study. however, samples of insulin glulisine were provided to patients during the study and during the study it became apparent that 
 insulin glulisine was not included in the federal reimbursement list as it was expected before the 
 study start. 
 in russia all patients with t1 diabetes have status of invalids and receive insulin free of charge mostly through the federal reimbursement list. therefore, it was a common decision of 
 the team (medical, csu) to limit the number of patients up to 100 to avoid further switching to 
 another insulin after the study end and focus on enrolment only in regions where patients were 
 capable to receive insulin glulisine after the study end. this study adjustment was approved by 
 independent national ethical committee 
 diagnosis and criteria for inclusion children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, with t1dm of duration of more than 1 year and inadequate glycaemic control (8% ≤ hba1c ≤ 10%) were enrolled in the present study. patients 
 were treated, before the start of the study, with insulin glargine and any short acting insulin as a 
 basal-bolus regimen; they were able to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (smbg) as 
 requested by the study protocol; and they had a signed consent form.</p></section><section><header>treatments</header><p>investigational medicinal products: insulin glulisine: apidra (100 u/ml) in a cartridge containing 3 ml for the reusable insulin pen opticlick

 dose regimen: patients were treated with insulin glargine and insulin glulisine in basal-bolus regimen. insulin glargine: continued titration according to recommendations of treatment children and 
 adolescents. the administration of insulin glargine was done once daily through a subcutaneous 
 injection. the dose of insulin glargine was individually adjusted. 
 insulin glulisine: the initial dose of insulin glulisine was selected individually. physicians were 
 advised to use the calculation based on carbohydrate counting. the administration of insulin 
 glargine was done before meal (0-15) minutes, or within 20 minutes after a meal start. dose was 
 titrated in accordance with the algorithm to achieve the following targets: 
 plasma glucose levels before meals: 
 children 6-12 years including 5-10 mmol / l; 
 children 13-17 years old 5-7,3 mmol / l; 
 plasma glucose levels at bedtime / night: 
 children 6-12 years including 5,6-10 mmol/ l; 
 children 13-17 years old 5-8,4 mmol / l; 
 assessment of the treatment regimen compliance</p><p>the treating physician analysed the detailed information about the precise dose and the time to administrate insulin on days when the glycaemic profile was conducted. this information was 
 inserted in the patient’s self-control diary. 
 dose titration was based on the results of the patient’ own monitoring of glucose level. for this 
 purpose patients used glucose meters to define the plasma glucose. the latter were provided by 
 the sponsor at the beginning of the study. 
 no extra assessment of the treatment regimen compliance was conducted.</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints efficacy</header><p>primary endpoint • the proportions of patients who achieved hba1c level &lt; 8% in children aged 6-12 years old, and &lt; 7.5 % in adolescents aged 13-17 years old, at 6 and 12 months of treatment.

 hypoglycaemic events were categorised based on the following definitions: • symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as event with typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia following blood glucose change ≤ 3.9 mmol/l 
 • nocturnal hypoglycaemia was defined as event, which happened during the sleep time (after falling asleep or before wakeup) 
 • severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event with clinical symptoms that are considered to result from hypoglycaemia, requiring the assistance of another person for active 
 administration of carbohydrate, glucagon or other countermeasure because the patient 
 could not treat her/himself.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>the study was aimed to observe the proportions of patients who achieved hba1c target during the study period. it did not test any specific hypothesis.

 discussion on clinical aspect</header><p>this was an open-label, stand-alone study with no comparator arm in inadequately controlled children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. originally it was planned to enrol 210 subjects in 
 the study. however, during the study it became apparent that insulin glulisine was not included in 
 the federal reimbursement list. therefore, a decision was made to limit the number of patients up 
 to 100 to avoid subjects having to switch to another insulin after the study end and focus on 
 enrolment only in regions where patients were capable to receive insulin glulisine after the study 
 end.</p><p>
 there are a number of limitations to this study, including the open-label non-comparator design, 
 the number of patients enrolled and the lack of details on the reasons for subjects having poor 
 glycaemic control prior to inclusion in the study – for example whether this was due to previous 
 poor compliance. 
 however, notwithstanding above, the improvements seen in hba1c levels seen in children aged 6-
 12 years and 13-17 years are generally in-keeping with those seen in the previous pivotal clinical 
 trial in children and adolescents. 
 there were no deaths during the study. the number of serious adverse events and serious 
 hypoglycaemic events was low. the percentage and event rate for hypoglycaemia is within that 
 seen previously. no new safety signals were identified in this trial.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.
