 azopt is a white to off-white suspension.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical particulars</header></section><section><header n="4.1">4.1 therapeutic indications</header><p>azopt is indicated to decrease elevated intraocular pressure in: • ocular hypertension</p><p>• open-angle glaucoma as monotherapy in patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in patients in whom beta-blockers are 
 contra-indicated, or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>when used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the dose is one drop of azopt in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) twice daily. some patients may have a better response with one drop 
 three times a day.</p><p>
 nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation is recommended. this may reduce 
 the systemic absorption of medications administered via the ocular route and result in a decrease in 
 systemic side effects.</p><p>
 when substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with azopt, discontinue the other agent 
 and start the following day with azopt. 
 if more than one topical ophthalmic medication is being used, the medicines must be administered at 
 least 5 minutes apart.</p><p>
 shake well before use. to prevent contamination of the dropper tip and suspension, care must be taken 
 not to touch the eyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. keep the 
 bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><p>
 use in elderly</p><p>
 no dosage alteration in elderly patients is necessary.</p><p>
 use in children</p><p>
 the efficacy and safety of azopt in patients below the age of 18 have not been established and its 
 use is not recommended in these patients.</p><p>
 use in hepatic and renal impairment 
 azopt has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended in 
 such patients.</p><p>
 3 azopt has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis. since brinzolamide and its main metabolite 
 are excreted predominantly by the kidney, azopt is therefore contra-indicated in such patients (see 
 also 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contra-indications</header><p>• hypersensitivity to brinzolamide or any of the excipients.</p><p>• known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see also 4.4). • severe renal impairment. • hyperchloraemic acidosis (see also 4.2).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>azopt is a sulphonamide and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. therefore, the same types of undesirable effects that are attributable to sulphonamides may occur with topical 
 administration. if signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this 
 preparation.</p><p>
 there is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase 
 inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and azopt. the concomitant 
 administration of azopt and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not 
 recommended.</p><p>
 there is limited experience with azopt in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma 
 or pigmentary glaucoma.</p><p>
 azopt was primarily evaluated in concomitant administration with timolol during adjunctive 
 glaucoma therapy. therefore, there are limited data regarding the administration of brinzolamide with 
 other antiglaucomatous agents.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 the possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients 
 with compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count). specifically, 
 patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when 
 using brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration 
 and wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea. likewise, in other cases of 
 compromised corneas such as patients with diabetes mellitus, careful monitoring is recommended.</p><p>
 benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been 
 reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. since azopt contains 
 benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye 
 patients, or in conditions where the cornea is compromised.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. azopt contains the preservative 
 benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation.</p><p>benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by 
 soft contact lenses and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. therefore, patients must be instructed 
 to wait 15 minutes after instillation of azopt before inserting contact lenses. azopt must not be 
 administered while wearing contact lenses.</p><p>
 potential rebound effects following cessation of treatment with azopt have not been studied; the 
 iop-lowering effect is expected to last for 5-7 days.</p><p>
 oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness 
 and/or physical coordination in elderly patients. azopt is absorbed systemically and therefore this 
 may occur with topical administration. 
 4</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>specific interaction studies with other medicinal products have not been performed with azopt. in clinical studies, azopt was used concomitantly with timolol ophthalmic preparations without 
 evidence of adverse interactions. association between azopt and miotics or adrenergic agonists has 
 not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.</p><p>
 association between azopt and antiglaucomatous agents other than beta-adrenergic blocking agents 
 has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.</p><p>
 azopt is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed 
 systemically. acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. the 
 potential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving azopt.</p><p>
 the cytochrome p-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include cyp3a4 (main), 
 cyp2a6, cyp2c8 and cyp2c9. it is expected that inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ketoconazole, 
 itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide 
 by cyp3a4. caution is advised if cyp3a4 inhibitors are given concomitantly. however, 
 accumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. brinzolamide is not 
 an inhibitor of cytochrome p-450 isozymes.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data from the use of brinzolamide in pregnant women. studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see 5.3). the potential risk for humans is unknown. azopt should not 
 be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.</p><p>
 nursing mothers 
 it is not known whether brinzolamide is excreted in human milk, however, this substance is excreted 
 in rat milk. it is strongly recommended to avoid the use of azopt when breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances, may affect the ability to drive or use machines (see also 4.8 undesirable effects). if blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the 
 vision clears before driving or using machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>in clinical studies involving over 1500 patients treated with azopt as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 0.5%, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were: 
 dysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste, see description below) (5.3%) and temporary blurred vision upon 
 instillation, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes (4.8%) (see also 4.7 effects on ability to drive 
 and use machines).</p><p>
 the following undesirable effects definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment were reported 
 during the clinical trials with azopt.</p><p>their incidence was either common (1.0% to less than 10.0%; 
 maximum observed actual incidence of 5.3%) or uncommon (0.1% to less than 1.0%).</p><p>
 infections and infestations 
 uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%):</p><p>bronchitis and pharyngitis.</p><p>

 eye disorders 
 common (≥ 1% to &lt; 10%):</p><p>abnormal sensation in eye, eye irritation, ocular hyperaemia and vision blurred.</p><p>uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%):</p><p>asthenopia, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, corneal erosion, deposit eye, eye discharge, eye pain, eye pruritis, eyelid margin crusting, eyelids pruritus, 
 keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, keratopathy, lacrimation increased, ocular discomfort, photopsia 
 and punctate keratitis.</p><p>
 respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders 
 uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%): cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, respiratory tract 
 congestion, rhinorrhoea, sinus disorder and throat irritation.</p><p>
 gastrointestinal disorders 
 uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%):</p><p>dry mouth, dyspepsia, mouth haemorrhage and nausea.</p><p>
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
 uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%):</p><p>alopecia, dermatitis contact and rash.</p><p>
 general disorders and administration site conditions 
 uncommon (≥ 0.1% to &lt; 1%):</p><p>chest pain.</p><p>
 dysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) was the most frequently reported 
 systemic undesirable effect associated with the use of azopt during clinical studies.</p><p>it is likely 
 caused by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal.</p><p>nasolacrimal 
 occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reducing the incidence of this effect 
 (see also 4.2 posology and method of administration).</p><p>
 azopt is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption.</p><p> 
 gastrointestinal, nervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are generally associated 
 with systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</p><p>the same type of undesirable effects that are attributable 
 to oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>no case of overdose has been reported.</p><p>
 treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic 
 state, and possible nervous system effects may occur. serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) 
 and blood ph levels must be monitored.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</p><p>

 6 carbonic anhydrase (ca) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye. carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the 
 dehydration of carbonic acid.</p><p>
 inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour 
 secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in 
 sodium and fluid transport. the result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (iop) which is a major risk 
 factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. brinzolamide, an 
 inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase ii (ca-ii), the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye, with an 
 in vitro ic50 of 3.2 nm and a ki of 0.13 nm against ca-ii.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. due to its high affinity for ca-ii, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the rbcs and exhibits a long half-
 life in whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks). in humans, the metabolite n-desethyl-
 brinzolamide is formed, which also binds to ca and accumulates in rbcs. this metabolite binds 
 mainly to ca-i in the presence of brinzolamide.</p><p>in plasma, both brinzolamide and n-desethyl-
 brinzolamide concentrations are low and generally below assay quantitation limits (&lt;7.5 ng/ml). 
 binding to plasma proteins is not extensive (about 60%). brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by 
 renal excretion (approximately 60%). about 20% of the dose has been accounted for in urine as 
 metabolite. brinzolamide and n-desethyl-brinzolamide are the predominant components in the urine 
 along with trace levels of the n-desmethoxypropyl and o-desmethyl metabolites.</p><p>
 in an oral pharmacokinetic study, healthy volunteers received 1-mg capsules of brinzolamide twice 
 daily for up to 32 weeks and rbc ca activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic ca 
 inhibition.</p><p>
 brinzolamide saturation of rbc ca-ii was achieved within 4 weeks (rbc concentrations of 
 approximately 20 µm). n-desethyl-brinzolamide accumulated in rbcs to steady state within</p><p>
 20-28 weeks reaching concentrations ranging from 6-30 µm. the inhibition of total rbc ca activity 
 at steady state was approximately 70-75%.</p><p>
 subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/minute) were administered 
 1 mg of brinzolamide twice daily orally for up to 54 weeks. brinzolamide rbc concentration ranged 
 from about 20 to 40 
 μm by week 4 of treatment. at steady-state, brinzolamide and its metabolite rbc concentrations ranged from 22.0 to 46.1 and 17.1 to 88.6 
 μm, respectively.</p><p> 
 n-desethyl-brinzolamide rbc concentrations increased and total rbc ca activity decreased with 
 decreasing creatinine clearance but brinzolamide rbc concentrations and ca-ii activity remained 
 unchanged. in subjects with the highest degree of renal impairment inhibition of total ca activity was 
 greater although it was inferior to 90% at steady-state.</p><p>
 in a topical ocular study, at steady-state, brinzolamide rbc concentrations were similar to those found 
 in the oral study, but levels of n-desethyl-brinzolamide were lower. carbonic anhydrase activity was 
 approximately 40-70% of predose levels.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>topical ocular administration of brinzolamide to rabbits for one to six months resulted in slight, statistically significant increases in corneal thickness when given at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4%, 
 four times a day; these changes were not observed in other species. chronic administration of 
 brinzolamide to rats at a dose level of 8 mg/kg/day (up to 250 times the recommended human 
 ophthalmic dose) resulted in changes associated with the pharmacology of carbonic anhydrase 
 inhibition (i.e., urine volume and electrolyte changes, slight differences in serum electrolytes).</p><p>
 7 a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours was observed in female mice given brinzolamide 10 mg/kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose), orally, for 
 24 months.</p><p>
 dose-related proliferative changes in the urinary bladder were observed among female mice at 
 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, and among males at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. the elevated bladder tumour 
 incidence, which was statistically significant, was primarily due to the increased incidence of a tumour 
 considered unique to mice.</p><p>
 developmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day 
 (125 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed no effect on foetal development 
 despite significant maternal toxicity. similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of 
 skull and sternebrae of foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg/kg/day (375 times 
 the recommended human ophthalmic dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day. these findings occurred at doses that 
 caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights. 
 dose-related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally 
 ranging from a slight decrease (about 5-6%) at 2 mg/kg/day to nearly 14% at 18 mg/kg/day.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>benzalkonium chloride, mannitol,

 azopt eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye.</header><p> this pressure can lead to an illness called</p></section><section><header>glaucoma.  high pressure in the eye.</header><p>your eyeballs contain a clear, watery liquid which feeds the inside of the eye. liquid is always emptying out of the eye, and more liquid is always being produced. if the eye 
 fills up faster than it empties, the pressure inside the eye builds up. if it gets too high it can damage 
 your sight.</p></section><section><header>azopt is one of a group of medicines</header><p>for glaucoma called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. it works by cutting down the production of liquid, which lowers the pressure in the eye. it may be used on its 
 own or with other drops called beta-blockers, which also reduce pressure.</p><p>
