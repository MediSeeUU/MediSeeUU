  results from the study show that in children not previously 
 treated, the efficacy of azopt is similar to the one in adults. 
 however, in children who received prior treatment with 
 intra ocular pressure (iop) lowering medication, the mean 
 iop changes from baseline did not decrease, and in fact a
