 page 2/2</header></section><section><header>scientific conclusions</header><p>taking into account the prac assessment report on the psur(s) for brinzolamide, the scientific conclusions of chmp are as follows: 
 in view of available data on stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) 
 from spontaneous reports including several cases highly suggestive of causal association with 
 brinzolamide, and the fact that topical brinzolamide is absorbed systemically, and therefore, the same 
 types of adrs (including sjs and ten) associated with sulphonamides may occur with topical 
 administration, the prac rapporteur considers a causal relationship between brinzolamide and 
 sjs/ten is at least a reasonable possibility. therefore, an update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the smpc 
 to add the adr sjs/ten with a frequency ‘not known’ and a warning on sjs/ten is considered 
 warranted. the package leaflet should be updated accordingly.</p><p>
 the chmp agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the prac.</p></section><section><header>grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)</header><p>on the basis of the scientific conclusions for brinzolamide the chmp is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brinzolamide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
 changes to the product information 
 the chmp recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.</p></section></body></xml>
