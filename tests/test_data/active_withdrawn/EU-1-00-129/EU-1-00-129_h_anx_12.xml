 ocular hypertension 
 • 
 open-angle glaucoma 
 as monotherapy in adult patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in adult patients in whom beta-blockers 
 are contraindicated, or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues (see also 
 section 5.1).</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>posology when used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the dose is one drop of azopt in the conjunctival sac 
 of the affected eye(s) twice daily. some patients may have a better response with one drop three times a 
 day.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>elderly population no dose adjustment in elderly patients is necessary.</p><p>
 hepatic and renal impairment 
 azopt has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended in 
 such patients.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) 
 or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis. since brinzolamide and its main metabolite are excreted 
 predominantly by the kidney, azopt is therefore contra-indicated in such patients (see also section 4.3).</p><p>
 paediatric population the safety and efficacy of azopt in infants, children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years has not been established.</p><p>currently available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1.</p><p>azopt is not recommended 
 for use in infants, children and adolescents.</p><p>
 method of administration 
 for ocular use.</p><p>
 nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation is recommended. this may reduce the 
 systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a decrease in 
 systemic side effects.</p><p>
 instruct the patient to shake the bottle well before use. after the cap is removed, if tamper evident snap 
 collar is loose, remove before using the product.</p><p>
 to prevent contamination of the dropper tip and suspension, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, 
 surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. instruct patients to keep the bottle 
 tightly closed when not in use.</p><p>
 when substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with azopt, discontinue the other agent and 
 start the following day with azopt.</p><p>
 if more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicines must be administered 
 at least 5 minutes apart. eye ointments should be administered last.</p><p>
 if a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. the dose should not 
 exceed one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contra-indications</header><p> hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see also section 4.4).  severe renal impairment.  hyperchloraemic acidosis.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>systemic effects azopt is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase and, although administered topically, is 
 absorbed systemically. the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulphonamides may 
 occur with topical administration. if signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the 
 use of this preparation.</p><p>
 acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. use with caution in 
 patients with risk of renal impairment because the possible risk of metabolic acidosis (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 brinzolamide has not been studied in pre-term infants (less than 36 weeks gestational age) or those less 
 than 1 week of age. patients with significant renal tubular immaturity or abnormalities should only receive 
 brinzolamide after careful consideration of the risk benefit balance because of the possible risk of 
 metabolic acidosis.</p><p>
 oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical coordination. azopt is absorbed systemically and therefore this may occur with topical 
 administration.</p><p>
 concomitant therapy 
 there is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition 
 in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and azopt. the concomitant administration of 
 azopt and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not recommended (see also 
 section 4.5).</p><p>
 azopt was primarily evaluated in concomitant administration with timolol during adjunctive glaucoma 
 therapy. additionally the iop-reducing effect of azopt as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin 
 analogue travoprost has been studied. no long term data are available on the use of azopt as adjunctive 
 therapy to travoprost(see also section 5.1).</p><p>
 there is limited experience with azopt in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or 
 pigmentary glaucoma. caution should be used in treating these patients and close monitoring of 
 intraocular pressure (iop) is recommended. azopt has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle 
 glaucoma and its use is not recommended in these patients.</p><p>
 the possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients 
 with compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count). specifically, patients 
 wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when using 
 brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration and 
 wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea. careful monitoring of patients with 
 compromised corneas such as patients with diabetes mellitus or corneal dystrophies is recommended.</p><p>
 benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been 
 reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. since azopt contains 
 benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients, or 
 in conditions where the cornea is compromised.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. azopt contains benzalkonium chloride 
 which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. contact with soft contact 
 lenses is to be avoided. patients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the application of 
 azopt and wait at least 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion.</p><p>
 potential rebound effects following cessation of treatment with azopt have not been studied; the iop-
 lowering effect is expected to last for 5-7 days.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 the safety and efficacy of azopt in infants, children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years has not been 
 established and its use is not recommended in infants, children or adolescents</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>specific interaction studies with other medicinal products have not been performed with azopt.</p><p> 
 in clinical studies, azopt was used concomitantly with prostaglandin analogues and timolol ophthalmic 
 preparations without evidence of adverse interactions. association between azopt and miotics or 
 adrenergic agonists has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.</p><p>
 azopt is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. the potential for 
 interactions must be considered in patients receiving azopt.</p><p>
 the cytochrome p-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include cyp3a4 (main), 
 cyp2a6, cyp2c8 and cyp2c9. it is expected that inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ketoconazole, 
 itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide by 
 cyp3a4. caution is advised if cyp3a4 inhibitors are given concomitantly. however, accumulation of 
 brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of 
 cytochrome p-450 isozymes.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no or limited amount of data from the use of ophthalmic brinzolamide in pregnant women. 
 studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see also section 
 5.3).</p><p>
 azopt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
 contraception.</p><p>
 breast-feeding 
 it is unknown whether brinzolamide/metabolites are excreted in human milk following topical ocular 
 administration. animal studies have shown the excretion of minimal levels of brinzolamide in breast milk 
 following oral administration.</p><p>
 a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.</p><p>a decision must be made whether to discontinue 
 breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from azopt therapy taking in to account the benefit of breast-
 feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.</p><p>
 fertility 
 animal studies with brinzolamide demonstrated no effect on fertility. studies have not been performed to 
 evaluate the effect of topical ocular administration of brinzolamide on human fertility.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>azopt has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p><p>
 temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines (see 
 also section 4.8). if blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before 
 driving or using machines.</p><p>

 description of selected adverse events 
 dysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) was the most frequently reported 
 systemic adverse reaction associated with the use of azopt during clinical studies. it is likely caused by 
 passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal. nasolacrimal occlusion or gently 
 closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the incidence of this effect (see also section 4.2).</p><p>
 azopt is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption. gastrointestinal, 
 nervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are generally associated with systemic 
 carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. the same type of adverse reactions that are attributable to oral carbonic 
 anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration.</p><p>
 no unexpected adverse reactions have been observed with azopt when used as adjunctive therapy to 
 travoprost. the adverse reactions seen with the adjunctive therapy have been observed with each active 
 substance alone.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 in small short-term clinical trials, approximately 12.5% of paediatric patients were observed to experience 
 adverse reactions, the majority of which were local, non-serious ocular reactions such as conjunctival 
 hyperaemia, eye irritation, eye discharge, and lacrimation increased (see also section 5.1).</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.</p><p>it allows 
 continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.</p><p>healthcare professionals are 
 asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 
 appendix v
 .</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>no case of overdose has been reported.</p><p>
 treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, 
 and possible nervous system effects may occur. serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and 
 blood ph levels must be monitored.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, atc code: s01ec04</p><p>
 mechanism of action 
 carbonic anhydrase (ca) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye. carbonic 
 anhydrase catalyses the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration 
 of carbonic acid.</p><p>
 inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour secretion, 
 presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid 
 transport. the result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (iop) which is a major risk factor in the 
 pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. brinzolamide, an inhibitor of 
 carbonic anhydrase ii (ca-ii), the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye, with an 
 in vitro ic50 of 3.2 nm and a k
 i of 0.13 nm against ca-ii.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety 
 the iop-reducing effect of azopt as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin analogue travoprost was 
 studied. following a 4 week run-in with travoprost, patients with an iop ≥19 mmhg were randomized to 
 receive added treatment with brinzolamide or timolol. an additional decrease in mean diurnal iop of 
 3.2 to 3.4 mmhg for the brinzolamide group and 3.2 to 4.2 mmhg for the timolol group were observed. 
 there was an overall higher incidence of non-serious ocular adverse reactions, mainly related to signs of 
 local irritation, in the brinzolamide/travoprost groups. the events were mild and did not affect the overall 
 discontinuation rates in the studies (see also section 4.8).</p><p>
 a clinical trial was conducted with azopt in 32 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age, diagnosed 
 with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. some patients were naive to iop therapy whilst others were on 
 other iop-lowering medicinal product(s). those who had been on previous iop medicinal product(s) were 
 not required to discontinue their iop medicinal product(s) until initiation of monotherapy with azopt.</p><p>
 among patients who were naive to iop therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of azopt was similar to that 
 seen previously in adults, with mean iop reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmhg. among 
 patients who were on topical iop-lowering medicinal product(s) (22 patients), mean iop increased 
 slightly from baseline in the azopt group.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. due to its high affinity for ca-ii, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the red blood cells (rbcs) and exhibits a 
 long half-life in whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks). in humans, the metabolite n-
 desethylbrinzolamide is formed, which also binds to ca and accumulates in rbcs. this metabolite binds 
 mainly to ca-i in the presence of brinzolamide. in plasma, both brinzolamide and n-
 desethylbrinzolamide concentrations are low and generally below assay quantitation limits (&lt;7.5 ng/ml).</p><p>
 binding to plasma proteins is not extensive (about 60%). brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal 
 excretion (approximately 60%). about 20% of the dose has been accounted for in urine as metabolite. 
 brinzolamide and n-desethylbrinzolamide are the predominant components in the urine along with trace 
 levels (&lt;1%) of the n-desmethoxypropyl and o-desmethyl metabolites.</p><p>in an oral pharmacokinetic study, healthy volunteers received 1 mg capsules of brinzolamide twice daily for up to 32 weeks and rbc ca activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic ca inhibition.</p><p>
 brinzolamide saturation of rbc ca-ii was achieved within 4 weeks (rbc concentrations of 
 approximately 20 µm). n-desethylbrinzolamide accumulated in rbcs to steady state within 20-28 weeks 
 reaching concentrations ranging from 6-30 µm. the inhibition of total rbc ca activity at steady state 
 was approximately 70-75%.</p><p>
 subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/minute) were administered 
 1 mg of brinzolamide twice daily orally for up to 54 weeks. brinzolamide rbc concentration ranged from 
 about 20 to 40 µm by week 4 of treatment. at steady-state, brinzolamide and its metabolite rbc 
 concentrations ranged from 22.0 to 46.1 and 17.1 to 88.6 µm, respectively.</p><p>
 n-desethylbrinzolamide rbc concentrations increased and total rbc ca activity decreased with 
 decreasing creatinine clearance but brinzolamide rbc concentrations and ca-ii activity remained 
 unchanged. in subjects with the highest degree of renal impairment inhibition of total ca activity was 
 greater although it was inferior to 90% at steady-state.</p><p>
 in a topical ocular study, at steady-state, brinzolamide rbc concentrations were similar to those found in 
 the oral study, but levels of n-desethylbrinzolamide were lower. carbonic anhydrase activity was 
 approximately 40-70% of predose levels.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.</p><p>
 developmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day (125 times 
 the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed no effect on foetal development despite significant 
 maternal toxicity. similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of skull and sternebrae of 
 foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg/kg/day (375 times the recommended human 
 ophthalmic dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day. these findings occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis 
 with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights. dose-related decreases in foetal 
 weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally ranging from a slight decrease 
 (about 5-6%) at 2 mg/kg/day to nearly 14% at 18 mg/kg/day. during lactation, the no adverse effect level 
 in the offspring was 5 mg/kg/day.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>benzalkonium chloride mannitol (e421)

 azopt may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical coordination. if 
 affected, take care when driving or using machines.</p></section><section><header>azopt contains benzalkonium chloride</header><p>azopt contains a preservative (benzalkonium chloride) which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. contact with soft contact lenses should be avoided. if you wear contact

 your doctor told you to.</p><p>take it for as long as your doctor told you to.</p></section><section><header>how to use</header><p>1 2 
 3</p><p>
  get the azopt bottle and a mirror  wash your hands  shake the bottle and twist off the cap.</p><p>after the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is</p><p> loose, remove before using product. 
  hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and middle finger  tilt your head back. pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your eye. the drop will go in here (picture 1) 
  bring the bottle tip close to the eye. use the mirror if it helps  do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. it could infect the drops 
  gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of azopt at a time.</p><p> do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs (picture 2) 
  after using azopt, press a finger to the corner of your eye, by the nose (picture 3) for at least 1 minute. this helps to stop azopt getting into the rest of the body. 
  if you take drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye.  put the bottle cap back on firmly immediately after use  use up one bottle before opening the next bottle.</p><p>
 if a drop misses your eye, try again.</p><p>
 if you are using other eye drops,</p><p>leave at least 5 minutes between putting in azopt and the other drops. 
 eye ointments should be administered last.</p></section><section><header>if you use more azopt than you should</header><p>if you get too much in your eyes, rinse it all out with warm water.</p><p>do not put in any more drops until it’s time for your next regular dose.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to use azopt</header><p>use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p></section><section><header>if you stop using azopt</header><p>if you stop using azopt without speaking to your doctor, the pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.</p><p>
