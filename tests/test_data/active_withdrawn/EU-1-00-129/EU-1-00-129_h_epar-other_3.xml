   scientific discussion 
 1. 
 introduction</header><p>azopt contains the new active ingredient brinzolamide, which was developed for ophthalmic use and is a topically effective inhibitor of ca-ii. it is intended to decrease elevated iop in ocular 
 hypertension and open-angle glaucoma, as monotherapy in patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or 
 in patients in whom beta-blockers are contra-indicated, or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. 
 when used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the dose is one drop of azopt in the conjunctival 
 sac of the affected eye(s) bid. 
 glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. it is a frequent disease and it has 
 been estimated that by the year 2000, 66.8 million people will be affected by it. glaucoma is an optic 
 neuropathy that leads to loss of optic-nerve tissue with an excavation of the ophthalmoscopically 
 visible optic nerve head and consequently, to a progressive loss of vision. elevated iop is a risk factor 
 for its development and reduction of iop has been demonstrated to protect against further damage to 
 the optic nerve. 
 up to 10% of people over the age of 40 years have an iop above 21 mmhg (normal range 10 to 21 
 mmhg); those who have such high pressures but no optic-nerve damage are considered to have ocular 
 hypertension. in medical practice, those patients who have ocular hypertension should be periodically 
 examined (optic nerve, visual field) to determine whether there is evidence of progressive damage 
 which would indicate the need to start with treatment. however, in some cases (e.g., additional risk 
 factors for glaucoma) a high iop may be treated even in the absence of optic nerve damage. 
 the current therapeutic approach is focused on lowering iop. pharmacological treatments are based 
 on the decrease of production of aqueous humor produced by the ciliary body but there is also the 
 possibility to increase its outflow by means of surgery or laser. the target pressure is that which is 
 thought to be safe to the optic nerve, taking into account the current amount of optic damage and the 
 pressure at which the damage occurred, but in principle, it should stay below 21 mmhg.</p><p>
 the medical treatment of glaucoma usually starts with a topical beta-blocker that permits a sufficient 
 decline in iop in most cases. if necessary (patients poorly controlled on beta-blockers or when beta-
 blockers are contra-indicated), either other topical drugs can be used or other topical or systemic drugs 
 have to be added to the patient’s regimen. laser procedures or filtering surgery are usually performed 
 after failure of medical treatment. 
 beta-blockers, and particularly timolol, which is the most popular product, have a high 
 pressure-lowering efficacy, long duration of action and a few ocular undesirable effects. however, the 
 systemic side effects of topical beta-blockers (bronchospasm and cardiac side effects) may limit their 
 use in special populations (e.g., patients suffering from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
 disease, bradycardia). 
 carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitors decrease the aqueous humor production by means of inhibiting 
 the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate at the ciliary body. in order to decrease iop through 
 that mechanism, more than 98% of the activity of the enzyme must be inhibited. oral cais such as 
 oral acetazolamide have been a classical treatment for glaucoma but are very poorly tolerated because 
 of systemic side effects. the first topical ca-ii inhibitor, dorzolamide, was approved for the treatment 
 of glaucoma or ocular hypertension when beta-blockers are contraindicated or as adjunctive therapy to 
 beta-blockers. side effects of dorzolamide are mainly local. most of the systemic side effects of oral 
 carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (cais) are not present with topical therapy because they are related to 
 the systemic inhibition of the ca present in many tissues. however, some of the severe side effects, 
 such as blood dyscrasias were not dose-related and therefore, attention should be paid to the 
 occurrence of such side effects.</p><p>2/25</p><p>

 brinzolamide is a new ca inhibitor, also selective for ca-ii, which is the predominant ocular isoenzyme. it has been developed only for topical use, and shows an efficacy and safety profile, which 
 is similar to that of dorzolamide. 
 also recently, two other products have received an approval in one or more eu member states for the 
 treatment of glaucoma, also as a second line therapy:</p><p>
 1) 
 latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue with the indication of reduction of elevated ocular 
 pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension intolerant or with 
 insufficient response to any other therapy.</p><p>
 2) 
 brimonidine, a new alpha
 2 agonist, in monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, who do not tolerate therapy with beta-blockers topically and/or patients in 
 which beta-blockers are contraindicated. in adjunctive therapy, it is used topically in addition to 
 a beta-blocker agent, when iop can not be controlled properly.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. part ii: chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>composition the product is formulated as a suspension in a purified water based vehicle. it contains benzalkonium 
 chloride as a preservative, edetate disodium as a preservative and chelating agent , sodium chloride 
 and mannitol as</p><p>tonicity agents, tyloxapol as a wetting agent and carbomer 974p as a suspending 
 agent. sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid are used for ph adjustment. azopt does not contain any 
 materials of animal or human origin or derivatives of such materials. such materials or derivatives are 
 not used in the manufacturing process either. the container is a natural low-density polyethylene 
 (ldpe) bottle. the container is equipped with a natural ldpe dispensing plug and a white 
 polypropylene closure.</p><p>
 active substance 
 brinzolamide is a new active substance, white to off-white crystals, and is not described in a 
 pharmacopoeia. the compound has a single chiral centre that has been established as having the r 
 configuration. it is produced by two manufacturers using a validated stereoselective process, which 
 proceeds in eight steps, including final purification, from commercially available starting materials.</p><p>
 the two manufacturers are amcis ag (bubendorf, switzerland) and sylachim, finorga division 
 (chasse sur rhône, france). during process development, the synthetic route for the active substance 
 was optimised by amcis. therefore, not all of the batches of brinzolamide described in this dossier 
 were prepared using the current commercial process. however, these modifications do not affect the 
 quality and the specifications of the active substance, and have no impact on safety and efficacy.</p><p>
 batches manufactured according to old procedures contained 9 impurities (a, b, c, d, f, g, h, s-
 isomer and ps4999) at more than 0.1%. also three non-identified impurities have been detected in 
 some of the batches at more than 0.1%. these impurities have not been detected in current batches at 
 more than 0.1%. 
 the number and percentage of impurities detected in batches manufactured according to the optimised 
 procedure has been reduced. only impurities a, g, f, h, s-isomer and ps 4999 have been detected. 
 none of the specified impurities have been detected as degradants in the finished product, except for 
 the (s)-isomer. 
 a second degradation product, the des-ethyl compound, is observed as an impurity in drug substance, 
 but only at concentrations less than 0.1%. this impurity will be controlled as an unspecified impurity 
 (&lt;0.1%) in the drug substance specification. 
 the routine controls and established specifications include description, identification (ir and chiral 
 hplc) and solution colour and clarity. 
 impurities are determined by hplc. the impurity limits in the specification are justified by 
 toxicology studies.</p><p>3/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 chiral purity is also determined by hplc (s-isomer ≤ 0.5%). the s-isomer is observed both as an impurity and a degradation product, and an additional toxicology study, n96-99, was done which 
 included the s-isomer at 20%. this study supports the proposed specification. 
 the solvent isopropyl alcohol has been detected in brinzolamide, which is used for the final 
 recrystallisation phase. the results obtained from the batches manufactured using the optimised 
 process support that there is no need to perform routine control of class 2 solvents used during the 
 manufacturing process. isopropyl alcohol, which is a class 3 solvent and relatively non-toxic, is tested 
 by the general method of loss on drying. 
 no metal catalysts are used in the procedure. however, the catalyst used contains boron, and several 
 of the reactants contain lithium. boron was detected in two batches (2 ppm), calcium was detected in 
 one batch (12 ppm), and lithium was not detected in any of the tested batches. the specifications for 
 heavy metals (20 ppm) and residue on ignition (
 ≤ 0.1%) are consistent with the quality produced and are acceptable considering the low dose of the product.</p><p>the assay is performed by hplc (98.0-101.0%, dried base), and a test for microbiologic quality</p><p>
 (
 ≤ 100 cfu/g) is included.</p><p>only one crystal form has been formed; however, this is not specifically controlled as brinzolamide 
 dissolves during the product manufacturing process (see further).</p><p>
 results of 19 batches have been presented (7 batches manufactured by amcis following the previous 
 procedure, 4 batches manufactured by amcis and 8 batches manufactured by finorga following the 
 optimised procedure). all batches manufactured according to the optimised procedure meet the 
 specifications. batches obtained following the previous procedure, present a higher level of impurities, 
 and do not meet specifications. 
 the results presented support the quality level established and confirm the consistency and uniformity 
 of the manufacturing process. 
 the active substance is stored in polyethylene bags in well-closed container. the analytical methods 
 used in the stability studies were similar to those used for the routine control of the raw material. 
 three-year long-term stability date and 6 months of accelerated stability data are available for active 
 substance synthesised by the previous amcis process. one batch from each of the two suppliers 
 using the optimised process was placed on an accelerated stability study to demonstrate equivalence to 
 the initial lots tested. additional studies according to ich conditions on three batches from each of the 
 suppliers have also been started to confirm the retest period. 
 a photostability study was performed prior to issuance of ich guideline and no significant 
 degradation products were observed.</p><p>
 on the basis of these data it can be concluded that brinzolamide is a stable drug substance and is not 
 photosensitive or hygroscopic. a retest period of two years is acceptable. 
 other ingredients 
 all the excipients used in the manufacture of the drug products are of european pharmacopoeia 
 (ph.eur.) quality, except tyloxapol, which is of us pharmacopoeia (usp) quality. certificates of 
 analysis of all excipients are presented, which are in accordance with the proposed specifications. 
 product development and finished product 
 the objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable, well-preserved 1% sterile 
 suspension dosage form.</p><p> 
 the enantiomeric form used in azopt is the r-isomer. a small amount of the s-isomer is formed 
 during autoclaving.</p><p>the amount is dependent on the time/temperature exposure of the solution. this 
 is controlled in the finished product at not more than 1.5% of the total brinzolamide, which is 
 toxicologically qualified. 
 the clinical trial formulations contained different percentages of the active ingredient ranging from 
 0% to 3%. a 5% excess of brinzolamide was added to all but one of the development batches in 
 anticipation of losses during manufacturing. this excess was found to be unnecessary for 
 manufacturing scale-up.</p><p>4/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 all clinical trial formulations contain an overage of 5% benzalkonium chloride, which has been removed from the proposed formulation intended for marketing. there were also differences with 
 regard to the carbomer (934 p vs. 974p) and the surfactant (polysorbate 80 vs. tyloxapol). 
 results showed that brinzolamide was soluble only to about 0.04 at physiologic ph and room 
 temperature. therefore a suspension dosage form was designed. however, at elevated temperatures 
 brinzolamide dissolves, but is recrystallised into large needle-like crystals (~ 200 µm) during cooling 
 and therefore it is not possible to terminally sterilise the product in the final container. 
 the main feature of the manufacturing process is the aseptic ball milling of a sterile (autoclaved) 
 slurry of brinzolamide. this is effected by zirconium alloy beads. only one polymorphic form of 
 brinzolamide has been observed and there are no polymorphic changes during manufacturing. 
 the manufacturing process is composed of five major steps: 
 1) 
 preparation of the milling slurry. transfer of the tyloxapol solution to milling bottles, addition 
 of beads and active ingredient, and steam sterilisation followed by aseptic milling; 
 2) 
 preparation of the vehicle concentrate (containing soluble ingredients) and carbomer slurry. 
 adjustment of the ph and sterilisation in a reactor; 
 3) 
 aseptic addition of milling slurry to the previous reactor. rinsing of the beads with sterilised 
 water; 
 4) 
 sterile filling (class a) into sterilised packaging (gamma irradiation or eto); 
 5) 
 secondary packaging. 
 the product is being manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary manufacturing authorisation 
 (see annex ii of the opinion). 
 the finished product specifications include tests for appearance, identification (hplc, chiral hplc 
 (r)), brinzolamide assay (hplc; 95-105%), benzalkonium chloride identity and assay (hplc, 90-
 110%), disodium edetate dihydrate identity and assay (hplc, 90-110%), ph (7.1-7.9), osmolality 
 (270-320 mosm/kg), resuspendability (nmt 15 seconds), viscosity (20-150 mpa.s), sterility (ep), and 
 fill volume. 
 particle size distribution is important. a validated method, hiac, for measuring the suspension 
 particle size has been developed, since the ph.eur. method (microscope) is difficult to use for products 
 containing carbomer, as these products contain small gel-globules with a similar appearance to that of 
 the particles. specifications concerning particle size are in accordance with ph.eur. for this type of 
 compound. 
 degradation products are measured by hplc (total nmt 1% (except s-isomer); des-ethyl 
 brinzolamide nmt 0.2% ; any single unspecified nmt 0.3%; s-isomer by chiral hplc nmt 1.5%), 
 the methods used for monitoring of des-ethyl brinzolamide and other potential degradation products 
 (hplc) and for monitoring the s-isomer have been validated. the impurity limits in the are justified 
 by toxicology studies
 . batch analysis results of 7 batches (using active substance supplied by amcis and finorga and packaged in both eto and gamma sterilised packaging) comply with the specifications.</p><p>
 stability of the product 
 stability data for six sublots (originating from 3 manufactured batches) of finished product are 
 presented. the longest duration of study for these lots is 2 years at room temperature (25 °c). in 
 addition to the stability study, data of five batches of finished product manufactured at alcon, puerto 
 rico, has been presented. for those batches sterilisation by gamma irradiation is used.</p><p>
 the stability data show that azopt is chemically, physically, and microbiologically stable for 2 years 
 in packaging sterilised with ethylene oxide. the efficacy of the antimicrobial preservative has been 
 shown in this period.</p><p>this is reflected in the spc.</p><p>updated stability data will be submitted when 
 available.</p><p> 5/25</p><p>

 once opened, a 28-day in-use period is justified on microbiological grounds. in addition an in-use study of chemical parameters was conducted on two batches, which have been stored at the long-term 
 storage condition (25°c/35% rh) for 2 years. after 28 days, the product samples were tested for 
 chemical as well as physical parameters</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>the proposed 28 days in-use shelf life is justified and acceptable, and is reflected in the spc.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. part iii: toxico-pharmacological aspects</header><p>pharmacodynamics inhibition of ca the potency and selectivity of brinzolamide for inhibition of ca-ii has been studied in vitro. brinzolamide has a k
 i for binding to ca-ii of 0.13 nm, and an enzyme inhibition ic50 of 3.2 nm. it is 240 to 400 times more selective for ca-ii than ca-i. brinzolamide and dorzolamide present a similar 
 selectivity for ca-ii, although dorzolamide might be more selective for ca-ii than for ca-i. the 
 primary metabolite of brinzolamide, desethyl-brinzolamide, was also tested in the binding and 
 functional activity assays, and was demonstrated to have a similar profile as the parent drug</p><p>in 
 in vitro assays brinzolamide selectively inhibited ca-ii with a potency similar to that of dorzolamide: ki for brinzolamide = 0.13nm compared to 0,31 nm for dorzolamide: ic 50 for 
 brinzolamide = 3.19 nm compared to 3.74 nm for dorzolamide. the selectivity of brinzolamide for 
 ca was demonstrated by a lack of affinity in 34 other types of receptor and enzyme-based ligand 
 binding assay systems. desethyl-brinzolamide shows the same pharmacological profile (ic 50</p><p>= 2.9 
 nm). 
 topical ocular iop reducing activity</p><p>the ca inhibitory activity of brinzolamide is supported by in vitro binding affinity and functional activity studies with purified human ca enzyme. iop reducing efficacy has been assessed 
 in vivo in rabbits and monkeys and its ability to increase optic nerve head blood flow was studied also in rabbits 
 and cats. 
 the iop lowering efficacy of brinzolamide was tested in normal dutch-belted (db) rabbits and in 
 ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys. suspension formulations of both the hydrochloride salt 
 and the free base effectively lowered iop in both species. dose dependent reductions of iop were 
 demonstrated in rabbits, while both 0.3 mg and 0.6 mg doses reduced iop by about 32% in the 
 monkey. in multi-dose studies with bid treatment up to 9 days in rabbits and 2 days in monkeys, a 
 relatively constant iop reduction was evident. iop was reduced in monkeys by 29-38% peak and 15-
 25% trough . 
 ocular blood flow enhancement optic nerve head (onh) microvascular blood flow of the cat and total, onh and regional intraocular blood flows in the rabbit were evaluated using coloured microsphere (cm) or laser doppler flowmetry 
 (ldf) techniques. onh (ldf method) blood flow was increased in both rabbits and cats by 
 intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg brinzolamide (46 ± 17% increase in cats, p &lt; 0.05). in rabbits, 
 brinzolamide at 0.5, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg cumulative intravenous doses produced significant, dose related 
 increases in blood flow (cm methods) of iris, ciliary body, choroid as well as the total ocular blood 
 flow. after one week of bid topical ocular administration of brinzolamide to db rabbits blood flow to 
 the optic nerve head was significantly increased (11% increase, p &lt; 0.05), as measured by the ldf. 
 general and safety pharmacology studies effects of brinzolamide on the central nervous system 
 brinzolamide and the desethyl-brinzolamide with doses up to 30 mg/kg did not have any effects on behaviour; locomotor activity; phenylquinone induced writhing; rotarod performance; or barbiturate 
 induced sleep time. there was also no effect on sensitivity to electroshock-induced convulsion or on 
 yeast-induced pyresis.</p><p>6/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 effects of brinzolamide on the cardiovascular system at a dose of 1 mg/kg neither brinzolamide nor desethyl-brinzolamide modified any cardiovascular parameter in dogs. at a dose of 10 mg/kg, brinzolamide, but not the desethyl-brinzolamide, induced 
 small increases in cardiac output and contractility. neither compounds at a dose of 10 mg/kg 
 significantly modified the blood pressure response to epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, 
 histamine and isoproterenol.</p><p>
 effects of brinzolamide on the respiratory system pulmonary mechanics of guinea pigs were not altered by 1 or 30 mg/kg doses of brinzolamide or desethyl brinzolamide. 
 blood gases in rats were not altered by 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg doses of either compound, but at 
 3 mg/kg, minor changes were noted with both compounds. these effects are consistent with inhibition 
 of ca, as evidenced by similar changes with the reference standard acetazolamide. 
 effects of brinzolamide on the gastrointestinal system in the gastrointestinal propulsion test, no changes were observed with oral doses of 1 or 10 mg/kg of brinzolamide or 1 mg/kg of desethyl-brinzolamide. a small reduction of charcoal propulsion was 
 noted with 30 mg/kg brinzolamide and with 10 and 30 mg/kg of desethyl-brinzolamide. this effect is 
 consistent with local inhibition of ca, altering volume in the intestinal tract, and secondarily 
 peristaltic activity. neither compound at a 10 mg/ml concentration altered contraction of isolated 
 guinea pig ileum induced 
 in vitro by acetylcholine, histamine or barium chloride.</p><p>effects of brinzolamide on the renal system minor dose-related increases in urine ph and in excretion of na+ and k+ were observed in rats following intravenous administration of 1 and 3 mg/kg brinzolamide and desethyl-brinzolamide. 
 the doses employed in these studies exceeded those achievable following topical ocular 
 administration of brinzolamide. if completely absorbed, ocular administration of bid 350 
 µg (one drop of 1%) brinzolamide per eye would result in a systemic load of only 28 
 µg/kg/day in a 50 kg individual. therefore, an ocular dose of 350 
 µg brinzolamide per eye per dose is not expected to cause significant adverse side effects in man. 
 pharmacodynamic interaction studies no studies with regard to pharmacodynamic interactions with beta-blockers have been performed, in view of the fact that beta-blockers such as timolol and metoprolol are metabolised by different 
 isozymes and those beta-blockers do not inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide and vice versa. 
 furthermore, brinzolamide does not strongly bind to plasma proteins and general pharmacology 
 studies with brinzolamide did not reveal any pharmacodynamic action that indicates a potential for 
 exacerbation of a beta-blocker effect. 
 pharmacokinetics 
 the pharmacokinetics of brinzolamide are specific and typical of sulfonamide anhydrase inhibitors 
 which are essentially influenced by a tight binding to ca. brinzolamide is mainly distributed to 
 tissues containing high levels of ca and particularly in red blood cells (rbcs). as brinzolamide 
 binding to rbcs is tight and saturable, low plasma levels and non linear kinetics were observed. the 
 pharmacokinetics of brinzolamide were studied in rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
 absorption brinzolamide is absorbed into the eye following topical ocular administration. maximum drug concentrations in aqueous humor and iris-ciliary body (icb) of 1.04 
 ± 0.38 µg/ml and 1.36 ± 0.34 µg/mg, respectively, were achieved 1 hour following a single topical ocular administration of a 1% aqueous suspension to new zealand white (nzw) rabbits. 
 absorption</p><p>into the systemic circulation from the topical ocular route also occurs. following a single 
 30 
 µl dose of a 4% suspension to nzw rabbits, maximum whole blood concentrations were observed between 3 and 24 hours. in the rabbit, plasma brinzolamide concentrations were approximately 4 and 
 30 
 µg/ml 5 minutes after i.v. doses of 5 and 30 mg/kg, respectively.</p><p> 7/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 brinzolamide was readily absorbed following oral dosing to rats. due to the saturable binding to ca in erythrocytes, non-linear kinetics and a lack of dose-proportionality were observed in whole blood, 
 which are characteristic features of this drug class. maximum plasma drug concentrations were 
 achieved within 15-30 minutes and exhibited dose dependence. based on areas under the plasma 
 concentration versus time curves (auc) for oral and intravenous doses, oral bioavailability ranged 
 from about 70% at 20 mg/kg to about 45% at 180 mg/kg. 
 distribution tissue distribution of 14c-brinzolamide was investigated in rats and rabbits.</p><p>in male fisher rats, after single oral dose the highest levels were observed in tissues containing high 
 ca activities, i.e. kidneys, liver, stomach, small intestine, spleen, lungs and salivary glands. after 
 repeated dose administration, the maximum tissue concentrations were 2 fold higher than after simple 
 dosing, showing a limited accumulation ratio (about 2). autoradiography studies showed a slight 
 penetration of brinzolamide through the blood brain barrier. the compound was found to cross the 
 placenta and was distributed in foetal tissues and in milk without accumulation (the milk/plasma ratio 
 ranging from 0.03 to 0.6). see also section 4.6 of the spc. 
 in the rabbit, brinzolamide was recovered in iris-ciliary body (icb), choroid, retina, lens and aqueous 
 humor after topical ocular administration. the shortest half-life (3 hours) was observed in aqueous 
 humor, followed by icb. lens and retina exhibited very prolonged exposure in both strains (t
 1/2 =294 days and t
 1/2 = 95.9 days respectively). a systemic redistribution has been demonstrated. in vitro plasma protein binding studies showed that brinzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins from various species (unbound fractions being 75%, 41% and 25% in rats, humans and monkeys, 
 respectively). 
 due to its high affinity for ca-ii, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the rbcs and exhibits a 
 long half-life in whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks). 
 metabolism from biotransformation studies of brinzolamide in rats and monkeys models, six different metabolites were identified in blood and faeces. significant concentrations of the main metabolite observed in man 
 (n-desethyl-brinzolamide) were also observed in these two species.</p><p>
 excretion excretion of brinzolamide was investigated in rats after i.v. injection of a 1 mg/kg dose. approximately equal amounts of radioactivity were excreted in urine (32%) and in the faeces (29%). 
 mass balance of radioactivity showed that 61% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the excreta 
 within 48 hours post dosing and the remaining was recovered in the carcass and blood. 
 conclusion no adverse findings for lens or retina were demonstrated in preclinical safety studies of brinzolamide by either topical ocular or oral administration. the systemic exposure in animals and humans is 
 summarised in table 1.</p><p>8/25</p><p>

 µl/drop) of a 2% suspension (20 µg/µl), resulting in an overall exposure of 800 µl x 20 
 µg/µl, or 16 mg total exposure per day (approximately 5 mg/kg). ocular comfort and irritation were evaluated. irritation and comfort scores were consistent with those normally observed with ophthalmic 
 suspensions, and no significant clinical findings were noted. these are considered screening studies, 
 are non-glp, and extensive systemic evaluations and histopathology were not conducted. 
 administration of single high oral doses of brinzolamide induced lethargy and reduced activity. the 
 proposed dosage form, 5 ml or 10 ml bottles (containing a total of 50 or 100 mg of drug, respectively), 
 precludes comparable accidental systemic exposure, the maximum possible accidental exposure being 
 approximately 5 mg/kg, assuming the complete contents were ingested by a 10 kg child. no 
 significant effects are likely to occur at this exposure.</p><p>the total daily dose for clinical ophthalmic 
 exposure (1 drop, bid, both eyes) is approximately 1.6 mg/day, or about 0.032 mg/kg/day.</p><p>
 repeated-dose toxicity a series of repeated-dose studies was conducted by the clinical route of administration, topical ocular, and by oral administration for increased systemic exposure and toxicological assessment. 
 ocular studies 
 five repeated-dose topical ocular studies were conducted in albino rabbits, ranging in duration from 
 one to six months, and a one year study was conducted in pigmented cynomolgus primates (table 2).</p><p>9/25</p><p>

 dosing frequency of 1%, bid. 
 in the topical ocular studies the following was carried out: slit-lamp biomicroscopic ophthalmic 
 examinations, indirect ophthalmic examinations, corneal pachymetry as well as body weight, serum 
 chemistry and haematology evaluations, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic pathologic 
 evaluations. the primate study also included specular microscopic evaluation of the corneal 
 endothelium. 
 analysis of whole blood samples from the six-months rabbit study obtained at study weeks 1 and 2, 
 and months one, three and six, demonstrated that a steady state whole blood concentration of 
 approximately 5-7 
 µg/ml was reached at about one week of dosing for both the 2% and 4% concentrations, while plasma levels were below the limits of quantitation. 
 these studies show that there was no significant ocular toxicity or irritation when the drug was 
 administered topically in either the rabbit or the</p><p>monkey eye. irritation scores, as evaluated by slit-
 lamp scoring of conjunctivitis, iritis and aqueous flare, were unremarkable compared with controls. in 
 addition, there were no significant findings from indirect ophthalmic examinations of ocular tissues of 
 the anterior or posterior segments of the fundus. 
 statistically significant increases in corneal thickness were observed in rabbits following 1, 3 and</p><p>
 6 months of treatment with brinzolamide eye drops. this information has been included in section 5.3 
 of the spc. increases in corneal thickness up to approximately 16% were not accompanied by changes 
 in slit-lamp biomicroscopic appearance or histologic morphology. no significant change in corneal 
 thickness was observed in the 1-year topical ocular study in monkeys, and specular microscopy of the 
 corneal endothelium revealed no changes in cell density or morphology. 
 a slight change in the product formulation (0.05% polysorbate 80 replaced with 0.025% tyloxapol) 
 was made after the completion of the six month rabbit study, and a three-month topical ocular study in 
 rabbits was conducted to confirm the safety of the modified formulation. in addition, a change in the 
 raw material sterilisation process (from gamma irradiation to eto) was made during development.</p><p>
 this change was addressed by re-supplying of dosing materials for the 1-year topical ocular study in 
 monkeys at approximately the six-month interval. thus, approximately six months of dosing was 
 completed before and after the minor product change. 
 systemic studies 
 repeated-dose systemic toxicity was evaluated by oral administration to rats and mice. an early two-
 week study by oral gavage administration in rats employed brinzolamide at relatively high 
 concentrations in a low ph aqueous vehicle (in order to provide a dosing solution). administration of 
 this solution, containing high concentrations of the ca inhibitor at low ph, resulted in significant 
 gastric lesions, including ulcerative and proliferative changes in the forestomach.</p><p>gastric ulceration 
 has been reported with administration of acetazolamide to rats, and may be related to inhibition of ca 
 activity and mucus secretion. a change of dosing preparations to a suspension at a more neutral ph 
 essentially eliminated the occurrence of gastric lesions. lethargy, dehydrated appearance and 
 unkemptness, and reduced body weight gain were apparent, particularly at the high dose of 
 180 mg/kg/day.</p><p>10/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 a four-week oral study in rats with the dosing suspension demonstrated reduced body weight gain at 100 mg/kg/day, with slight reductions in erythrocyte count, haematocrit and haemoglobin, increased 
 serum sodium, chloride and cholesterol and reduced serum potassium. the subsequent three-month 
 study in rats employed dose levels of up to 10 mg/kg/day without biologically significant effects on 
 haematology and serum chemistry parameters. urinary volume was significantly increased, while 
 urine specific gravity, sodium and potassium were significantly decreased. similar findings were seen 
 in a four-week study in mice. 
 three-month oral toxicity studies in rats with 0, 1, 3 and 8 mg/kg/day revealed nephrotoxicity and 
 urinary bladder hyperplasia. similar urinary tract findings were observed in the three-month oral study 
 in mice. 
 a six-month oral toxicity study in rats, with dose levels of 0, 1, 3 and 8 mg/kg/day, yielded results 
 similar to those observed in the three-month study. there were no significant effects in any of these 
 studies aside from urinary-renal findings. slight but statistically significant increases were observed in 
 serum chloride concentrations, particularly at the high dose. serum sodium and potassium levels 
 appeared to be minimally affected. urine volumes were generally modestly increased with the higher 
 doses, with concomitant reductions in specific gravity. urinary sodium and potassium concentrations 
 were significantly reduced. a slight increase in relative kidney weight was also apparent at the highest 
 dose, with females affected more than males. these findings are consistent with those observed with 
 other cais such as acetazolamide and dorzolamide.</p><p>urothelial hyperplasia has been found among 
 rodents receiving other cais. 
 genotoxicity two in vitro and two in vivo mutation assays as well as an in vivo/in vitro unscheduled dna synthesis assay were conducted with brinzolamide in order to evaluate the genotoxicity potential of the drug 
 substance. in a bacterial reverse mutation (ames) assay brinzolamide did not induce increases in the 
 numbers of revertants per plate for any tester strain in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. 
 a mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay was conducted at concentrations of up to 3000 
 µg/ml without activation and up to 2000 
 µg/ml with metabolic activation.</p><p>brinzolamide demonstrated no mutagenic activity without hepatic microsomal enzyme activation. in the presence of activation, dose 
 related increases in mutant frequencies, approximately two- to four-fold above background, were 
 observed. however, mutagenicity was always accompanied by high cytotoxicity (relative growth 
 generally reduced by 85% or more). hence, cytotoxicity may have contributed to mutagenicity. 
 a mouse micronucleus assay employing oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg revealed no genotoxic effects 
 on bone marrow cells harvested 24, 28 and 72 hours after dosing.</p><p>
 furthermore an 
 in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay in hamsters was conducted. treatment with brinzolamide did not induce an increase in sister chromatid exchange in bone marrow cells and an 
 in vivo/in vitro</p><p>unscheduled dna synthesis assay was also negative. cais, as a class, are not mutagenic and although brinzolamide showed some mutagenicity in one of the five tests performed, the overall 
 weight of evidence suggests that brinzolamide is consistent with the class. 
 carcinogenicity the applicant has sought scientific advice with regard to the need of the requirement for carcinogenicity studies in january 1996. although the cpmp accepted at that time not to perform 
 carcinogenicity studies, carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have been performed. 
 the study in rats, which employed oral gavage administration of 0,1,3 and 8 mg/kg/day brinzolamide, 
 demonstrated non-neoplastic lesions consistent with those observed in previous studies in this species. 
 one male of the high dose had an epithelial adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder, and one male of 
 the high dose had a papilloma of the urinary bladder. there was no other indication of carcinogenic 
 effect following two years of oral administration of brinzolamide to rats.</p><p>
 an increase in urinary bladder tumors (leiomyosarcomas) was observed in female mice given 
 brinzolamide 10 mg/kg/day, orally, for 24 months. dose-related proliferative changes in the urinary 
 bladder were observed among female mice at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, and among males at 3 and</p><p>
 10 mg/kg/day.</p><p>11/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 the elevated bladder tumor incidence, which was statistically significant, was primarily due to the increased occurrence of a smooth muscle tumor considered histomorphologically unique to mice. this 
 information is included in section 5.3 of the spc. 
 in conclusion it can be considered that brinzolamide pose little risk regarding carcinogenic potential. 
 reproduction toxicity studies investigating fertility and early embryonic development, embryo-foetal development and prenatal and postnatal development have been performed. 
 repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and mice incorporated careful histopathologic evaluation of the 
 testes to encompass complete spermatogenic cycles (approximately 10 weeks). 
 fertility and early embryonic development</p><p>
 in the fertility and general reproduction study in rats, 40 f0 males were treated for 99 days (more than 
 one spermatogenic cycle) and females were treated for 2 weeks prior to the mating period. 
 brinzolamide did not affect male or female fertility or general reproductive performance. slight, 
 statistically significant differences in body weight (up to approximately 10% at the high dose) were 
 seen in f0 males during the treatment phase and in females during the treatment phase and through 
 gestation. f1 foetal weights were lower in a dose-related manner, though no other maternal or foetal 
 parameters were affected. f1 pup weights were comparable between control and treated groups at 
 lactation day 1 but f1 pups weights were slightly to moderately decreased (approximately 13%), in 
 the high dose group at lactation days 14 and 21. there were no effects on f1 fertility and reproductive 
 performance, or on f2 offspring. the no-effect level for fertility and reproduction was considered to 
 be 18 mg/kg/day. 
 embryo-foetal development 
 doses of 0, 2, 6 and 18 mg/kg/day, were given orally by gavage, to 40 pregnant dams on gestation 
 days 6 through 17, with 20 employed for caesarean section and 20 delivering f1 pups. results were 
 generally similar to those obtained in the fertility study, with a slightly lower body weight for f0 dams 
 and a lower mean foetal weight for the high dose group compared with controls. increases in the 
 incidence of unossified sternebrae or hyoid and reduced ossification of the skull were observed at the 
 high dose only. this was hinted at in the fertility study, where only an apparent increase in unossified 
 sternebrae was noted. day 1 mean weights of delivered pups were comparable between the control 
 and treated groups. 
 a developmental toxicity study in rabbits employed oral gavage administration of brinzolamide at 
 dose levels of 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 through 18. substantial maternal toxicity 
 was evidenced at the high dose by one fatality, absence of faeces and emaciation, and two instances of 
 abortion. no malformations were observed and ossification appeared to be unaffected.</p><p>thus, 
 brinzolamide appeared to have no adverse effects on foetal development even in the presence of 
 extreme maternal toxicity. 
 classic cais are recognised as possessing developmental toxicity potential. acetazolamide, 
 dichlorphenamide, ethoxzolamide and benzolamide, at high dose levels, have been associated with 
 forelimb skeletal malformations in rats and mice. it has been suggested that the characteristic forelimb 
 reduction deformities observed in rats, mice and rabbits receiving acetazolamide does not occur in 
 monkeys due to lack of embryonic ca activity during the sensitive period of causal development. 
 further investigations suggested a reduction in embryonic intracellular ph to be the mechanism. in the 
 present studies with brinzolamide, only slight reductions in ossification have been observed in rats, 
 with no limb malformations apparent. 
 prenatal and postnatal development</p><p>
 a peri- and postnatal study in rats employed oral gavage administration of 0, 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day 
 brinzolamide from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20. sporadic instances of differences in f1 
 pup viability at or before day 4 and at the low and mid dose levels may have been due to 
 cannibalisation.</p><p>12/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 pup weights during lactation were comparable with controls for all treatment groups, until day 21, when the mean pup weight for the high dose group was slightly lower (8%) than controls. there was 
 no indication of impairment of late foetal or pup morphological, behavioural or functional 
 development. 
 other toxicity studies: immunostimulation study an immunostimulation study in the guinea pig, consisting of an induction phase by intradermal 
 injection and a challenge phase with patch applications showed no response. it can be concluded that 
 brinzolamide is a non-sensitiser substance. 
 cell proliferation study in rats 
 oral administration of 20, 60, 180 mg/kg/day to rats did not induce cell proliferation in the liver
 . phototoxicity study in a preliminary phototoxicity study new zealand white rabbits were exposed to azopt by dermal 
 application, followed by exposure to 5 joules/cm
 2 uva for 37 minutes. no phototoxic response was observed at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-exposure.</p><p>ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment:</p><p>exposure assessment estimates for the different environmental compartments have shown that, based on the methods and calculations presented in the guideline for environmental risk assessment, the 
 concentration of brinzolamide is below the established threshold values (0.001 
 µg/l for water and</p><p>10 ppb for soil) for concern. there are no factors regarding the toxicity of brinzolamide that would 
 require consideration of stricter criteria, and further investigations are not considered necessary.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. part iv: clinical aspects</header><p>introduction the most common type of glaucoma encountered in europe is primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) 
 which is strongly related to elevated iop (i.e., iop &gt; 21 mm hg). 
 topical cais constitute a new class, in which the single representative is 2% dorzolamide (trusopt), 
 eye drops marketed since 1996 in europe and indicated as second-line therapy (after a topical beta-
 blocker, e.g. timolol) with a tid regimen in monotherapy and bid regimen as adjunctive therapy. 
 both pilocarpine, the most commonly used miotic, and dorzolamide have similar additive hypotensive 
 effects when combined with a beta-blocker.</p><p>

 a total of 1390 patients or healthy volunteers involved. the studies were conducted in the usa,

 the ciliary processes of the eye decreasing aqueous humour secretion, presumably by slowing the 
 formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. no clinical 
 pharmacodynamic studies to further determine the mechanism of action on iop in humans were 
 performed. 
 recent studies suggested that glaucoma might have a vascular component on which drugs may act 
 directly contributing to improve ocular blood flow and visual contrast sensitivity. thus, in study c-97-
 61 brinzolamide (1%) was tested against placebo in healthy volunteers in a specific double-blind, 
 cross-over, single dose study to evaluate the effects of brinzolamide on ocular blood flow and visual 
 function. results showed that topical brinzolamide had no acute effects on retrobulbar and retinal and 
 superficial optic nerve head blood flows as well as on contrast sensitivity. 
 ca-ii and iv isoenzymes are present in corneal endothelial cells and play an important role in the

 abbreviations: see table 3. topical ocular administration none of the three topical studies (c-92-34, c-96-74, and c-95-47) was designed as a pharmacokinetic 
 study. some blood samples were obtained during safety or efficacy studies that only show that 
 brinzolamide is absorbed to some extent after topical ocular administration. the absorption of 
 brinzolamide after topical ocular administration cannot be estimated from these studies. 
 main pharmacokinetic properties 
 the data on pharmacokinetic parameters are limited. the bioavailability and volume of distribution 
 have not been determined as this would require intravenous administration of brinzolamide and this 
 could introduce a risk for patients or healthy volunteers. 
 following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. due to 
 its high affinity for ca-ii, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the rbcs and exhibits a long half-
 life in whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks). the major isozyme involved in the metabolism 
 of brinzolamide is cyp3a4, but at least 4 other isozymes are involved including cyp2a6, cyp2b6, 
 cyp2c8 and cyp2c9. in humans, the metabolite n-desethyl brinzolamide is formed, which also 
 binds to ca and accumulates in rbcs. this metabolite binds mainly to ca-i in the presence of 
 brinzolamide.</p><p>in plasma, both brinzolamide and n-desethyl brinzolamide concentrations are low and 
 generally below assay quantitation limits (&lt;7.5 ng/ml). binding to plasma proteins is not extensive 
 (about 60%). brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (approximately 60%).</p><p>
 about 20% of the dose has been accounted for in urine as metabolite. brinzolamide and n-desethyl-
 brinzolamide are the predominant components in the urine along with trace levels of the n-
 desmethoxypropyl and o-desmethyl metabolites.</p><p>15/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 oral administration healthy volunteers in study c-95-76 (1 mg) parent drug steady-state was achieved at approximately 12 weeks. n-desethyl metabolite steady-state was achieved within 20 to 28 weeks. the other metabolites were not detected 
 in whole blood. the levels of the parent drug and even more of n -desethyl metabolite were higher in 
 females than in males, but this was not considered to be clinically relevant. 
 renally impaired volunteers (crcl ≥ 30ml/min) in study c-96-59 (1 mg) steady-state levels were obtained later than that in normal healthy volunteers. at steady-state, the parent drug levels were about twice that measured in healthy normal volunteers. 
 the same phenomenon occurred for the n -desethyl metabolite, but was more pronounced. however, 
 safety studies did not show an increase in the frequency of systemic adverse events due to 
 accumulation and consequently a higher degree of ca inhibition. 
 no studies have been performed in patients with severe renal impairment (crcl&lt;30ml/min) as cais 
 can produce acidosis and this population is susceptible to this adverse reaction. ca inhibitors are 
 contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis 
 (see section 4.3 of the spc). 
 hepatic impairment</p><p>
 brinzolamide has not been studied in hepatic impaired subjects because brinzolamide does not have a 
 narrow therapeutic index and renal excretion is the main route of elimination, and therefore studies in 
 such a population were not considered necessary. however, brinzolamide should be used with caution, 
 as reflected in sections 4.2 of the spc.</p><p>elderly patients (&gt;65 years of age)</p><p>
 a representative number of patients from 66 to 75 years (n=670) and from 76 to 85 years</p><p>(n=222) 
 have been included in the clinical studies. no dosage alteration in elderly patients is necessary, as 
 reflected in section 4.2 of the spc.</p><p>interactions 
 no specific drug interaction studies were performed, in view of the fact that beta-blockers such as 
 timolol and metoprolol are metabolised by different isozymes and those beta-blockers do not inhibit 
 the metabolism of brinzolamide and vice versa. furthermore, brinzolamide does not strongly bind to 
 plasma proteins.</p><p>the lack of interaction studies is justified on the basis of available clinical data with 
 regard to the co-administration with timolol, which is currently by far the most used beta-blocker in 
 glaucoma. based on theoretical grounds no differences are expected with the behaviour of other beta-
 blockers.</p><p>no specific interaction studies were performed. this was considered acceptable as efficacy is related 
 to local rather than systemic concentrations. 
 it is recognised that brinzolamide and its main metabolite (n-desethyl-brinzolamide) bind to ca and 
 are sequestered into rcbs. based on this fact, brinzolamide is unlikely to be involved in interactions 
 with other medicinal products. the reasons that indicate that brinzolamide is unlikely to interact with 
 other drugs are: 
 1 
 brinzolamide has multiple elimination pathways and metabolism by multiple isozymes of 
 cytochrome p-450. cyp-3a4 is a major contributor to metabolic elimination but 4 other 
 isozymes are also available for clearance of the drug. hence, if cyp-3a4 was inhibited, renal 
 clearance and liver metabolism by the remaining isozymes could eliminate the drug. 
 2 
 changes in brinzolamide availability due to inhibition of cyp-3a4 will not significantly alter 
 concentrations of drugs in plasma or rbcs because at steady state brinzolamide binding to ca 
 is saturated and unbound brinzolamide is rapidly cleared by renal excretion and liver 
 metabolism.</p><p>16/25</p><p>

 3 brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome p-450 isozyme even at concentrations that are 
 more than 100-fold higher than those found in plasma at steady state in humans. 
 4 brinzolamide is approximately 60% plasma protein bound.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>the clinical trials were performed according to gcp standards and agreed international ethical principles
 . dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
 dose-response and dosing regimen studies to establish the appropriate concentration of brinzolamide one study was performed (study c-92-25; 
 see table 3). this was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study in patients 
 with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertensive patients for whom ocular hypotensive therapy is 
 indicated. patients were administered azopt 0.3% (n=29), 1% (n=34), 2% (n=30) and 3% (n=33). all 
 treatment dosed one drop/eye bid, topically during 15 days. placebo was used in the same dose-
 regimen (n=31). 
 the efficacy endpoint was the mean per cent change from diurnally adjusted baseline iop. the dose 
 response curve represented by a graph of least square means of percent reduction in iop, reached a 
 plateau at 1%, indicating that the optimal effective brinzolamide concentration is 1%. this 
 concentration showed similar tolerance as lower concentrations. 
 two studies were designed with the purpose of finding the proper dosing regimen (study c-94-49 and 
 study</p><p>c-94-71, see table 3). 
 study c-94-49 this was a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study, in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. patients were administered brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension, 
 one drop/eye bid (n=51) or tid (n=54), topically. patients in the bid group also received one 
 drop/eye vehicle to preserve the study blinding. duration of treatment was 4 weeks. 
 the efficacy endpoint was iop changes in mmhg from diurnal baselines. clinically and statistically 
 significant iop decrease was noted when bid or tid regimens were administered. bid and tid 
 treatments were equivalent.</p><p>study c-94-71 this was a single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised, parallel group study in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion 
 component) or ocular hypertension. patients were administered brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic 
 suspension, two drops in each eye qid (n=23) employing nasal lacrimal occlusion after each dose 
 during four weeks. the placebo consisted of brinzolamide vehicle, two drops in each eye qid (n=5), 
 during four weeks.</p><p>
 the efficacy endpoint was iop changes from diurnal baseline. brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic 
 suspension dosed qid followed by two minutes of nasal lacrimal occlusion resulted in clinically 
 significant iop reduction from baseline. compared to the previous results, in this reduced sample size 
 the iop lowering efficacy of brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension was not significantly enhanced 
 by increasing the dosing frequency to qid. in addition, brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension was well 
 tolerated when administered qid.

 abbreviations: see table 3. iop, measured by goldmann applanation tonometry was the efficacy parameter in all clinical efficacy studies and the chosen primary endpoint was the change of iop from the diurnal baseline. however, 
 results are also expressed as the mean decrease of iop and percentage of responders, who were 
 defined as patients reaching an iop 
 ≤ 21 mmhg or with a decrease of at least 5 mmhg. to accept equivalence between treatments, the minimum relevant difference to be detected was fixed at</p><p>
 1.5 mmhg.</p><p>the endpoint was evaluated at three months in all clinical trials except in one trial where the double 
 blind period was extended up to 18 months. 
 assessment of visual loss and optic nerve damage has been performed only from the safety point of 
 view, and studies were neither long nor large enough to detect differences in these relevant 
 parameters. however, the demonstration of efficacy based only on decreases in iop is an acceptable 
 approach.</p><p>18/25</p><p>

 the demographic characteristics of patients receiving brinzolamide 1%, trusopt and timoptic 0.5% in the controlled trials were similar regarding age distribution, sex, ethnic origin and iris colour. the 
 number of patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age included in the studies with brinzolamide was 683, of which</p><p>579 received brinzolamide monotherapy and 104 brinzolamide added to timolol. treatment in monotherapy versus beta-blocker two comparative monotherapy studies versus timolol (with bid and tid-dosing over 3 months and 
 18 months) have been presented (study c-95-47 and c-95-48). the difference in iop reduction 
 between timolol and brinzolamide was up to 2 mm hg at trough, favouring timolol (study c-95-47). 
 at peak, pooled data demonstrated that timolol was also more effective than brinzolamide with a 
 statistically significant difference in mean iop changes between timolol (bid) and brinzolamide 
 (tid). the magnitude of the decrease across studies ranged from -2.7 to -5.7 mmhg with 
 brinzolamide bid, from -2.8 to -5.6 mmhg with brinzolamide tid and from -5.2 to -6.0 mmhg with 
 timolol 0.5% bid. 
 versus cais 
 the iop-lowering effect of brinzolamide 1% (bid or tid) was comparable to that of dorzolamide</p><p>
 2% (tid) when given as first-line monotherapy in two studies (c-95-46 and c-95-48). however, in 
 the eu, topical dorzolamide is considered to be a second-line drug in the treatment of glaucoma. the 
 magnitude of the decrease across studies ranged from -3.4 to -5.7 mmhg with brinzolamide bid, from 
 -4.1 to -5.6 mmhg with brinzolamide tid and from -4.3 to -4.9 mmhg with dorzolamide tid. 
 the long-term effect of brinzolamide on the diurnal rhythm of iop has not been extensively 
 investigated in long-term studies (study c-95-47).</p><p>
 statistical analysis 
 both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were presented in the clinical study reports of the 
 superiority trials versus placebo and versus timolol. for studies c-95-38, c-95-48, c-95-46 and c-
 95-47 results of the itt analyses and per protocol analyses are similar. 
 there were four confirmatory studies where statistical tests relative to timolol or placebo were 
 performed. the applicant has extracted the intent-to-treat and the per-protocol results for the 
 superiority results for these studies. the results have been pooled across visits and by visit.</p><p>
 treatment in adjunctive therapy in addition to timolol two studies as an add-on to timolol have been performed, the first versus placebo (study c-95-38</p></section><section><header>)</header><p>, the second versus dorzolamide (study c-95-39). the length of the two adjunctive studies is relatively 
 short (3 months)</p><p>
 versus placebo 
 tid dosing with brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension when used adjunctively with timolol 0.5% 
 ophthalmic solution produced clinically and statistically significant iop reductions from baseline. 
 mean iop changes from baseline of brinzolamide as add-on to timolol were significantly greater 
 (p=0.0329) compared to placebo + timolol. the magnitude of the decrease with brinzolamide ranged 
 from -3.2 to -4.1 mmhg and the decrease with placebo ranged from -1.0 mmhg to -2.6 mmhg 
 versus dorzolamide 
 bid dosing with brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension when used adjunctively to timolol 0.5% 
 ophthalmic solution produced clinically and statistically significant iop reductions from baseline at 
 each treatment visit. the results were equivalent for brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension and 
 dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution. none of the upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of the 
 differences was above the a priori established value of 1.5 mmhg and most of them were inferior to 1 
 mmhg. the magnitude of the decrease ranged from –3.6 to –5.3 mmhg with brinzolamide bid and 
 from –3.6 to –5.1 mmhg with dorzolamide bid.</p><p>19/25</p><p>

 in addition to other agents the efficacy of brinzolamide 1% in adjunction with other drugs used in ocular hypertension treatment 
 (prostaglandins, adrenergic agonists, and miotics) was not studied. the only recommended association 
 is with beta-blockers. 
 long term effects there was no tachyphylaxis during the study period (18 months). a duration of 3 months is generally sufficient to show adequate efficacy of a topical ocular hypotensive medication, since it allows iop to 
 stabilise. in adjunctive therapy, long term data (up to 6 months) are available on 75 patients. 
 additionally, up to 9 months data are available on 38 of these 75 patients. 
 rebound effect a possible rebound increase in iop after withdrawal of brinzolamide eye drops has not been investigated. this is reflected in section 4.4. of the spc.</p><p>clinical studies in special populations the experience with brinzolamide in the treatment of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma is limited and no specific clinical data were obtained in patients wearing contact lenses. this 
 has been reflected in section 4.4. of the spc.</p></section><section><header>dose regimen</header><p>with regards to the possible superiority of the tid regimen versus the proposed bid regimen, the following information is available.</p><p>
 one clinical pharmacology study (c-94-49) compared bid and tid dosing regimens measuring iop 
 at 5 different time points during the day, without finding differences between both regimens 
 (magnitude of differences at all time points less than 1 mmhg).</p><p>
 both regimens were tested in the three pivotal clinical trials. in them, brinzolamide bid showed 
 superiority versus placebo and similar efficacy as dorzolamide. in one of these trials (c-95-46), 
 equivalence between bid and tid could not be demonstrated and the bid regiment appeared to be 
 inferior to tid. confidence intervals of the difference were above the prespecified delta of 1.5 mmhg 
 at different time points. regarding the percentage of responders there is about a 10% less responders 
 to bid brinzolamide than with the other two regimens.</p><p>
 the other two studies failed to show differences between both regimens, one of them showing also 
 equivalence to dorzolamide (c-95-48) and the third one inferiority versus timolol (c-95-47). in both 
 trials iop was measured at different time points including the worst possible case for the bid regimen 
 which is 12 hours post dose coinciding with the peak of the circadian rhythm of the iop. if 
 equivalence is tested, the upper limit of the confidence interval of the difference is below 1.1 mmhg at 
 all time points during the 3 months trial and below 1.4 mmhg at all time points during the 18 months 
 trial. 
 the applicant states that the bid regimen is the preferred regimen. the superior efficacy of the tid 
 regimen, if it exists, would be about 1 mmhg, which has no clinical significance. the long-term trial 
 does not find differences in iop between both regimens and only one of the two 3-month trials 
 suggests a difference of the above-mentioned magnitude. 
 according to the applicant it is obvious that most patients controlled with brinzolamide do not need 
 more than bid and also facilitation of compliance and commodity should be taken into account as 
 well as minimising the exposure to benzalkonium. moreover, it is mandatory that patients with high 
 iop are closely monitored allowing to detect easily an insufficient control. 
 however, it could be argued that the tid regimen should be the preferred one. the arguments in 
 favour of a tid regimen are the following: with regard to the compliance, the statement made by the 
 applicant is weak as compliance was never assessed in the file. although the iop differences are 
 inferior to 1 mmhg and thus, without clinical significance the overall number of controlled patients is 
 always higher with the tid regimen rather than the bid regimen.</p><p>20/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 this is of clinical significance and demonstrated in the file. moreover in the 18-month study iop was not measured at the late afternoon point, and thus due to the inter-individual variation in nycthemeral 
 iop, there is no confirmation of the nycthemeral control beyond a 3-month duration. 
 therefore the following wording has been included in section 4.2 of the spc: 
 “when used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the usual dose is one drop of azopt eye drops in 
 the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) twice daily. some patients may have a better response with 
 one drop three times a day.”</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>patient exposure a total of 2530 patients or healthy volunteers were included in the clinical trials (excluding the on-going study c-96-60). of them, 1227 patients received brinzolamide eye drops 1% alone. as primary 
 therapy, 542 were treated at the recommended daily dosage of brinzolamide 1% bid and 616 and</p><p>
 23 patients were treated with brinzolamide 1% tid or qid respectively. as adjunctive therapy to 
 timolol 0.5% 139 and 65 patients received brinzolamide 1% bid or tid respectively. in addition,</p><p>
 48 volunteers received brinzolamide orally and 176 patients received concentrations of topical 
 brinzolamide other than 1%. 
 two studies in specific populations were added as required by the cpmp for safety evaluation 
 (scientific advice; 1996): 
 • study c-97-46, a clinical safety study to demonstrate the absence of acute effects of a single drop administration of brinzolamide on pulmonary function. 
 • study c-96-60, a clinical safety study to demonstrate the reversibility of timolol- induced airway obstruction and the safety advantage of brinzolamide as first-line therapy. 
 furthermore, a</p><p>multicentre, open label, adjunctive-therapy study (c-97-27) was performed to study the 
 long-term safety of bid-dosed brinzolamide 1.0% ophthalmic suspension.

 adverse events and serious adverse events one hundred and fifty-seven (157) of the 1227 patients (12.8%) experienced 227 ocular events and 106 (8.6%) patients experienced 140 non-ocular events related with brinzolamide 1%. 
 the reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate, usually resolved with or without therapy 
 and generally did not requested discontinuation in the study. 
 the most frequent ocular adverse events related or unrelated to brinzolamide 1%, taking into account 
 the overall frequency and incidence of adverse events for all treatment groups, were blurred vision 
 (temporary blurring upon instillation lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes) 5.8%, ocular 
 discomfort (transient burning or stinging upon instillation) 3.1%, ocular hyperaemia (2.5%), foreign 
 body sensation (2.4%), ocular pain (1.8%), blepharitis (1.5%), dry eye (1.5%), cataract (1.5%), optic 
 nerve disorder (1.5%), ocular discharge (1.3%), ocular pruritus (1.3%), and keratitis (1.1%). other 
 ocular events at an incidence rate between 0.9 and 0.6 percent were conjunctivitis, tearing, abnormal 
 vision, subconjunctival haemorrhage, and lid margin crusting. 
 non-ocular events at an incidence higher than 1% included taste perversion (bitter or unusual taste) 
 5.5%, headache (2.2%), infection (2.1%), surgical/medical procedures (2%), cold syndrome (1.9%), 
 pain (1.9%), hypertension (1.1%), diarrhoea (1%), rhinitis (1.5%), sinusitis (1.4%), pharyngitis 
 (1.5%), bronchitis (1.4%), and dermatitis (1.1%). 
 the profile of ocular adverse events of brinzolamide in association to timolol 0.5 % was similar to 
 brinzolamide alone. the most frequent events was blurred vision (4.9%) taste perversion (4.4%) 
 ocular discomfort (1.5%) and foreign body sensation (1%). however some specific adverse events of 
 beta-blockers, as asthma appeared with an incidence of 1%. 
 no serious related adverse events were reported for brinzolamide 1%, but 20 patients (6 in regimen 
 tid and 14 in bid) were discontinued from the study due to related ocular events (blurred vision, 
 ocular pain, keratitis and ocular discomfort were the most frequent reasons) and 14 patients (7 in 
 regimen tid and 7 in bid) were discontinued due to related non-ocular events (taste perversion, 
 dizziness, headache, diarrhoea, asthenia, depersonalisation, nervousness, dermatitis, pruritus were 
 some of the reasons).</p><p>
 in 4 patients the reason of discontinuation was taste perversion, which appeared in 3 of the 4 cases in 
 tid regimen. the 2 cases of dizziness that conducted to discontinuation of treatment appeared in tid 
 regimen.</p><p>
 five patients treated with the association of brinzolamide and timolol 0.5% discontinued the study due 
 to 4 related non-ocular events (2 cases of asthma, cough, pharyngitis). 
 adverse events of brinzolamide 1% (bid, tid) in comparisons of 2% and 3%. four dose-ranging studies were conducted</p><p>(c-95-25, c-95-46, c-95-47 and c-95-48); two of them were conducted including placebo (c-95-46 and c92-25).</p><p>
 blurred vision (1.7%, 5.0 %, 5.3 % and 7.4 % with placebo, brinzolamide 1%, 2% and 3% 
 respectively) ocular discomfort (2.6%, 2.5 %, 2.6 % and 2.9 % with placebo, brinzolamide 1%, 2% 
 and 3%, respectively) and taste perversion (5.5% with brinzolamide 1% but 13.2 % and 38.2 % with 
 brinzolamide 2% and 3% respectively) were the most frequent events related to brinzolamide. other 
 events related were hyperaemia, dry eye, pain, discharge, ocular pruritus, keratitis, lid margin crusting 
 and ocular precipitate (active substances residue; only with brinzolamide 3%). 
 in general it seems that there is correlation between adverse events and dose, especially for blurred 
 vision and taste perversion. the greatest percentage of patients experiencing treatment related adverse 
 events was described with brinzolamide 3% and the least with brinzolamide 0.3%, with no clinically 
 significant difference between brinzolamide 1% and 2%. 
 adverse events in comparisons to the same therapeutic class (dorzolamide) four studies (c-95-46, c-95-48, c-96-29 and c-96-40) were conducted with dorzolamide as active control treatment.</p><p>22/25</p><p>
 © emea 2004 
 in study c-95-46, ocular discomfort (3.0 % and 3.0%) and blurred vision (3.0% and 2.3%) were the 
 most frequent ocular events related to brinzolamide 1% bid and tid respectively. ocular discomfort 
 was the most frequent ocular event (10.7%) related to dorzolamide 2%. 
 the percentage of patients with ocular discomfort was higher (10.7%) in the dorzolamide group than 
 in any of the brinzolamide groups (3.0%), but the percentage of other ocular events was slightly higher 
 in the brinzolamide group. as a consequence, the global percentage of adverse events was similar in 
 both groups. the ocular discomfort was not related to a higher number of withdrawals since only one 
 patient withdrew in the dorzolamide group (accident injury) whereas 4 patients receiving brinzolamide 
 1% bid were discontinued from the study due to 9 adverse events (most of which ocular events) and</p><p>
 2 patients from placebo group (corneal abrasion and pneumonia). one patient receiving brinzolamide 
 1% tid was discontinued due to dermatitis and urticaria and one due to treatment unrelated 
 myocardial infarction. in contrast the percentage of patients experiencing ocular discomfort in the 
 placebo group was very low (1.5%). 
 in study c-95-48 the adverse events profile with brinzolamide and dorzolamide was similar to that 
 observed in the previous study: blurred vision (3% and 0.6%) and ocular discomfort</p><p>(1.8% and 
 16.4%) were the most frequent adverse events with brinzolamide 1% bid and dorzolamide 2% tid, 
 respectively. 
 in studies c-96-29 and c-96-40, brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension tid resulted in statistically 
 lower ocular discomfort score (0.2 and 0.4 units) than dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution tid</p><p>
 (1.3 and 1.7).</p><p>there was a greater percentage of patients experiencing no discomfort with 
 brinzolamide (71.2 and 81.3% respectively) compared to dorzolamide (19.6 and 17.0% respectively), 
 that is 28.8 and 18.7.7% respectively of the patients in the group of brinzolamide and 80.4-83.0 % in 
 the group of trusopt presented discomfort. because of the design of the studies, the percentage 
 patients showing some extent of discomfort is greater than the incidence of ocular discomfort reported 
 spontaneously in the remaining studies.</p><p>
 other ocular events were observed in the brinzolamide and in the trusopt group with a similar 
 percentage as in phase iii studies. 
 no statistically or clinically significant worsening in visual acuity was observed between treatment 
 groups. 
 adverse events in comparisons to the reference therapeutic class (beta-blockers) two studies (c-95-47 and c-95-48) were conducted with timolol 0.5% as active control treatment.</p><p>the incidence of ocular adverse events in the brinzolamide 1% group and timolol group seems similar, 
 however, a higher percentage of patients with blurred vision (5.0% and 2.8 % in brinzolamide 1% and 
 timoptic 0.5 % respectively) was observed in the brinzolamide group. 
 the only non-ocular adverse events described in timolol group with an incidence higher than 1 % was 
 dyspnea (2%). headache was described in the timolol group with an incidence of 0.8% (1.3% with 
 brinzolamide 1% ), asthenia with 0.4%</p><p>(0.1% in brinzolamide group), dry mouth with 0.4%</p><p>(0.7% in 
 brinzolamide group), bronchitis or asthma 1.2% compared to 0.2 % asthma in brinzolamide 0.1%. 
 endothelial cell density (cells/mm3) and corneal thickness (pachymetry) was measured in the study</p><p>
 c-95-47 at baseline, month 6, month 12 and month 18. no effects have been observed. 
 laboratory findings blood chemistry, haematology and urinalysis values were measured at baseline and post dosing in nine studies on study weeks 1 to 32 for 1668 patients. no relevant changes were detected from 
 baseline or between active drugs. 
 haematological effects 
 no bone marrow effect was observed in the clinical trials with 1% brinzolamide, but anaemia was 
 reported in one patient.</p><p>23/25</p><p>

 renal and metabolic effects acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were observed with brinzolamide. for brinzolamide 1% used 
 as monotherapy 4 adrs were reported (1 case of kidney calculus, 1 case of gout, 1 case of 
 hypokalemia, and 1 case of hyperchloremia). 1 case of dysuria has been reported for brinzolamide 1% 
 used as adjunctive therapy 
 respiratory tolerance of topical brinzolamide 
 this was assessed in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (study c-97-46). 
 in contrast to timolol 0.5%, brinzolamide 1% tid-dosed did not reduce forced expiratory volume in 
 one second (fev1) in volunteers with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 cardiovascular evaluation</p><p>
 no clinically relevant differences were shown in the mean pulse, systolic or diastolic blood pressure 
 between patients receiving ocular brinzolamide, dorzolamide or timolol. 
 safety in special populations a separate analysis of adrs in risk groups has been presented. diabetics 
 elevated blood glucose and glycosuria have been reported in diabetics and prediabetics receiving 
 systemic ca inhibitors. these drugs may interfere with the hypoglycaemic response to insulin or oral 
 antidiabetic agents. 
 in clinical studies, 174 diabetic patients received brinzolamide. none of the adverse events associated 
 with discontinuation from the studies were associated with a worsening of the diabetic condition.</p><p>no 
 serious events related to brinzolamide were reported in diabetics and no specific adverse events were 
 documented in such patients receiving brinzolamide. 
 asthmatics 
 ca inhibitors may increase carbon dioxide tension in tissues and may decrease carbon dioxide tension 
 in alveoli. respiratory and metabolic acidosis caused by ca inhibitors may increase oxygenation 
 during hypoxia by increasing ventilation, cerebral blood flow and/or dissociation of oxygen from 
 oxyhemoglobin. 
 respiratory difficulties may be increased by systemic ca inhibitors in patients with chronic 
 obstructive lung disease. forty-nine asthmatics were administered brinzolamide in clinical studies. no 
 serious events related to brinzolamide were reported in asthmatics and no specific adverse events were 
 documented in such patients receiving brinzolamide. 
 patients on antihypertensive medications 
 systemic ca inhibitors may augment the effects of other diuretics. diuretics may cause increased 
 excretion of potassium and patients receiving diuretics plus a cais may experience severe 
 hypokaliemia. ca inhibitors can compete with chlorthalidone and alter the response to it. four 
 hundred and thirty nine patients receiving antihypertensive medications participated in brinzolamide 
 studies in monotherapy (386) or added to timolol (53). no serious events related to brinzolamide were 
 reported in patients on antihypertensive medications and no specific adverse events were documented 
 in such population while receiving brinzolamide. 
 patients with hepatic insufficiency 
 patients with hepatic cirrhosis and hypokaliemia and/or elevations in blood ammonia concentrations 
 caused by systemic ca inhibitor may develop hepatic coma or precoma, as well as disorientation. 
 no patients with hepatic insufficiency participated in clinical studies with brinzolamide. this has been 
 reflected in section 4.2. of the spc</p><p>24/25</p><p>

 elderly patients the number of patients 
 ≥ 65 years of age included in the studies with brinzolamide was 683, of which 579 received brinzolamide monotherapy and 104 added to timolol. the adverse events associated with brinzolamide 1% are similar to those in patients other ages. no serious events related to brinzolamide 
 were reported for elderly patients. for ca inhibitors there is a general recommendation to warn that 
 the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical coordination could be impaired. 
 this warning has been included in section 4.4 of the spc. 
 females on hormone replacement therapy 
 one hundred sixty female patients on hormone replacement therapy participated in clinical studies 
 with brinzolamide (150 in monotherapy and 10 added to timolol). no serious events or 
 discontinuations related to brinzolamide were reported for females on hormone replacement therapy.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment 
 quality</header><p>in summary, the documentation of substances, materials, methods of production as well as the quality controls is sufficient to ensure a sterile product of consistent quality, suitable for ophthalmic use when 
 used in accordance with the conditions defined in the spc. physicochemical and biological aspects 
 relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
 in a satisfactory way. 
 a number of follow-up measures have been agreed (see section ii.3)</p></section><section><header>preclinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>brinzolamide has shown to be toxico-pharmacologically comparable to the other drug of its class.</p><p>overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that the properties of 
 brinzolamide, both general and ocular, are consistent with inhibition of ca, with affinity for the ca 
 isoform ii.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of brinzolamide are specific and typical of sulphonamide anhydrase inhibitors 
 which are essentially influenced by a tight binding to ca. 
 overall, the toxicology programme revealed no major findings. based on the results of the 
 carcinogenicity studies it can be considered that brinzolamide poses little risk regarding carcinogenic 
 potential and that the benefit-risk ratio is not affected. 
 relevant information on the toxicity profile has been included in the spc.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>the clinical development program of brinzolamide 1% bid ophthalmic suspension is considered adequate. brinzolamide 1% bid or tid is considered to be comparable to dorzolamide 2% tid in 
 monotherapy, the tid administration of brinzolamide being closer to tid administration of 
 dorzolamide.</p><p>
 assessment of visual loss and optic nerve damage has been performed only from the safety point of 
 view, and studies were not long or large enough to detect differences in these relevant parameters. 
 however, the demonstration of efficacy based only on decreases in iop is an acceptable approach. 
 evidence of efficacy is not sufficient to recommend the use of brinzolamide 1% in the treatment of 
 glaucoma or ocular hypertension as first line monotherapy. brinzolamide 1% bid used in 
 monotherapy showed a consistently lower efficacy than timolol 0.5% bid in both clinical trials where 
 this comparison was performed. the percentage of responders was greater with timolol and that 
 difference was more evident in the first measure in the morning, the peak measure of iop. 
 brinzolamide 1% bid or tid is considered to be comparable to dorzolamide 2% tid in 
 monotherapy. therefore the use as monotherapy in patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in 
 patients in patients in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated is acceptable.</p><p>25/25</p><p>

 although the clinical trials did not focus on showing efficacy in those patients, they were included in clinical trials and there is no reason to suspect that underlying diseases such as asthma or other 
 contraindications to beta-blockers could be associated with a different response of this drug in 
 glaucoma patients. in addition, brinzolamide (although used tid in this trial) is superior to placebo 
 when used in addition to timolol.</p><p>there are no clinical trials carried out in patients unresponsive to beta blockers. therefore, there is no 
 knowledge on the expected rate of response in such population. however, in line with the accepted 
 indication for other ca inhibitors the wording of the indication is acceptable. 
 the doses and dose regimens have been properly defined. the amount of long-term data is limited, but is considered to be sufficient. no studies have been performed in patients with renal and hepatic 
 impairment, and this has been reflected in the spc. no dosage adjustments are necessary in the 
 elderly. the lack of studies with regard to pharmacodynamic interactions with beta-blockers has been 
 justified.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>no major safety concerns were identified in the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. the reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate, usually resolved with or without therapy, and 
 generally did not request the discontinuation of trial therapy. 
 the profile of ocular adverse events of brinzolamide 1% was similar to that of dorzolamide 2%. the 
 percentage of patients with ocular discomfort was higher in the dorzolamide group than in the 
 brinzolamide group, but the percentage of other ocular events was lightly superior in the brinzolamide 
 group. as a consequence, the overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups. 
 the profiles of ocular adverse events of brinzolamide 1% bid and tid were similar. 
 timolol produced less ocular adverse events than brinzolamide 1%, but some non-ocular adverse 
 events related to specific effects of beta-blockers occurred. however, adverse event related to 
 digestive tract (dry mouth, nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhoea), nervous system (paresthesia, depression, 
 dizziness, dream abnormality) and special senses (taste perversion) that were described in the 
 brinzolamide group, were not described in the timolol group. 
 the profile of ocular adverse events of brinzolamide in association to timolol 0.5 % was similar to that 
 of brinzolamide alone. however, some specific adverse events of beta-blockers occurred. 
 no serious drug related adverse events were reported for brinzolamide 1%. the amount of long-term 
 safety data, although limited, is acceptable.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>based on the cpmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the cpmp considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of azopt was favourable in the indication to decrease elevated intraocular 
 pressure in ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma as monotherapy in patients unresponsive to 
 beta-blockers or in patients in whom beta-blockers are contra-indicated, or as adjunctive therapy to 
 beta-blockers.</p></section></body></xml>
