 azopt is a white to off-white suspension.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical particulars</header></section><section><header n="4.1">4.1 therapeutic indications</header><p>azopt is indicated to decrease elevated intraocular pressure in: • 
 ocular hypertension 
 • 
 open-angle glaucoma 
 as monotherapy in patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in patients in whom beta-blockers are 
 contraindicated, or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues (see section 5.1).</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>when used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the dose is one drop of azopt in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) twice daily.</p><p>some patients may have a better response with one drop three times a 
 day.</p><p>
 nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation is recommended.</p><p>this may reduce 
 the systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a decrease in 
 systemic side effects.</p><p>
 when substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with azopt, discontinue the other agent and 
 start the following day with azopt.</p><p>
 if more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicines must be administered 
 at least 5 minutes apart.</p><p>
 shake well before use.</p><p>to prevent contamination of the dropper tip and suspension, care must be taken 
 not to touch the eyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle.</p><p>keep the 
 bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><p>
 use in elderly 
 no dosage alteration in elderly patients is necessary. 
 3</p><p>
 use in children the efficacy and safety of azopt in patients below the age of 18 have not been established and its use is 
 not recommended in these patients. however, there is limited experience in children. 
 the safety and efficacy of azopt have been studied in a small number of paediatric patients less than 
 6 years of age (see also 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).</p><p>
 use in hepatic and renal impairment 
 azopt has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended in 
 such patients.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) 
 or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis.</p><p>since brinzolamide and its main metabolite are excreted 
 predominantly by the kidney, azopt is therefore contra-indicated in such patients (see also 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contra-indications</header><p>• hypersensitivity to brinzolamide or any of the excipients. 
 • 
 known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see also 4.4). 
 • 
 severe renal impairment. 
 • 
 hyperchloraemic acidosis (see also 4.2).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>azopt is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically.</p><p>acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase 
 inhibitors.</p><p>brinzolamide has not been studied in pre-term infants (less than 36 weeks gestational age) or 
 those less than 1 week of age.</p><p>patients with significant renal tubular immaturity or abnormalities should 
 only receive brinzolamide after careful consideration of the risk benefit balance because of the possible 
 risk of metabolic acidosis.</p><p>the same types of undesirable effects that are attributable to sulphonamides 
 may occur with topical administration.</p><p>if signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue 
 the use of this preparation.</p><p>
 there is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition 
 in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and azopt.</p><p>the concomitant administration of 
 azopt and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not recommended.</p><p>
 there is limited experience with azopt in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or 
 pigmentary glaucoma. 
 azopt was primarily evaluated in concomitant administration with timolol during adjunctive glaucoma 
 therapy.</p><p>additionally the iop-reducing effect of azopt as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin 
 analogue travoprost has been studied. no long term data are available on the use of azopt as adjunctive 
 therapy to travoprost.(see section 5.1)</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>
 the possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients 
 with compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count).</p><p>specifically, patients 
 wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when using 
 brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration and 
 wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea.</p><p>likewise, in other cases of compromised 
 corneas such as patients with diabetes mellitus, careful monitoring is recommended. 
 4</p><p>
 benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy.</p><p>since azopt contains 
 benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients, or 
 in conditions where the cornea is compromised.</p><p>
 azopt has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses.</p><p>azopt contains the preservative 
 benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation.</p><p>benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft 
 contact lenses and is known to discolour soft contact lenses.</p><p>therefore, patients must be instructed to wait 
 15 minutes after instillation of azopt before inserting contact lenses.</p><p>azopt must not be administered 
 while wearing contact lenses.</p><p>
 potential rebound effects following cessation of treatment with azopt have not been studied; the 
 iop-lowering effect is expected to last for 5-7 days.</p><p>
 oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness 
 and/or physical coordination in elderly patients.</p><p>azopt is absorbed systemically and therefore this may 
 occur with topical administration.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>specific interaction studies with other medicinal products have not been performed with azopt.</p><p>in clinical studies, azopt was used concomitantly with prostaglandin analogues and timolol ophthalmic 
 preparations without evidence of adverse interactions.</p><p>association between azopt and miotics or 
 adrenergic agonists has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.</p><p>
 azopt is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. 
 acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</p><p>the potential for 
 interactions must be considered in patients receiving azopt.</p><p>
 the cytochrome p-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include cyp3a4 (main), 
 cyp2a6, cyp2c8 and cyp2c9.</p><p>it is expected that inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ketoconazole, 
 itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide by 
 cyp3a4.</p><p>caution is advised if cyp3a4 inhibitors are given concomitantly.</p><p>however, accumulation of 
 brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route.</p><p>brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of 
 cytochrome p-450 isozymes.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no adequate data from the use of brinzolamide in pregnant women.</p><p>studies in animals have 
 shown reproductive toxicity (see 5.3).</p><p>the potential risk for humans is unknown.</p><p>azopt should not be 
 used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.</p><p>
 nursing mothers 
 it is not known whether brinzolamide is excreted in human milk, however, this substance is excreted in rat 
 milk.</p><p>it is strongly recommended to avoid the use of azopt when breast-feeding. 
 5</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances, may affect the ability to drive or use machines (see also 4.8 undesirable effects).</p><p>if blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision 
 clears before driving or using machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>in clinical studies involving over 1800 patients treated with azopt as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 5 mg/ml, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were: dysgeusia 
 (5.8%) (bitter or unusual taste, see description below) and temporary blurred vision (5.8%) upon 
 instillation, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes (see also 4.7 effects on ability to drive and use 
 machines).</p><p>

 in small short-term clinical trials, approximately 12.5% of paediatric patients were observed to experience 
 drug related adverse effects, the majority of which were local, nonserious ocular effects such as 
 conjunctival hyperaemia, eye irritation, eye discharge, and lacrimation increased (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 dysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) was the most frequently reported 
 systemic undesirable effect associated with the use of azopt during clinical studies.</p><p>it is likely caused 
 by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal.</p><p>nasolacrimal occlusion or 
 gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the incidence of this effect (see 
 also 4.2 posology and method of administration).</p><p>
 azopt is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption.</p><p>gastrointestinal, 
 nervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are generally associated with systemic 
 carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</p><p>the same type of undesirable effects that are attributable to oral carbonic 
 anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration.</p><p>
 no unexpected adverse events have been observed with azopt when used as adjunctive therapy to 
 travoprost. the adverse events seen with the adjunctive therapy have been observed with each active 
 substance alone.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>no case of overdose has been reported.</p><p>
 treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p><p>electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic 
 state, and possible nervous system effects may occur.</p><p>serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) 
 and blood ph levels must be monitored.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</p><p>
 atc code: s01ec</p><p>
 carbonic anhydrase (ca) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye.</p><p>carbonic 
 anhydrase catalyses the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration 
 of carbonic acid.</p><p>
 inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour secretion, 
 presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid 
 transport.</p><p>the result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (iop) which is a major risk factor in the 
 pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss.</p><p>brinzolamide, an inhibitor of 
 carbonic anhydrase ii (ca-ii), the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye, with an 
 in vitro ic50 of 3.2 nm and a k
 i of 0.13 nm against ca-ii. 8</p><p>
 the iop-reducing effect of azopt as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin analogue travoprost was studied. following a 4 week run-in with travoprost, patients with an iop ≥19 mmhg were randomized to 
 receive added treatment with brinzolamide or timolol. an additional decrease in mean diurnal iop of 
 3.2 to 3.4 mmhg for the brinzolamide group and 3.2 to 4.2 mmhg for the timolol group were observed. 
 there was an overall higher incidence of non-serious ocular adverse events, mainly related to signs of 
 local irritation, in the brinzolamide/travoprost groups. the events were mild and did not affect the overall 
 discontinuation rates in the studies (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 a clinical trial was conducted with azopt in 32 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age, diagnosed 
 with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</p><p>some patients were naive to iop therapy whilst others were on 
 other iop-lowering medicinal product(s).</p><p>those who had been on previous iop medicinal products were 
 not required to discontinue their iop medicinal product(s) until initiation of monotherapy with azopt. 
 among patients who were naive to iop therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of azopt was similar to that 
 seen previously in adults, with mean iop reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmhg.</p><p>among 
 patients who were on topical iop-lowering medicinal products (22 patients), mean iop increased slightly 
 from baseline in the azopt group.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation.</p><p>due to its high affinity for ca-ii, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the rbcs and exhibits a long halflife in 
 whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks).</p><p>in humans, the metabolite n-desethylbrinzolamide is 
 formed, which also binds to ca and accumulates in rbcs.</p><p>this metabolite binds mainly to ca-i in the 
 presence of brinzolamide.</p><p>in plasma, both brinzolamide and n-desethylbrinzolamide concentrations are 
 low and generally below assay quantitation limits (&lt;7.5 ng/ml).</p><p>
 binding to plasma proteins is not extensive (about 60%).</p><p>brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal 
 excretion (approximately 60%).</p><p>about 20% of the dose has been accounted for in urine as metabolite. 
 brinzolamide and n-desethyl-brinzolamide are the predominant components in the urine along with trace 
 levels of the n-desmethoxypropyl and o-desmethyl metabolites.</p><p>
 in an oral pharmacokinetic study, healthy volunteers received 1 mg capsules of brinzolamide twice daily 
 for up to 32 weeks and rbc ca activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic ca inhibition.</p><p>
 brinzolamide saturation of rbc ca-ii was achieved within 4 weeks (rbc concentrations of 
 approximately 20 µm). n-desethyl-brinzolamide accumulated in rbcs to steady state within 
 20-28 weeks reaching concentrations ranging from 6-30 µm.</p><p>the inhibition of total rbc ca activity at 
 steady state was approximately 70-75%.</p><p>
 subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/minute) were administered 
 1 mg of brinzolamide twice daily orally for up to 54 weeks.</p><p>brinzolamide rbc concentration ranged 
 from about 20 to 40 µm by week 4 of treatment.</p><p>at steady-state, brinzolamide and its metabolite rbc 
 concentrations ranged from 22.0 to 46.1 and 17.1 to 88.6 µm, respectively.</p><p>
 n-desethyl-brinzolamide rbc concentrations increased and total rbc ca activity decreased with 
 decreasing creatinine clearance but brinzolamide rbc concentrations and ca-ii activity remained 
 unchanged.</p><p>in subjects with the highest degree of renal impairment inhibition of total ca activity was 
 greater although it was inferior to 90% at steady-state.</p><p>
 in a topical ocular study, at steady-state, brinzolamide rbc concentrations were similar to those found in 
 the oral study, but levels of n-desethyl-brinzolamide were lower.</p><p>carbonic anhydrase activity was 
 approximately 40-70% of predose levels. 
 9</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>topical ocular administration of brinzolamide to rabbits for one to six months resulted in slight, statistically significant increases in corneal thickness when given at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4%, 
 four times a day; these changes were not observed in other species.</p><p>chronic administration of 
 brinzolamide to rats at a dose level of 8 mg/kg/day (up to 250 times the recommended human ophthalmic 
 dose) resulted in changes associated with the pharmacology of carbonic anhydrase inhibition (i.e., urine 
 volume and electrolyte changes, slight differences in serum electrolytes).</p><p>
 a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours was observed in female mice given 
 brinzolamide 10 mg/kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose), orally, for 24 months.</p><p>
 dose-related proliferative changes in the urinary bladder were observed among female mice at 1, 3 and 
 10 mg/kg/day, and among males at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. the elevated bladder tumour incidence, which 
 was statistically significant, was primarily due to the increased incidence of a tumour considered unique to 
 mice.</p><p>
 developmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day (125 times 
 the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed no effect on foetal development despite significant 
 maternal toxicity. similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of skull and sternebrae of 
 foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg/kg/day (375 times the recommended human 
 ophthalmic dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day.</p><p>these findings occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis 
 with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights.</p><p>dose-related decreases in foetal 
 weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally ranging from a slight decrease 
 (about 5-6%) at 2 mg/kg/day to nearly 14% at 18 mg/kg/day.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>benzalkonium chloride, mannitol,

 azopt is one of a group of medicines</header><p>for glaucoma called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. it works by cutting down the production of liquid, which lowers the pressure in the eye. it may be used on its own or 
 with other drops called beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues, which also reduce pressure.</p></section><section><header>azopt eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye.</header><p> this pressure can lead to an illness called</p></section><section><header>glaucoma.  high pressure in the eye.</header><p>your eyeballs contain a clear, watery liquid which feeds the inside of the eye. liquid is always emptying out of the eye, and more liquid is always being produced.</p><p>if the eye fills up 
 faster than it empties, the pressure inside the eye builds up.</p><p>if it gets too high it can damage your sight.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use azopt

 how much to use 
 &lt; see side 1</p><p>
 • get the azopt bottle and a mirror • wash your hands • shake the bottle and twist off the cap</p><p>• hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and middle finger • tilt your head back. pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your eye. the drop will go in here (picture 1) 
 • bring the bottle tip close to the eye. use the mirror if it helps •</p></section><section><header>don’t touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper.</header><p> it could infect the drops 
 • gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of azopt at a time.</p><p>•</p></section><section><header>don’t squeeze the bottle:</header><p>it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs (picture 2) 
 • after using azopt, press a finger to the corner of your eye, by the nose (picture 3) . this helps to stop azopt getting into the rest of the body. 
 • if you take drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. • put the bottle cap back on firmly immediately after use • use up one bottle before opening the next bottle.</p></section><section><header>if a drop misses your eye</header><p>, try again.</p></section><section><header>if you get too much in your eyes,</header><p> rinse it all out with warm water.</p><p>don’t put in any more drops until it’s time for your next regular dose.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to use azopt,</header><p> use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine.</p></section><section><header>do not</header><p> use a double dose to make up.</p><p>
 if you stop using azopt without speaking to your doctor, the pressure in your eye will not be controlled 
 which could lead to loss of sight.</p></section><section><header>if you are using other eye drops,</header><p>leave at least 5 minutes between putting in azopt and the other drops.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, azopt can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.</p><p>
