 emea 2005</header></section><section><header>scientific discussion  this module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of faslodex. for 
 information on changes after approval please refer to module 8. 
   1. 
 introduction</header><p>this marketing authorization application concerns faslodex, solution for injection 250 mg/5ml, which contains the active substance fulvestrant (ici 182,780, zd9238). this is a full application for approval 
 of a new active substance. the therapeutic indication for faslodex is for the treatment of 
 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
 for disease relapse on or after adjuvant antioestrogen therapy or disease progression on therapy with 
 an antioestrogen. the proposed dose is 250 mg to be administered intramuscularly into the buttock at 
 intervals of 1 month as a single 5 ml injection. 
 breast cancer breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women with as many as one in eight women in developed countries being affected by the disease at some point during their lifetime. the aging 
 population is set to give rise to an increase in the prevalence of breast cancer with estimates suggesting 
 an annual rise of 1%, particularly among postmenopausal women. 
 treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. early or localized breast cancer 
 is treated by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. adjuvant systemic therapy, consisting of 
 chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, in tumours deemed hormone responsive, can prolong the 
 disease-free interval and improve overall survival. however, approximately 30% to 40% of patients 
 with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse, with either local recurrence or distant metastases, and 
 require further systemic treatment for advanced disease (ref: forbes 1997).</p><p>since breast cancer that 
 recurs or progresses after initial treatment is considered incurable, the therapy options available for 
 advanced disease are concerned with disease control and palliation of symptoms (ref: osborne, 1998). 
 hormonal therapy has become the treatment of choice in postmenopausal women with hormone 
 sensitive breast cancer. historically, the selective oestrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen has been 
 used extensively with success to treat advanced disease (ref: litherland and jackson, 1988; osborne, 
 1998). resistance to tamoxifen develops and the mechanism is complex. for postmenopausal women 
 with breast cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed following treatment with tamoxifen or 
 related non-steroidal anti-oestrogen, the choice of additional hormonal treatment lies between 
 aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, examestane, letrozole) and progestins (eg, megestrol acetate, 
 medroxyprogesterone). progestins can be poorly tolerated because of adverse effects, notably weight 
 gain, oedema, and thromboembolic complications.</p><p>as a result, progestins are often reserved as third-
 line treatment or are avoided if the patient is deemed at risk of these complications. even though the 
 treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women has improved with the introduction of 
 agents such as aromatase inhibitors, these agents still have limitations, and disease management 
 continues to be sub-optimal. 
 about the product fulvestrant is claimed to be the first agent in a new class of anti-oestrogen described by the term oestrogen receptor downregulator (er downregulator [ref: wakeling, 2000]). it is an anti-oestrogen 
 without agonist properties. it blocks the trophic actions of oestrogens without itself having any partial 
 agonist (oestrogen-like) activity on the endometrium of post-menopausal women. fulvestrant binds to 
 oestrogen receptors (ers) in a competitive manner with a high affinity comparable with that of 
 oestradiol. data from pre-clinical studies have shown that fulvestrant is effective against human breast 
 cancer cells and xenografts displaying acquired resistance to tamoxifen or letrozole</p><p>(ref: osborne et 
 al, 1994, 1995; long et al, 2002).</p><p>a lack of significant issues from single and multiple dose safety 
 studies in animals indicates a potential for a good safety profile. these data have provided a rationale 
 for clinical development of fulvestrant in breast cancer patients whose disease has recurred or 
 progressed following endocrine treatment.</p><p>

 emea 2005 faslodex is presented as a sterile oily solution in a 5 ml pre-filled syringe. it is a long acting (la) injection, designed to deliver the required dose of 250 mg of fulvestrant over a 1 month period from a 
 single intramuscular injection into the buttock.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
  
 composition</header><p>faslodex is presented as a sterile oily solution for intramuscular injection containing 50 mg/ml of the active substance fulvestrant. other ingredients include ethanol, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate and 
 castor oil. 
 faslodex is packaged in a single use pre-filled syringe consisting of a siliconised type i glass barrel 
 fitted with a tamper evident closure/luer lock connector, a siliconised bromobutyl rubber plunger, a 
 bromobutyl/synthetic isoprene rubber tip-cap, a polystyrene plunger rod and a polypropylene back 
 stop. each pre-filled syringe is enclosed in a black line carton to provide light protection.</p></section><section><header>active substance</header><p>the chemical name of fulvestrant is 7α-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl) -nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17
 β-diol. it is is a white crystalline solid compound with very high lipophilicity and extremely low aqueous solubility; it does not ionise except at very high ph. the compound is stable to 
 hydrolysis, but has some susceptibility to oxidation. it contains 6 asymmetric carbon atoms and a 
 stereogenic sulphoxide in the side chain. the active ingredient is a mixture of 2 diastereoisomers: 
 fulvestrant sulphoxide a and b, having the same absolute configuration at each of the stereogenic 
 centres in the steroid system but different absolute configurations at the sulphur atom. the ratio of 
 fulvestrant sulphoxide a : fulvestrant sulphoxide b in fulvestrant is controlled by the clause for 
 optical purity by hplc. 
 the synthesis of fulvestrant is a 6-stage process, which will give a mixture of the two diastereoisomers 
 (fulvestrant sulphoxide a and b), whose ratio is tightly controlled by hplc.</p><p>the route of synthesis 
 has been sufficiently described, and the major steps in the synthesis of fulvestrant are adequately 
 controlled during the reaction.</p><p>
 there are thirty-four potential synthetic and degradation impurities, which may arise from the route of 
 synthesis. only 13 of these impurities have been detected in batches of fulvestrant during 
 development. the presence or absence of impurities has been examined by spectroscopy and/or 
 chromatography in all batches used in toxicological or clinical studies.</p><p>
 active substance specification 
 the specification of the active substance includes tests for description, identification (ir), assay 
 (hplc), organic impurities (hplc), residual solvents (gc), optical purity (hplc), water content 
 (karl fischer titration), sulphated ash, microbial content and endotoxins (lal). 
 the limits for the identified and unidentified but specified impurities are justified by toxicological and 
 stability studies. batch analysis data have been provided for 23 batches of fulvestrant. the analytical 
 results for these batches comply with the proposed specification.</p><p>
 in conclusion it has been proven that the tests and limits in the specification are appropriate for 
 controlling the quality of the active substance.</p></section><section><header>stability</header><p>stability studies have been performed on 6 batches of fulvestrant in accordance with ich guidelines. samples were stored at 25 
 oc/ 60% rh for up to 36 months, 30 oc/ 60 and 80% rh for 12 months and 40 
 oc/ 75% rh for 6 months. additional sudies were performed for six months under thermal stress (50 and 60
 oc) and humidity stress conditions (50 and 60 oc/ 80% rh). the parameters tested are description, assay, organic impurities (hplc), degradation products (tlc), 
 specific optical rotation, optical purity, water content, appearance, colour and clarity of solution and 
 melting point. the methods used are the same as those used for routine control of fulvestrant with the 
 3/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 addition of tlc as a complementary technique to hplc for detection of degradation products. all methods employed were stability indicating. 
 all parameters evaluated comply with the active substance specification. the stability data presented 
 support the proposed re-tests period for fulvestrant, when stored in a double polythene liner inside an 
 aluminium foil lined fibreboard drum under the specified conditions.</p></section><section><header>other ingredients</header><p>all materials used are of non-animal origin.</p><p>ethanol, benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate comply with the eur. ph. requirements. the castor oil complies with usp. 
 product development and finished product 
 as already discussed the active ingredient is a mixture of two diastereoisomers. the use of the mixture 
 of these diastereroisomers is justified from the fact that the manufacture of individual diastereoisomers 
 is not practical, their ratio is consistent, adequately controlled and does not change during storage 
 neither in the drug substance or the drug product nor 
 in vivo and the individual diastereoisomers have similar pharmacological potency. 
 oral delivery has been explored, but this route could not achieve adequate bioavailability. faslodex 
 has therefore been developed for administration by intramuscular injection.</p><p> 
 the goal of the development was to achieve effective and convenient delivery of fulvestrant, using the 
 formulation to control the rate of drug input and reduce the frequency of administration. achievement 
 of drug solution at the target formulation concentration of 50 mg/ml is the key of this formulation 
 approach. studies were carried out to measure fulvestrant solubility in a range of oils, esters and 
 alcohols suitable for inclusion in intramuscular injection formulations. it was found that castor oil 
 together with co-solvent (benzyl alcohol, ethanol and benzyl benzoate) were the most suitable to allow 
 a fulvestrant concentration of 50 mg/ml. 
 the manufacturing process for the finished product follows conventional pharmaceutical practices, 
 which include a solution compounding step, sterile filtration and aseptic filling into syringes followed 
 by stoppering.</p><p>processing is carried out under an inert gas (nitrogen) overlay, which has been shown 
 to minimize formation of the oxidative degradation product fulvestrant sulphone.</p><p>sterility is assured 
 by means of sterilisation by filtration and aseptic processing, as terminal sterilisation by heat or 
 irradiation has been shown to be unsuitable for this product. the critical parameters were identified 
 during development and the manufacturing process has been optimised to ensure control of 
 degradation products and co-solvent levels. 
 the process validation of faslodex 50 mg/ml solution for injection has been performed on three 
 commercial batches having the same composition and method of manufacture as the proposed 
 commercial formulation. the process validation criteria were met in all cases and all samples met the 
 pre-defined acceptance criteria.</p><p>
 the batches used in the clinical studies have the same formulation as the product intended for the 
 market.</p></section><section><header>product specification</header><p>the product specifications include tests by validated methods for the description, assay (hplc), identification (ir), degradation products (hplc), sterility, endotoxins (lal), pre-filled syringe 
 function test, residual solvents (gc) and volume of injection in containers. 
 the specification and control tests applied for the finished product at time of release and throughout 
 the life of the product, are in compliance with pharmacopoeial standards (including ph eur) and ich 
 guidelines.</p><p>the limits for each specification test are supported by data derived from toxicological, 
 biopharmaceutical, and stability studies.</p><p> 
 batch analysis data from 4 pilot and 4 production scale batches of the finished product have been 
 provided. all batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology 
 valid at the time of batch release.</p><p>
 4/33</p><p>
 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>three primary batches and three supporting batches of faslodex have been subjected to stability studies using a range of stability conditions: long term (5 
 oc) for up to 36 months, accelerated (30 oc/ 60% rh), thermal stress (30 
 oc/ 60% rh and 50 oc) for up to 6 months, humidity stress (30 oc/ 80% rh and 40 
 oc/ 75% rh) and accelerated (25 oc/ 60% rh) for up to 12 months. two of the batches have also been placed under light stress testing according to ich guidelines. 
 the parameters studied were description, volume of injection in containers, sterility, degree of 
 coloration of liquid, average weight change, viscosity, assay, degradation products, residual solvents, 
 the content of free fatty acids, water content and optical purity. the tests performed are the same as 
 those used for the release of faslodex. 
 based on the results of the above-mentioned studies it has been concluded that the proposed shelf life 
 for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the spc is acceptable.</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects.</header><p>the quality of faslodex is is adequately established. in general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. there are no major 
 deviations from eu and ich requirements. 
 the active substance is a mixture of two diastereoisomeers with consistent ratio and similar 
 pharmacological activity. it is stable, well characterised and documented. the excipents have been 
 chosen to control the rate of drug input and reduce the frequency of administration.</p><p>the packaging 
 material is commonly used and well documented. the manufacturing process of the finished product 
 has been adequately described. 
 stability tests indicate that the product under ich guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the 
 proposed shelf life.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. toxico-pharmacological aspects 
  pharmacology</header><p>fulvestrant is a competitive inhibitor of oestradiol binding to the oestrogen receptor (er) with an ic50 value of 9.35 x 10-9m. the relative binding affinity to the oestrogen receptor is approximately similar for oestradiol (rba=1) and fulvestrant (rba=0.89), and 35 times lower for tamoxifen (rba=0.025). 
 multiple changes in er function in the fulvestrant-er complex contribute to the blockade of 
 oestrogen action. these changes include impaired receptor dimerisation, disrupted nuclear 
 localisation, an increased rate of receptor degradation, impaired dna binding and inactivation of 
 activation functions af1 and af2. increased receptor degradation leading to the rapid loss of er 
 following treatment with fulvestrant occurs in breast cancer cells in culture, in the uterus after 
 in vivo treatment and in human breast tumours. hence, the drug’s mode of action appears to lead to downregulation of oestrogen receptor protein. the mode of action on the molecular level thus seem to 
 differ from that of tamoxifen and oestradiol which bind with high affinity to the er and displaces 
 receptor associated proteins. however, the clinical relevance i.e. in terms of efficacy, of this difference 
 in mode of action is not clear and has to be investigated in patients. it should be emphasised that this 
 discussion involves er
 α, while no data is available concerning an eventual interaction between fulvestrant and er
 β. as to date it seems that there is no clear picture about the role of erβ in breast cancer. according to one reference (fugua et al 2003) er
 β could serve as an independent marker for malignacy, for instance, the rate of aneuploidy was marginally higher in er
 α negative/erβ positive breast cancer samples suggesting that er
 β positive breast cancers might be more aggressive than other receptor types. it may be speculated that the er
 β could serve as a marker of endocrine therapy resistance. sub-typing studies have not been carried out but would be welcomed in prospective 
 studies.</p><p>
 fulvestrant is a reversible inhibitor of the growth of oestrogen-sensitive human breast cancer (mcf-7) 
 cells and tamoxifen-resistant mcf-7 cells 
 in vitro. at maximum effect, fulvestrant induced a 80% 5/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 reduction in number of mcf-7 cells, whereas tamoxifen induced a 50% reduction in cell number. the applicant cites studies showing that tamoxifen-resistant cells remain sensitive to the growth inhibitory 
 effect of fulvestrant, whereas fulvestrant-resistant cells are cross-resistant to tamoxifen. hence, 
 tumors, which have relapsed during fulvestrant treatment, may not respond to treatment with 
 tamoxifen, and this treatment sequence can not be recommended based on non-clinical data.</p><p>
 moreover, fulvestrant prevents the establishment of tumors from xenografts of human breast cancer 
 cells in nude mice 
 in vivo. the efficacy of fulvestrant (single 5 mg s.c. injection) in preventing the growth of tumors from grafts of mcf-7 cells after 4 weeks was comparable to that seen in mice 
 treated daily with a high dose of tamoxifen (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 8 weeks.</p><p>
 fulvestrant is a non-agonist antioestrogen that blocks the uterotrophic action of oestradiol in mice, rats 
 and monkeys without having significant partial agonist oestrogen-like activity. hence, no adverse 
 effects on the uterus endometrium, or on development of resistance due to agonist effects on the 
 tumour, can be anticipated from the non-clinical data. in monkeys, measurements of plasma 
 fulvestrant showed that inhibition of the trophic effects of oestradiol required drug concentrations in 
 the range 1-2 ng or greater. extrapolation of this data to humans predicts a monthly i.m. injection of 
 200 to 300 mg of fulvestrant, which is line with the dose proposed for marketing (250 mg).</p><p>
 fulvestrant is a racemate showing similar potency as the individual enantiomers in three 
 pharmacodynamic assays. none of the 4 metabolites tested showed any oestrogenic activity. the 17-
 ketone showed antioestrogenic activity 4-5 fold less potent than fulvestrant.</p><p>
 to conclude, the non-clinical data presented, both 
 in vitro and in vivo, in animal species considered relevant for pharmacodynamic studies, is consistent with the compound having efficacy in the 
 proposed indication of treatment of advanced breast cancer in women whose disease has progressed 
 following endocrine therapy.</p><p>
 limited studies did not indicate any significant secondary pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant. no 
 interactions with histamine h
 2 receptor, β1, β2 adrenoreceptors, 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 receptors were reported, but a weak non-competitive inhibition of responses mediated by muscarinic, histamine h
 1 and adrenergic α1 receptors was observed. safety pharmacology studies (see also section on toxicology) in male animals addressed possible effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, 
 respiratory, renal and gastrointestinal systems. potential interactions with the cardiovascular system 
 were assessed in studies in dog and 
 in vitro in sheep purkinje fibres stimulated at 1 hz, models and study conditions that can be expected to be relatively insensitive to potential effects. no statistically 
 significant effects were observed. no marked effects of fulvestrant with regard to the cns were 
 reported. however, in rats fulvestrant was shown to increase locomotor activity, the relevance of this 
 observation is unclear.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>no issues concerning the two diastereomers, sulphoxide a and sulphoxide b that represent fulvestrant in a 45:55 ratio have been identified. studies indicate these do not undergo interconversion and 
 disposition appears achiral. fulvestrant has a low oral bioavailability. absorption after intramuscular 
 doses is good and distribution is wide. the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were studied using a short-
 acting (sa) formulation and the long-acting (la) formulation. only the long-acting formulation is 
 intended for clinical use.</p><p>
 fulvestrant did neither inhibit cyp450 enzymes nor act as an enzyme inducer. fulvestrant was 
 extensively metabolised with sulphate, glucuronide and ketosulphone derivatives identified as primary 
 metabolites in all species. metabolism appears complex. after intramuscular injections in rat the 
 metabolism involved oxidation, hydroxylation and conjugation reactions. oxidative metabolism at c-2 
 and c-4 position of the a-ring and at the c-17 was suggested to produce a ketone while a similar 
 reaction at the sulphoxide was proposed to produce a sulphone. parent compound and some 
 metabolites were conjugated at c-2, c-3 and c-4 positions to produce glucuronides and sulphates. the 
 17-keto compound had pharmacological activity lower than the parent compound while other putative 
 6/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 metabolites tested had no oestrogenic activity. overall the metabolite profile appeared comparable qualitatively across species.</p><p>
 fulvestrant is highly protein bound in all species with 98.83% binding using human plasma, indicating 
 a potential for drug displacement interactions. 
 in vitro fulvestrant demonstrates non-physiological binding properties and interactions based on displacement do not seem readily studied 
 in vitro. in both the albino and pigmented rat, rapid and extensive distribution was evident with highest levels detected 
 in liver, mesenteric lymph nodes and kidney. distribution into the cns and the spinal cord seemed 
 limited with the protocol used, a single intramuscular dose of fulvestrant in the sa-formulation. 
 fulvestrant passes into the milk of lactating rats and crosses the placenta after intramuscular injections 
 in rat and rabbit.</p><p>
 possible interference with p-gp or any other clinically relevant transporter system (bsep, mrps) has 
 been discussed. fulvestrant is not currently indicated for co-administration with other anticancer 
 agents known to be p-gp substrates or inhibitors. if such developmental programme will be established 
 these potential interactions should be resolved. in non-clinical studies some signals of hepatotoxicity 
 were observed in rat, dog and monkey studies. although the drug is administered via intramuscular 
 injections it may interfere with different transport proteins and compete with excretion of other exo-
 /endogenous compounds.</p><p>
 in all species, including humans, the primary excretion route is faecal with less than 2% of label found 
 in urine. elimination appeared more rapid in rat than in dog and the apparent long elimination half-life 
 was probably due to slow absorption from the injection site.</p><p>
 in rat, day 1 and day 28 auc values were comparable after daily doses of the sa-formulation. no 
 gender differences were apparent when using the ria assay. in a 6- month rat study using the la-
 formulation and the hplc assay, higher auc values were reported after multiple doses than after 
 single doses. there were indications that female rats achieved a higher exposure than males using the 
 la-formulation and intramuscular injection. in dog, daily intramuscular injections of the sa-
 formulation as well as monthly injections of the la-formulation resulted in accumulation as 
 determined by auc values. limited data in the dog did not indicate any significant gender differences 
 in exposure.</p><p>
 the systemic exposure and c
 max in various toxicity studies exhibited significant variations despite similar doses being used. this was partly explained by different analytical methods (lsc ria and a 
 hplc ms-ms). other data indicated very marked interindividual variations in plasma levels after 
 intramuscular doses, e.g. c
 max levels were 15.5, 38.5 and 135 in three dogs all treated with a single dose of 2 mg/kg. notwithstanding uncertainties with respect to specificity of the ria-assay and the 
 origin of some of the great interindividual variations in plasma levels, that could partly be explained 
 by differences in absorption from the injection sites, it can overall be accepted that sufficient exposure 
 was achieved in the pivotal toxicity studies. for the la-formulation the highest dose levels used (10 
 mg/rat/15 days) and dog (40 mg/kg/28 days) corresponded to exposure ratios of x4-10 the expected 
 human maximal dose (250 mg/month).</p><p>
 the data indicate overall that from the pharmacokinetic point of view the species used in preclinical 
 studies are valid models to study the toxicological profile of the compound.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>the potential of fulvestrant to cause local or systemic toxic reactions when administered by the intramuscular route was investigated in toxicity studies in rat and dog of up to 12 months duration. in 
 addition studies in mouse, rat, dog and monkey are available to assess the potential of fulvestrant to 
 cause pathological effects when administered by oral, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. most of the 
 studies included saline and vehicle controls and the long-acting (la) formulation intended for clinical 
 use, was used in the main pivotal toxicity studies. the la-formulation was composed of fulvestrant 
 (5% w/v), ethanol (10% w/v), benzyl alcohol (10% w/v), benzyl benzoate (15% w/v) and castor oil to 
 100. the pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies used the intramuscular route and included 1 and 6 
 7/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 month rat studies given total doses of up to 120 mg/rat in a 6-month period. the dog represented the non-rodent species and the highest dose given in the pivotal 12-month study was 40mg/kg/28 days. 
 the maximum doses were limited by solution characteristics of the formulation and the maximum 
 volume that could possibly be administered by the intramuscular route. the selection of the high dose 
 was justified and corresponded to approximately x8 (dog) and x40 (rat) on a monthly dose basis, or 
 approximately x4-11 on a systemic exposure basis. the studies are overall considered sufficient for 
 evaluation of the toxicological profile of fulvestrant. 
 safety pharmacology studies (see also section on pharmacology) indicated a limited potential of 
 fulvestrant to interfere with the function of major organ systems. the studies all used male animals 
 and addressed possible effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, renal and 
 gastrointestinal system. locomotor activity in male rats was increased by intramuscular doses of 20 
 mg/kg, the relevance of which is unclear. single dose pharmacokinetic studies indicated very limited 
 passage into the cns using the sa-formulation. however, there were some indications in repeated 
 dose toxicity studies such as pituitary effects that suggest fulvestrant and/or metabolites have the 
 capacity to either directly or by secondary hormonal activity, interact with the cns. in the literature it 
 is reported that fulvestrant may have effects on the brain such that the effect of oestrogens is blocked 
 in the hippocampus, but not in the frontal cortex. further, neuroprotective effects of oestradiol were 
 blocked by fulvestrant in a model of stroke-like ischemic injury in female rats. in view of the proposed 
 new principle of action and in case of future extended indications it would be of interest to clarify the 
 potential effects of fulvestrant on the central nervous system based on known, expected hormonal 
 actions.</p><p>
 myocardium is a target tissue for oestrogens. potential interactions with the cardiovascular system 
 were assessed in studies in the dog and 
 in vitro in sheep purkinje fibres stimulated at 1 hz. no statistically significant effects of fulvestrant doses up to 20 mg/kg (la-formulation) in anaesthetized 
 dogs monitored up to 120 minutes post-dose, were observed. heart rate was somewhat increased. in 
 an 
 in vitro study in sheep purkinje fibres stimulated at 1 hz, no effects on qt intervals was reported. both test systems and study conditions can be expected to be relatively insensitive to potential effects. 
 in an intravenous tolerance study in dogs there was evidence of transient cardiovascular effects and 
 clinical signs of panting and flushing were recorded. ecg measurements in the 12-month dog study 
 did not show any effects. it is reported in literature data that fulvestrant can block the inhibitory effect 
 of oestradiol at concentrations that inhibit oestradiol metabolism to precursors of methoxyoestradiols 
 on human coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. fulvestrant has been shown to activate large 
 conductance ca(2+) activated k(+) (bk(ca)) channels in smooth muscle cells further suggesting 
 potential for interactions on the vascular level. further retrospective characterisation with respect to 
 the cardiovascular system is not warranted in the context of the present application concerning 
 treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</p><p>
 toxicity studies with repeated administration indicate that with the possible exception of effects on the 
 kidney, apparently restricted to males, adverse effects could mainly be attributed to the 
 pharmacological activity. increased kidney weights and vacuolation was noted in male mice and an 
 increased incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy was reported in male rats in the 2-year 
 carcinogenicity study. in the event of an extended use these changes should be further evaluated as to 
 the mode of action. moreover, in the 12- month study in dogs, 6 animals were stated to have arteritis</p></section><section><header>(</header><p>or vasculitis</p></section><section><header>)</header><p>, considered unrelated to treatment, affecting a variety of organs. the applicant has discussed the reasons why arteritis was not considered related to treatment, and attributed changes as 
 related to an underlying disorder, precipitated by treatment and specific for the strain of beagle dogs 
 used. in the 6 month study the incidence of arteritis did not seem increased in treated dogs while in the 
 12 month study lesions in the urinary bladder vessels affected 3 of 6 dogs with arteritis or vasculitis. 
 although arteritis might not be a specific drug induced effect, a treatment related effect can not be 
 excluded. the potential of fulvestrant to exacerbate or induce these kinds of changes is likely a late 
 effect with doubtful significance for the general safety profile of the compound in the present 
 indication.</p><p>
 a high dose female dog in the 12-month study was noted for multifocal hepatic granuloma. in other 
 studies occasional decreases in spleen weight was observed possibly secondary to anti-oestrogenic 
 pharmacology and indicative of immunological effects. there are theoretical mechanisms for 
 8/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 immunotoxicity due to fulvestrant, but these likely are not relevant for the target population. it is accepted that immunotoxicology studies are not conducted but in case of future extended indications 
 these issues might be reconsidered.</p><p>fulvestrant had no antigenic potential in studies in guinea-pig and 
 mouse.</p><p>
 histopathological changes related to treatment with fulvestrant were recorded in the uterus (uterine 
 atrophy affecting endometrium and myometrium), cervix (atrophy, increased stromal density), vagina 
 (atrophy, increased stromal density and organ reduced in size), ovaries (disturbance in the maturation 
 of the graafian follicle, formation of follicular cysts, degenerate corpora lutea, cystic and 
 haemorrhagic), adrenal glands (atrophy in males, zona fasciculata of the cortex), and pituitary gland 
 (atrophy, increase in the number of castration cells). these effects seemed primarily related to the 
 pharmacologic activity of fulvestrant. the increase in red blood cell parameters recorded in some 
 studies in females likely also as suggested was related to the anti-oestrogenic activity. in the majority 
 of toxicity studies a no effect level could not be established, but effects recorded were mostly local 
 reactions or changes related to the pharmacological activity of the compound. the applicant suggests 
 that fulvestrant has no effect on bone density at relevant doses in rat. 
 in vitro studies reported in the literature have shown that fulvestrant may reverse oestrogen-induced expression of proteins central to 
 osteoclast formation and function. however, fulvestrant did not impair the long-term bone-protective 
 effects of testosterone in young orchidectomized male rats.</p><p>
 the local tolerance of fulvestrant (5% w/v) was studied in rabbit and dog. local reactions were 
 dependent on the vehicle used, but severity and frequency increased with increasing concentrations of 
 fulvestrant. adverse local reactions appeared dependent also on species, site of administration and 
 frequency of administration. in rat 1 and 6 month studies injection site fibrosis was evident.</p><p>in the 2-
 year rat carcinogenicity study changes consisted of local inflammation, plantar epithelial ulceration 
 and multiple cysts at times associated with mild local inflammation and degeneration or atrophy of 
 skeletal muscle. in the 6-month dog study myositis, present also after a 6-month withdrawal period, 
 and necrosis was evident. in the 12 month dog study changes at the injections site were described as 
 &quot;multifocal inter and intrafasicular granulomatous foreign body response.&quot;</p><p>
 fulvestrant was evaluated for genotoxic activity in the ames test, the mouse lymphoma test, in the 
 chromosomal aberration test using human lymphocytes and in the rat micronucleus test after a single 
 oral dose of 2000 mg/kg.</p><p>all tests were negative for genotoxic potential. in a 2-year rat 
 carcinogenicity study an increase in the incidence of ovarian granulosa cell tumours in females and in 
 leydig cell tumours in low and mid dose males were observed. the incidence of mammary gland and 
 pituitary gland tumours was decreased. no carcinogenic activity that could not be associated with the 
 pharmacological activity was identified. literature data indicate that fulvestrant treatment of mice may 
 increase serum levels of lh consistent with a hormone-mediated increase in male tumour incidence. 
 tamoxifen, another anti-oestrogen, has been shown to be hepatocarcinogenic in the rat. in contrast 
 fulvestrant did not induce liver cancers in rat, but the incidence of altered eosinophilic foci in liver was 
 increased in males.</p><p>
 reproduction toxicity studies in rat and rabbit were conducted. fulvestrant was given by 
 intramuscular injections prior to mating, through mating and implantation and through weaning. 
 fertility in female rats was reduced and embryonic survival decreased at doses 
 ≥ 0.01 mg/kg/day. following a 29-day withdrawal period fertility and embryonic survival was restored. male fertility 
 was not specifically studied, but repeated dose toxicity studies indicated loss of spermatozoa and 
 epididymides degeneration. in a rat study that included administration during organogenesis, live 
 foetuses were decreased at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. the number of foetuses with torsal flexure was 
 increased. a noel of 0.001 mg/kg/day in rat was identified for female fertility and embryonic 
 survival, foetal survival and development. rabbits treated with 1mg/kg/day had no live foetuses and at 
 0.25 mg/kg/day post-implantation loss increased. foetal development was not affected. an increased incidence of foetal variations was noted at 0.25 mg/kg/day.</p><p>
 in a rat post natal development study pup survival was lower after maternal treatment with fulvestrant. 
 pregnancy in f1 animals was not affected by maternal treatment, but pre-implantation loss was 
 increased. there were no effects on fertility, sperm counts or gonadal histopathology of f1 males. 
 9/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 separate studies showed that fulvestrant passes into milk of lactating rats. the lack of effect of potential exposure to an oestrogen receptor antagonist during neonatal life contrasts with the findings 
 from the oestrogen receptor knockout mice that are infertile and have testis degeneration. faslodex 
 should not be used during pregnancy and lactation, and this is reflected in the spc with a 
 contraindication for pregnancy and in breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical aspects</header><p>the fulvestrant clinical study programme was primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women and the pivotal study 
 data was provided by 2 phase iii studies examining the efficacy of fulvestrant for the key endpoints of 
 time to progression, objective response rate, and time to death. the programme comprises the 
 following studies:</p><p>
 • 2 phase iii pivotal efficacy studies (studies 0020 and 0021) • 2 phase ii efficacy studies (studies 0004 and o-15-22) • 18 clinical pharmacology studies (studies 0001, 0002, 0003, 0007, 0008, 0012, 0017, 0018, 0023, 0024, 0026, 0029, 0031, 0034, 0036, 
 0038, 0039 and o-15-11)</p><p>
 scientific advice was sought from the cpmp in 1997.</p></section><section><header>clinical pharmacology</header><p>pharmacokinetics eighteen clinical pharmacology studies, involving premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy female volunteers and male volunteers have been performed. pharmacokinetic data has also been collected in 
 two phase ii and two phase iii studies. specific studies in special populations have not been 
 performed. the influence of decreased renal function and demographic factors on the 
 pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 
 phase iii studies.</p><p>
 absorption 
 after administration of faslodex 250 mg intramuscularly (la formulation), fulvestrant is slowly 
 absorbed. maximum plasma concentrations are reached after about 7 days. single dose studies have 
 demonstrated that absorption continues for more than one month and that the terminal half-life is 
 about 50 days. repeated administration once a month results in an approximately 2-3 fold 
 accumulation. steady state is reached after about 6 months with the major part of the accumulation 
 achieved after 3-4 doses. at steady state there was an approximately 2-fold difference between mean 
 c
 max and cmin. unfortunately, a more frequent dosing than once a month has not been tested. with more frequent dosing during the first months, steady state (and potentially more effective 
 concentrations) could be reached earlier, possibly resulting in better efficacy. 
 absolute bioavailability has not been determined. the bioavailability has roughly been estimated to 
 about 90-100% by between study comparison. the variability in exposure after the first dose of an i.m. 
 administration of the la formulation is large. cv% was between 25 and 70% for auc
 0-28d and between 28 and 83% for c
 max suggesting a large variability in absorption rate. considerably lower variability in exposure is observed at steady state, cv% about 15%. the exposure was approximately 
 proportional to dose in the studied range 50 to 250 mg. dose proportionality above the intended dose 
 has not been studied. results from phase iii studies suggest time independent pharmacokinetics. 
 distribution 
 fulvestrant has a high volume of distribution, v
 ss is 4.1±1.6 l/kg. the plasma concentration declines in a tri-exponential fashion with rapid distribution into peripheral tissues. in vitro studies demonstrated 
 high protein binding, 99%, with lipoproteins being the major binding component. 
 10/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 elimination fulvestrant is eliminated mainly by metabolism, and to a smaller extent by biliary excretion 
 unchanged. the major route of excretion is via the faeces with less than 1% being excreted in the 
 urine.</p><p>fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, suggesting that it is a drug with high 
 extraction ratio. the metabolism of fulvestrant includes ketone and sulphone metabolites, 3-sulphate, 
 3- and 17-glucuronides. in plasma, fulvestrant was the largest component. identification of metabolites 
 in plasma was not possible due to low concentrations of radioactive material. characterisation of 
 radioactivity in faeces demonstrated at least 15 components after iv dosing, none of which amounted 
 to more than 10% of the dose and over 20 components following im administration. only 28% of the 
 extracted radioactivity (24% of the dose) was identified after im administration. although enzyme 
 hydrolysis and mass spectroscopic analysis showed that a number of the metabolites were probably 
 sulphate and/or glucuronide conjugates of unchanged [
 14c]-fulvestrant and its ketone and sulphone metabolites, the identity and potential activity of a large part of the metabolites is not known. the 
 applicant has concluded that fulvestrant is extensively metabolised, primarily by routes analogous to 
 those of endogenous oestradiol and is excreted in the faeces. none of the identified metabolites are 
 likely to contribute to a significant extent to drug activity. 
 target population 
 a population pharmacokinetic analysis on data from two phase iii studies resulted in similar or 
 somewhat lower estimate of clearance than observed in other studies. based on this analysis, the 
 estimated steady state exposure in the target population is auc 328±48 ng
 ⋅d/ml, cmax 15.8±2.4 ng/ml and c
 min 7.4±1.7 ng/ml.</p><p>special populations 
 the influence of decreased renal function and demographic factors on the pharmacokinetics of 
 fulvestrant was evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase iii studies. 
 the population included subjects with mild and moderate, but not severe renal impairment, and 
 covered an age range of 33-89 years and a weight range of 40-127 kg. the population analysis did not 
 identify any covariate influencing the clearance of fulvestrant to any significant extent.</p><p>
 interactions 
 an 
 in vitro inhibition study showed no relevant inhibition of cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6 or 3a4 by fulvestrant. other cyp450 isoenzymes were not studied and the applicant intends to evaluate the 
 influence of fulvestrant on cyp2a6, 2c8 or 2e1 as a post-authorisation commitment. the lack of 
 inhibition of cyp3a4 was confirmed in an 
 in vivo interaction study with midazolam. cyp3a4 was the only enzyme identified as having a capacity to metabolise fulvestrant 
 in vitro. interaction studies with rifampicin (cyp3a4 inducer) and ketokonazole (cyp3a4 inhibitor) demonstrated no effect on 
 fulvestrant pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 the potential for interaction with sulphate conjugation, drugs that influence hepatic blood flow and 
 protein binding displacement appears to be low.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamics the pharmacodynamic study programme was designed to demonstrate both the antioestrogenic potential of fulvestrant and also to confirm the absence of oestrogen agonist activity in 
 postmenopausal women in various oestrogen-sensitive target organs. 
 following a single dose of short-acting (study 0002) or long-acting (study 0018) fulvestrant, there 
 was evidence of dose-dependent down-regulation of oestrogen receptor (er) and effect on the er 
 pathway as evidenced by a reduced expression of pgr, and a decrease in the ki67 (an anti-
 proliferative marker) labelling index in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer. only the 
 250 mg dose showed a statistically significant reduction in er index compared to tamoxifen. 
 the effects of one dose of fulvestrant (250 mg) on tumour markers were also studied in 
 premenopausal women with er-positive primary breast cancers in study 0041. fulvestrant did not 
 exert any statistically significant anti-tumour or anti-proliferative effect as evaluated by effects on the 
 er, pgr and ki67 labeling indices.</p><p>
 11/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 short-term studies of 2 weeks’ treatment with the long-acting formulation in post-menopausal women showed that fulvestrant antagonised the effect of exogenous and endogenous oestrogen stimulation, as 
 judged by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness. fulvestrant did not have any effect on 
 endometrial thickness or fibroid volume in pre-menopausal women after 12 weeks of treatment while 
 goserelin had a statistically significant effect on both indices. 
 in postmenopausal women, fulvestrant (including long-term treatment in the phase 3 studies) did not 
 appear to have significant effects on gonadotropins, which tended to increase, but remained within 
 normal postmenopausal limits. this, and the decrease in shbg, was interpreted as indirect evidence 
 of an absence of a (significant) oestrogen agonist activity. these results, however, were not 
 conclusive, partly because of the high attrition rate of the study participants and partly because of 
 methodological issues. 
 the relationship between fulvestrant plasma concentration and effect was evaluated in studies 0018, 
 0036 and the two-phase iii studies. the pk/pd evaluations in studies 0018 and the phase iii studies 
 did not show any evidence for a relationship between fulvestrant plasma concentration and effect. 
 however, in study 0036, increased concentrations were related to a better anti-oestrogenic effect.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>valid information regarding impact of hepatic impairment on fulvestrant pharmacokinetics is lacking, and use in severe hepatic impairment has been contraindicated (see spc). use in mild and moderate 
 hepatic impairment should be approached with caution. the applicant has committed to conduct an 
 open label, phase i study to compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 18 mg short-acting 
 intramuscular dose of fulvestrant in patients with hepatic impairment to controls with normal hepatic 
 function.</p><p>
 very limited data are available on the effects of fulvestrant on endometrium thickness and no data are 
 available regarding endometrium morphology. while these short-term data cannot exclude the 
 possibility of adverse effects of long-term treatment on the endometrium and ovaries, the lack of 
 agonist activity of fulvestrant means that further evaluation of endometrial safety could be included in 
 post-marketing clinical studies. based on the 12-week study of biochemical markers of bone 
 resorbtion in pre-menopausal women, no conclusion can be drawn on the effect of long-term 
 fulvestrant on bone density in post-menopausal women. the applicant committed to further evaluate 
 endometrial and bone safety. 
 a clear deficiency of the clinical development program is the lack of dose finding studies. while the 
 results of an uncontrolled study 0004 were presented as the basis for selecting the 250 mg dose for the 
 pivotal studies, efficacy data were collected at the 250 mg dose without any comparative efficacy data 
 at the lower doses. a dose higher than 250 mg monthly was not studied. as stated by the applicant, 
 there were formulation issues that restricted concentrations greater than 50 mg/ml, and practical 
 standards in-patient care that limit intramuscular injection volume. the question is whether a shorter 
 dosing interval or a regime involving two injections to deliver a higher dose could have been 
 investigated. results from study 0036 on post-menopausal endometrium discussed above and the two 
 pivotal studies were consistent in showing that 250 mg fulvestrant had a larger effect size than the 125 
 mg dose, and the possibility of an even larger effect size with a higher dose can not be excluded. 
 furthermore, study of dynamic markers in study 0018 did not conclusively show that the effect of 250 
 mg fulvestrant was larger than tamoxifen, and as will be discussed later.moreover, the population 
 pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and 
 response using estimated pharmacokinetic parameters after the first dose and at steady state. the 
 absorption rate is highly variable and time to reach steady state is up to 6 months. many patients 
 progress in their disease before steady state has been reached. from the evaluations provided (first 
 dose and steady state only), no conclusions can be drawn regarding actual concentration prior to and at 
 time of progression. nor can conclusions be drawn regarding if there is a difference in plasma 
 concentration between patients progressing in their disease and patients responding to therapy at 
 different time points on the way to steady state. if the high initial variability in exposure and long time 
 until steady state is reached are potential reasons for treatment failure, a better response could be 
 obtained by a more optimal posology, e.g. with more frequent dosing during the first months. the 
 applicant has committed to conduct a phase iii study comparing the 250 mg monthly dose with a 500 
 12/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 mg monthly dose in combination with a loading dose in the second line treatment setting. using simulation models, the proposed dosage in the new study seems appropriate.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>main clinical studies</p><p>the efficacy of fulvestrant was investigated in two randomised multicentre controlled clinical trials, studies 0020 and 0021, in comparison to the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in 
 postmenopausal women with locally invasive advanced or metastatic breast cancer (table 1). study 
 0020 was an open trial conducted in europe while study 0021 was a double-blind trial conducted in 
 north america. the 250 mg dose was administered as a single intramuscular injection in the european 
 study while two serial injections, one per buttock, were administered in the north american study, in 
 accordance with the north american nursing guidelines on intramuscular injections. the studies were 
 otherwise similar in design and a combined analysis was prospectively defined. these two studies 
 were initially designed to study both 125 mg and 250 mg monthly dose groups.</p><p>study of the 125 mg 
 group was terminated early because of insufficient evidence of activity in the first 30 patients enrolled 
 across the two trials as prospectively defined. these patients were either withdrawn from the trial or 
 were permitted to continue on the 125 mg dose, but not to increase to the 250 mg dose. both studies 
 were originally designed to investigate the potential superiority of fulvestrant over anastrozole but the 
 results did not reach statistical significance. a switch to a claim of non-inferiority was made and 
 analysis performed using a non-inferiority margin that was assigned retrospectively by an independent 
 expert group.</p></section><section><header>table 1 summary of efficacy studies</header><p>study id</p><p>design

 emea 2005 methods study participants and eligibility criteria. eligible patients were postmenopausal women with hormone 
 sensitive locally invasive advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had progressed following 
 hormonal therapy for advanced disease or had relapsed after adjuvant endocrine therapy with a non-
 steroidal anti-oestrogen. breast cancer had to be confirmed histologically or cytologically. each 
 patient had to have at least 1 measurable or evaluable lesion in order to be eligible for inclusion.</p><p>
 evidence of hormone sensitivity was defined as (a) at least 12 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy 
 before relapse, (b) tumour remission or stabilisation after at least 3 months of hormonal therapy before 
 progression, or (c) a tumour status of oestrogen-receptor positive (er+) or progesterone-receptor 
 positive (pgr+).</p><p>patients with a tumour status of er negative or er unknown were permitted to enter 
 the studies as long as they fulfilled either criteria (a) or (b).</p><p>
 in addition, selection criteria included a world health organisation (who) performance status of 0 
 (fully active), 1 (ambulatory, able to do light work or pursue a sedentary occupation), or 2 
 (ambulatory, capable of self-care but unable to work) (ref: who 1979) and a life expectancy of 
 greater than 3 months. patients were to be excluded from study participation if they had serious 
 concurrent medical illnesses or laboratory abnormalities that would compromise safety or interfere 
 with the collection or interpretation of efficacy and safety data. patients were also to be excluded in 
 case of</p><p>previous treatment with the following: fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitors; two or more 
 regimens of endocrine therapy for advanced disease (excluding oophorectomy, ovarian radiation, or 
 luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [lh-rh] analogue therapy), radiation or chemotherapy within 
 4 to 6 weeks of baseline tumour assessment; or oestrogen replacement therapy (within 4 weeks of 
 randomisation [study 0021], ongoing at entry [study 0020]); or investigational drug therapy within 4 
 weeks of randomisation.</p><p>treatments. in both studies, patients received monthly intramuscular long-acting fulvestrant at 250 mg 
 or 125 mg, or the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole at 1 mg orally per day. patients also 
 received, in addition to active treatment, either placebo tablets or placebo injections to maintain 
 blinding to treatment in study 0021. study 0020 was an open study while study 0021 was double-
 blind.</p><p>
 frequency of clinical assessments. patients were assessed at baseline and monthly for 3 months and 3-
 monthly thereafter for 12 months or until withdrawal or progression of disease or death.</p><p>
 objectives and endpoints. the primary objective was to compare time to disease progression. the 
 secondary objectives were to compare the objective response rate, duration of response, time to 
 treatment failure, time to death, symptomatic response, quality of life, tolerability (local and systemic) 
 and pharmacokinetic assessment.</p><p>
 time to disease progression was defined as the number of days from date of randomisation until date 
 of objective disease progression (as first documented), or until death from any cause, whichever 
 occurred first. the date of progression was determined using the earliest of dates where there was an 
 increase in size of more than 25% for a measurable lesion, progression of an evaluable non-
 measurable lesion or a new lesion as indicated by the investigator. for patients who had not 
 progressed at the time of data cut-off, data were right censored for analysis purposes to last assessment 
 date. objective tumour assessments were first completed in the 4 weeks that preceded the first 
 administration of study treatment.</p><p>post-treatment assessments were then repeated every 3 months (
 ±2 weeks) until disease progression.</p><p>patients with physically assessable soft-tissue lesions were also 
 assessed monthly for the first 3 months of treatment.</p><p>the treatment was continued until objective 
 evidence of disease progression or other events requiring treatment withdrawal. patients were 
 followed up for survival until death. the disease was designated as measurable; evaluable but not 
 measurable; or neither measurable nor evaluable. patients taking bisphosphonate treatment could enter 
 the trial and their bone lesions could be evaluated for disease progression but not for tumour response. 
 the radiological data were read locally. 
 measurable disease was defined as lesions that were clinically measurable in 2 perpendicular axes 
 with at least 1 dimension being greater than or equal to 2.5 cm or measurable using imaging in 
 2 perpendicular axes with both dimensions being greater than or equal to 1.0 cm.</p><p>up to 4 measurable lesions [largest and most clearly defined] were assessed per patient and monitored throughout the 
 14/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 study. assessment of tumour response was made for both measurable and non-measurable disease based on response categories defined according to the union internationale contre le cancer (uicc) 
 criteria for complete response, partial response, stable disease or disease progression. 
 time to treatment failure was defined as the time between randomisation and the earliest occurrence 
 of disease progression, withdrawal of study treatment for any reason, or death from any cause. patients 
 who have not failed treatment at data cut off would be right-censored at the most recent date of 
 assessment. time to death was defined the number of days from randomisation to death. this was 
 analysed in the same way as the time to progression. patients who were alive at data cut off will be 
 right-censored at the latest date they were known to be alive. duration of response was calculated for 
 those who had a best response of complete response or partial response. symptomatic response 
 comprising analgesic use, global pain score and performance status was summarised without statistical 
 analysis. 
 qol was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast (fact-b), consisting 
 of the fact-g ‘general’ qol tool for cancer patients and the breast cancer sub-scale (bcs) 
 questionnaires.</p><p>
 sample size. the estimation of sample size was based on the primary end point of time to progression.</p><p>
 assuming a median time to progression for anastrozole of 140 days (ref: buzdar 1996), 490 events 
 were considered necessary to detect a hazard ratio of greater than or equal to 1.43 or less than or equal 
 to 0.70, at a significance level of 5% with 90% power. given that both studies had an estimated 
 accrual time of 24 months, with 6-month follow-up periods, patient requirements were 196 patients 
 per treatment group per study or at least 588 patients per study.</p><p>when the 125-mg treatment group 
 was dropped, 196 patients would be required in each of the remaining 2 groups, and the analysis 
 would be performed when at least 340 end point events had occurred across each of the remaining 
 2 groups. patients were randomised 1:1:1 into faslodex 125 mg, faslodex 250 mg or anastrozole 1 
 mg. 
 statistical analyses 
 the primary analysis was a 
 cox proportional-hazards model with baseline covariates (age, performance status, measurable compared with non-measurable disease, receptor status, previous 
 response to hormone therapy, previous use of cytotoxics and use of bisphosphonates for bone disease), 
 based on the itt population (on the basis of randomised treatment for all randomised patients, 
 regardless of treatment actually received). secondary analyses were conducted for a subset of patients 
 who did not significantly violate or deviate from the protocol (also known as the per-protocol 
 population), by treatment received, and for the itt population with data unadjusted for baseline 
 effects.</p><p>secondary analyses were used to assess whether the conclusions from the primary analyses 
 were robust.</p><p>
 time to progression (ttp) was summarised by trial treatment using the kaplan-meier method. the 
 treatment comparisons was performed using the cox proportional-hazards model, adjusting for 
 baseline prognostic covariates:. the log-rank test was used to provide a comparison of treatment 
 groups without adjusting for potential prognostic factors. a global test for treatment-by-baseline 
 covariate interactions was performed.</p><p>
 objective responders were patients with a best objective response of complete response or partial 
 response. a logistic regression model was used for analysis of objective response rate and covariates 
 were included in the model. objective response rates would also be assessed for a subgroup of patients 
 excluding patients with bone only disease treated with biphosphonates. 
 the effects of centre and treatment-by-centre interaction were not investigated.</p><p>additionally, no 
 analyses were performed for individual centres or for any centre sub-grouping. except where noted, 
 all significance levels were 2-sided. 
 as prospectively planned, data from studies 0020 and 0021 were combined for an overall evaluation 
 of fulvestrant effects at the 250-mg dose</p><p>
 15/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 results</p><p>a total of 1014 patients from 83 centres in north america and 83 centres in europe, australia,and 
 south africa were randomised to treatment in studies 0020 and 0021 (figure 1 and 2). of these,428 
 patients were randomised to monthly treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg (study 0021, 206 patients; 
 study 0020, 222 patients), 423 to daily treatment with anastrozole 1 mg (study 0021, 194 patients;

 dose after treating 30 patients (across studies 0020 and 0021) for a minimum of 3 months because 
 there was no previous response data at this dose. the second interim analysis was performed after 170 
 end point events in each of the studies were recorded across the remaining 2 treatment groups. 
 data review of the fulvestrant 125 mg dose group 
 the objective was to assess whether 125 mg fulvestrant would produce a response in 10% of the target 
 population. had the dose produced a 10% or greater response rate, a 95% chance that 1 or more 
 objective tumour responses would be obtained in 29 successive patients was estimated. at the time of 
 the review, 1 (3.3%) patient had withdrawn, 9 (30%) had stable disease, and 20 (66.7%) had disease 
 progression. randomisation to the 125-mg dose group was dropped from both studies on 29 april 
 1998 because no tumour responses were observed. these patients were switched from fulvestrant 125 
 mg to the most appropriate subsequent therapy as determined by the individual investigator and 
 patient, and no further efficacy data were collected.</p><p>
 although no tumour responses were observed among the first 30 patients randomised to fulvestrant 
 125 mg followed-up for a minimum of 3 months, further examination of tumour response data up to 
 29 april 1998 indicates tumour shrinkage of 50% or greater; i.e. tumour response, in 4/161 (2.5%) of 
 patients in this treatment group. 
 final analyses and switch from superiority to non-inferiority 
 superiority was not demonstrated and treatment with fulvestrant was retrospectively assessed for non-
 inferiority, compared with anastrozole, for the pre-defined efficacy end points of time to progression, 
 objective response, and time to treatment failure. the applicant convened a group of independent 
 clinical and statistical experts in breast cancer to discuss the design of a potential clinical study 
 programme to demonstrate non-inferiority of a new hormonal agent for post-menopausal women with 
 advanced breast cancer, when compared with standard therapy. these participants were selected also 
 on the basis of lack of previous connection with the clinical development of fulvestrant, and, at the 
 time of the forum, no knowledge of the results from the fulvestrant phase iii clinical programme. 
 the participants reached a consensus that “it would be reasonable to use anastrozole as the reference 
 arm”. anastrozole was the first, and remains the most widely prescribed, third generation non-
 steroidal aromatase inhibitor, and was selected as the active comparator in both studies.</p><p>based on the 
 25/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 historical performance of anastrozole, when previously compared with megestrol acetate in two published studies using similar patient population as the fulvestrant program, this corresponded to a 
 median ttp of approximately 5 months.</p><p> 
 in the absence of data for placebo, the group speculated that the median ttp for ‘no treatment’ would 
 be approximately 3 months. the group then indicated that at least one half of the presumed benefit for 
 the new agent should preserve anastrozole over ‘no treatment’. the 2-sided 95% confidence interval 
 for the ttp hazard ratio should allow a median ttp of less than 4 months for the new agent to be 
 ruled out. this corresponds to a maximally acceptable hazard ratio of 5/4 = 1.25 for the new agent in 
 relation to anastrozole. continuing this line of reasoning, a hazard ratio of 3/5 = 0.60 for anastrozole in 
 relation to ‘no treatment’ would apply. the applicant also justified the choice of non-inferiority 
 margin by citing that a similar margin of 0.25 was used in the assessment of toremifene for approval 
 as a regulatory precedent. the applicant used 
 post-hoc comparisons of time to progression using fulvestrant 250 mg or anastrozole with fulvestrant 125 mg to support the speculated effect of no 
 treatment proposed by the independent expert group (table 14).</p></section><section><header>table 14  results for time to progression comparisons with fulvestrant 125 mg (studies 20

 it can be concluded that non-inferiority of fulvestrant 250 mg is demonstrated even for the most 
 conservative estimation for the following reason. using the upper confidence limit of anastrozole over 
 “no treatment” of 0.84, the non-inferiority margin for 50% of the least benefit of anastrozole over “no 
 treatment” is set as 0.92. as the lower confidence limit of anastrozole over fulvestrant 250 is 0.91 
 (1/1.10), this lies just to the right of the non-inferiority margin as shown in figure 6.</p><p>

 emea 2005 clinical benefit: patients designated as responders (complete response or partial response) plus those with a best response of stable disease for 24 or more weeks (calculated from the date of 
 randomisation) were considered to have achieved clinical benefit.</p><p>combined data showed that a 
 similar proportion of fulvestrant-treated patients [186 (43.5%)] achieved clinical benefit compared 
 with anastrozole-treated patients [173 (40.9%)]. median duration of clinical benefit (time between 
 randomisation and first observation of progression) was 20 days longer for patients in the fulvestrant 
 group (combined data) compared with that for patients in the anastrozole group. 
 time to treatment failure: the estimated median time to treatment failure (combined data) was 31 
 days longer for patients in the fulvestrant group (141 days) compared with patients in the anastrozole 
 group (110 days); however, time to treatment failure was not statistically significantly different 
 between</p><p>treatment groups (p=0.6149). 
 quality of life: qol was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast 
 questionnaires. qol was maintained for patients who received treatment.</p><p>time to deterioration in 
 qol (combined data) was not statistically significantly different between treatment groups 
 (p=0.6051).</p><p>the median times to deterioration in qol were 186 and 191 days for patients in the 
 fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, respectively.</p><p>the pattern of deterioration appeared to follow that 
 for progression, suggesting that deterioration in qol was a function of disease progression rather than 
 treatment.</p><p>the similarity in qol measures between studies 0020 and 0021 shows that the use of an 
 injection versus an oral treatment does not lead to an adverse effect on qol.</p><p>
 supportive studies 
 there were three supportive non-comparative efficacy studies, namely 0004, sz001 and o-15-22, 
 involving small number of patients.</p><p>
 study 0004 was a dose-exploring, non-comparative phase ii efficacy study. in study 0004, three doses 
 of fulvestrant-50, 100, and 250 mg-were evaluated in a dose-escalating fashion. among patients who 
 received the 250-mg dose (n =19), 7 had partial responses and 6 had stable disease for at least 6 
 months. 
 study o-15-22 was an open, non-comparative, japanese phase ii bridging study involving 30 
 postmenopausal japanese women with advanced breast cancer, who had relapsed on tamoxifen (or 
 toremifene) therapy after initial response to the therapy.</p><p>for the primary endpoint of objective tumour 
 response, the response rate was 23.3%, with supportive data provided by the secondary endpoints of 
 clinical benefit, time to progression, duration of response, and time to response.</p><p> 
 study sz0001 (currently ongoing), is an open, multicentre, non-comparative european phase ii 
 investigator initiated study, with 46 subjects recruited to date in postmenopausal women with 
 advanced breast cancer who had failed on prior therapy with non-steroidal or steroidal aromatase 
 inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole or aminoglutethimide).</p><p>preliminary analyses of data from 32 eligible 
 patients, indicated the following responses: partial response 6%, stable disease 28%, progressive 
 disease 66%, and clinical benefit 34%. 
 other studies 
 study 0025 compared 250 mg fulvestrant with tamoxifen as 
 first line treatment in post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer. a total of 587 patients were randomised in this double-blind 
 study. the results showed that fulvestrant had anti-tumour effect but neither superiority nor non-
 inferiority of fulvestrant 250 mg relative to tamoxifen could be concluded for the primary endpoint 
 time to progression. the hazard ratio for time to progression was 1.18 (95% ci 0.98 to 1.44). 
 statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoints, time to treatment failure and clinical 
 benefit, favoured tamoxifen. the criterion for non-inferiority of fulvestrant relative to tamoxifen was 
 met for objective response rate. the hazard ratio for objective response rate was 0.87 (95% ci 0.61 to 
 1.14). the study was not sufficiently mature to assess survival at the time of data cut-off. 
 study 0042 was a study that compared fulvestrant with tamoxifen as neoadjuvant treatment in post 
 menopausal women with primary breast cancer. this study was terminated early after enrolling three 
 patients on ethical grounds because results from the 0025 study showed that equivalence to tamoxifen 
 could not be claimed.</p><p>28/33</p><p>
 emea 2005</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>the efficacy of fulvestrant was investigated in two randomised multicentre controlled clinical trials, studies 0020 and 0021, in comparison to the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in 
 postmenopausal women with locally invasive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. all patients were 
 accounted for and followed up in the two pivotal studies. combined analysis of the two trials showed 
 that both treatment groups were comparable with respect to baseline data. 355 (82.9%) of 428 patients 
 in the fulvestrant group and 358 (84.6%) of 423 patients in the anastrozole group, had disease 
 progression. tumour progression during treatment was the most common progression event, 
 accounting for progression in 77.6% of the fulvestrant group and 79% of the anastrozole group. death 
 as a progression event occurred in less than 5% in each group. the per protocol analyses confirmed 
 that the most conservative estimate of time to progression for patients treated with fulvestrant 250 mg 
 was unlikely to be more than 11% higher than that for patients treated with anastrozole. the difference 
 in median time to progression in the two arms in the two studies was noted but the hazard ratios were 
 similar and the kaplan-meier plots for the two arms were similar and the point differences observed at 
 the medians were not sustained. 
 both studies were originally designed to investigate the potential superiority of fulvestrant over 
 anastrozole but the results did not reach statistical significance. a switch to a claim of non-inferiority 
 was made and analysis performed using a non-inferiority margin that was assigned retrospectively. 
 the non-inferiority criterion 0.25 as proposed by the applicant is acceptable based on an independent 
 definition of delta using published data and the approval of toremifene using a delta of 0.25 as 
 regulatory precedent. the choice of 0.25 as the margin is also consistent with the emea concept 
 paper (cpmp/ewp/2158/99) on the choice of delta. the true effect of placebo in this setting is 
 unknown but the sponsor was able to use post-hoc analysis of the effect of fulvestrant 125 mg to 
 justify the speculated placebo effect, even though fulvestrant 125 mg was unlikely to be worse than no 
 treatment. because of an absence of dose-finding studies, these two studies were initially designed to 
 study both 125 mg and 250 mg monthly dose groups.</p><p>study of the 125 mg group was terminated early 
 because of the lack of objective response in the first 30 patients enrolled across the two trials after 
 prospectively defined interim data analysis. 
 it can be concluded that non-inferiority of fulvestrant 250 mg is demonstrated even for the most 
 conservative estimation for the following reason. using the upper confidence limit of anastrozole over 
 “no treatment” of 0.84, the non-inferiority margin for 50% of the least benefit of anastrozole over “no 
 treatment” is set as 0.92. as the lower confidence limit of anastrozole over fulvestrant 250 is 0.91 
 (1/1.10), this lies just to the right of the non-inferiority margin. 
 combining both studies, the estimated itt median time to death was similar for patients in the 
 fulvestrant group compared with patients in the anastrozole group (833 vs. 839 days). the per protocol 
 analyses were consistent with the primary itt analysis and the death rate for fulvestrant was unlikely 
 to be more than 19% higher than that of the anastrozole treatment group. the hazard ratios for the 
 individual studies and the combined analysis were approximately 1 and the kaplan-meier curves were 
 similar. as the two studies were not designed to show superiority with respect to survival, there was 
 limited power to detect treatment difference in time to death. 
 overall, 20 (4.7%) patients in the fulvestrant group compared with 11 (2.6%) in the anastrozole group 
 achieved a complete response (cr), and 62 (14.5%) in the fulvestrant group compared with 59 
 (13.9%) in the anastrozole group achieved a partial response (pr). these differences between 
 treatments for objective response were not statistically significant. a trend in favour of fulvestrant was 
 obtained in the open study but not in the double-blind study.</p><p>the odds ratios were 1 or larger in the 
 individual and combined studies, in favour of fulvestrant although none of these results reached 
 statistical significance. the per protocol analysis of the combined results was consistent with the itt 
 analysis and the objective response rate obtained from fulvestrant was unlikely to be 2.3% below that 
 of anastrozole. 
 for both treatments, numerical comparisons between subgroups suggested a greater objective response 
 among patients with history of previous hormonal treatment, patients without visceral disease, and 
 patients with measurable disease only, although the latter should be considered cautiously given the 
 small number of patients. median duration of response from the date of randomisation and from date 
 of objective response were consistently longer among patients in the fulvestrant groups compared with

 a categories are not mutually exclusive. n = subset of subjects. n = total number of subjects exposed.</p><p>there were a total of 39 adverse events that resulted in death in the entire clinical development program. five deaths occurred in the fulvestrant arm compared to 8 in the anastrozole arm in the 
 pivotal trials. all causes, in descending frequency, included heart failure, myocardial infarct, 
 arrhythmia, pulmonary embolus, infections, cerebrovascular disease, and isolated cases of renal 
 failure, hypercalcemia, haemorrhage and radiation injury.</p><p>
 serious adverse events regardless of association with treatment were reported in 82 (19.4%) of the 
 fulvestrant group compared with 68 (16%) of the anastrozole group. apart from nausea, vomiting, 
 dehydration, pneumonia or pathological fractures that occurred in more than 5 patients in either one of 
 the two treatment groups, a difference in the profile between fulvestrant and anastrozole can not be 
 concluded. however, although drug-related pulmonary embolism was equally uncommon (0.5%) in 
 both groups, deep thrombophlebitis/pulmonary embolus was reported as sae in a slightly higher 
 number of patients in the fulvestrant group: pulmonary embolism fulvestrant n=5 (1.2%) versus 
 anastrozole n=2 (0.5%); deep venous thrombosis fulvestrant n=5 (1.2%) versus anastrozole n=3 
 (0.7%). as many of these patients had predisposing factors, a treatment-related effect can not be 
 concluded nor excluded.</p><p>
 the commonest adverse events affecting both fulvestrant and anastrozole treatment groups were 
 nausea, asthenia, pain vasodilatation, and headache. these were consistent with the effects of 
 oestrogen deprivation. in general, there were small differences in incidences between the two groups 
 except for a 50% higher incidence of joint disorders in the anastrozole group. joint disorders are 
 known to be associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors.</p><p>

 events in study 0021 was higher comopared to study 0020.</p><p>it is presumed to be due to the greater number of injections (2 
 per visit for all patients) in study 0021.</p><p> 31/33</p><p>
 emea 2005 fulvestrant injections were reasonably well tolerated. 11% of the fulvestrant group reported pain at the injection site but these cases were typically mild to moderate in intensity. there was one patient who 
 withdrew because of pain. so far, only one case of local necrosis requiring debridement has been 
 reported in a diabetic patient for whom there was some doubt on whether the injection was 
 administered correctly into the muscle.</p><p>
 immunogenicity events had not been specifically studied. two cases of angioedema had been 
 reported, one in the clinical trial program and another post-marketing. a total of 5 cases of urticaria 
 have been reported in the post-marketing program.</p><p>
 the shift tables on haematology, biochemistry and liver enzymes from baseline to withdrawal showed 
 similar trends for changes in both treatment groups. a few cases of leucopenia were reported in 
 patients who received cytotoxics treatment soon after withdrawal from treatment and that would have 
 been the more likely cause. analyses of ast, alt in those patients with or without liver metastases 
 did not point to any significant hepatotoxic risk for fulvestrant. the currently available data do not 
 suggest any significant diabetogenic potential for fulvestrant. 
 the switch from tamoxifen was followed by changes in total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol and 
 lipoprotein a increased in both the fulvestrant group and anastrozole group and that was not 
 unexpected.</p><p>
 there were no drug interactions of note reported in the clinical trial program.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the total number of patients exposed to fulvestrant in the clinical trial programme is sufficient for preliminary assessment of safety in view of the proposed therapeutic indication. however, due to the 
 patient population with advanced breast cancer, the median duration of exposure is not high 
 (approximately 6 months). many potential risks of treatment (such as cardiovascular undesirable 
 effects, including venous thromboembolism, adverse effect on bone density, effects on ovaries and 
 endometrium) may not be readily assessable based on the database. 
 the number of deaths due to adverse events was too low to allow comment on difference between 
 groups but patients who died in the fulvestrant group were younger than those in the anastrozole 
 group. the cause of death was reported heart arrest, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia and 
 pulmonary embolism in the four cases of cardiovascular death in the fulvestrant group.</p><p>
 concerning the observed serious adverse events, both arterial and venous thromboembolic events 
 should be kept under observation in the post-marketing program. the applicant has committed to 
 provide cumulative review of these adverse events, within the post-marketing surveillance program. 
 cumulative review will also be provided for cardiovascular events (arrhythmia, heart failure, 
 ischaemic heart disease), hypersensitivity, fractures and osteoporosis, and local reactions.</p><p>
 the applicant proposed to assess the effect of fulvestrant on the endometrium in the neoadjuvant 
 setting and this is supported. in view of the mechanism of action of fulvestrant, the study duration of 4 
 months is acceptable.</p><p>
 a negative effect on bone mineral density with long-term fulvestrant treatment is considered to be 
 likely because of its antioestrogenic effect. the recently published randomised trial of letrozole in 
 postmenopausal women after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy for early-stage breast cancer reported a 
 numerically increarse in the rate of new-onset osteoporosis in the letrozole group (5.8%) in 
 comparison with placebo (4.5%, p=0.07) (goss et al., 2003). the applicant committed to study 
 biochemical markers of bone turnover in the neoadjuvant setting. it is agreed that it would be difficult 
 to interpret changes in bone mineral density in the metastatic disease setting.</p><p>a warning has been 
 included in the spc that .</p><p>due to the mode of actions of fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of 
 osteoporosis.</p><p>

 emea 2005</p></section><section><header n="5">5. overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
  quality</header><p>the quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the spc. physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
 performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. there are 
 no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the benefit risk balance of the product.</p></section><section><header>non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>fulvestrant is a non-agonist antioestrogen and has no other discernible pharmacological effects. the mode of action appears related to estrogen receptor downregulation. the non-clinical data presented is 
 consistent with the compound having efficacy in the proposed indication of treatment of advanced 
 breast cancer in women whose disease has progressed following endocrine therapy.</p><p>
 fulvestrant has low acute and chronic toxic potential. the pivotal toxicology studies have been 
 conducted in appropriate species and have shown that there are no major issues of concern from a pre-
 clinical perspective.</p><p>overall, adverse findings can be considered to be linked to the pharmacological 
 mode of action. in the present set of non-clinical studies no toxicological findings can be identified 
 that may be considered real safety issues.</p></section><section><header>clinical documentation  
 pharmacology</header><p>the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been studied appropriately. two follow-up measures are related to influence of hepatic impairment on fulvestrant pharmacokinetics and potential for inhibition 
 of cyp2a6, cyp2c8 and cyp2e1.</p><p>
 the optimal dose and regimen of fulvestrant in terms of benefit/risk is still not clarified but the 
 applicant has committed to resolve this through a post-marketing study.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>the overall conclusion on efficacy is that fulvestrant 250mg monthly treatment is non-inferior to anastrozole 1mg daily treatment in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast 
 cancer whose disease has progressed following hormonal therapy or had relapsed after adjuvant 
 endocrine therapy with an anti-oestrogen. this second-line indication is restricted to those patients 
 with er positive breast cancer, consistent with the mechanism of action of fulvestrant and the analysis 
 of results according to er status.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>the available safety data suggest that fulvestrant la im 250 mg once a month has an acceptable safety profile in the context of the proposed therapeutic indications. data on endometrial and bone safety are 
 limited, and further evaluation is required as post-marketing studies. the absence of safety data in 
 patients with hepatic impairment, especially in view of expected major impact of hepatic impairment 
 on fulvestrant pharmacokinetics, requires further investigations. hypersensitivity reactions 
 (angioedema and urticaria), cardiovascular reactions (including arterial and venous thromboembolism, 
 arrhythmia and heart failure), cerebrovascular events and hepatic adverse drug reactions must continue 
 to be closely monitored with reporting of cumulative incidences. adverse effect on bone density and 
 fractures with long-term use is not unexpected and monitoring of these events should also be 
 undertaken. the applicant has committed to a post-marketing surveillance programme to monitor 
 these events.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>fulvestrant 250mg monthly treatment is non-inferior to anastrozole 1mg daily treatment in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has

 emea 2005 progressed following hormonal therapy or had relapsed after adjuvant endocrine therapy with an anti-oestrogen. this second-line indication is restricted to those patients with er positive breast cancer, 
 consistent with the mechanism of action of fulvestrant and the analysis of results according to er 
 status.</p><p>
 the optimal dose and regimen of fulvestrant in terms of benefit/risk is still not clarified. in response to 
 the cpmp’s list of outstanding issues, the applicant has proposed a new study (0064) to compare the 
 250mg monthly dose with a 500mg monthly dose in combination with a loading dose in the second-
 line treatment setting. the applicant has also submitted an outline to a neoadjuvant study (0065) and 
 it is agreed that this study will provide useful and relevant information on the relationship between 
 exposure, er receptor down-regulation and efficacy. the results of both of these studies will be 
 submitted as post-marketing commitments.</p><p>
 the dose comparison study was discussed within the cpmp therapeutic advisory group in oncology. 
 the advisory group considered that proposed new study to compare the 250 mg monthly dose with a 
 higher dose in combination with a loading dose in a second-line indication is considered useful. the 
 study should be adequately powered to detect a risk reduction, which is considered clinically 
 meaningful.</p><p>
 while the available safety profile of the 250mg monthly dose is acceptable in the context of the 
 proposed therapeutic indication, data on endometrial and bone safety are limited, further evaluation 
 has therefore been included in the proposed post-marketing clinical studies. the applicant’s proposal 
 to commit to further investigate endometrial safety and bone safety as part of a neoadjuvant study is 
 acceptable. due to limited experience, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular reactions (including 
 arterial and venous thromboembolism, arrhythmia and heart failure), cerebrovascular events, and 
 hepatic adrs will be closely monitored in a post-marketing surveillance program.</p><p>
 based on the cpmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the cpmp considered by consensus 
 that the benefit/risk profile of faslodex in the treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen 
 receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for disease relapse on or after adjuvant 
 antioestrogen therapy or disease progression on therapy with an antioestrogen was favourable.</p></section></body></xml>
