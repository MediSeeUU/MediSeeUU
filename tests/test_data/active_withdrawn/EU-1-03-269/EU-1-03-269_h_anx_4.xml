 paediatric patients faslodex is not recommended for use in children or adolescents, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this age group.</p><p>renal impairment no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 ≥ 30 ml/min). safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these 
 patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>hepatic impairment no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>
 method of administration 
 faslodex should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular injection 
 (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each</p><p>buttock.</p><p>
 for detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the other excipients.</p><p>3 pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6) severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>faslodex should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).</p><p>
 faslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 less than 30 ml/min).</p><p>
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, faslodex should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.</p><p>
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical trials with faslodex (see section 4.8). this should be taken into consideration 
 when prescribing faslodex to patients at risk.</p><p>
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. due to the mechanism of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of cyp3a4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp3a4. clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp3a4) and 
 ketoconazole (inhibitor of cyp3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. 
 dose</p><p>adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and cyp3a4 
 inhibitors or inducers concomitantly.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>faslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). fulvestrant has been shown to cross the placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. studies in animals have shown reproductive 
 toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). patients 
 of child-bearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception while on treatment. if 
 pregnancy occurs while taking faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.</p><p>
 breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with faslodex. fulvestrant is excreted in milk in 
 lactating rats. it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. considering the potential 
 for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is 
 contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>faslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. however, since asthenia has been reported very commonly with faslodex, caution should be observed by those 
 patients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>this section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-marketing studies or spontaneous reports. the most frequently reported adverse reactions are injection site 
 reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic enzymes.</p><p>

 mechanism of action 
 fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
 fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
 the mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels.</p><p> 
 clinical trials in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
 significantly down-regulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was 
 also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic 
 estrogen agonist effects.</p><p>
 clinical safety and efficacy in advanced breast cancer 
 a phase iii clinical trial was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer 
 who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine 
 therapy for advanced disease. this trial compared the efficacy and safety of faslodex 500 mg (n=362) 
 with faslodex 250 mg (n=374). time to progression was the primary endpoint, key secondary efficacy 
 endpoints included objective response rate (orr), clinical benefit rate (cbr) and overall survival 
 (os). efficacy results for the confirm study are summarized in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2 summary of results of the primary efficacy endpoint (ttp) and key

 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. 77% of the study population had estrogen receptor 
 positive breast cancer. these trials compared the safety and efficacy of monthly administration of 
 faslodex 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). overall, 
 faslodex at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of time to 
 progression, objective response, and time to death. there were no statistically significant differences 
 in any of these endpoints between the two treatment groups. time to progression was the primary</p><p>6endpoint. combined analysis of both trials showed that 83% of patients who received fulvestrant progressed, compared with 85% of patients who received anastrozole. combined analysis of both 
 trials showed the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg to anastrozole for time to progression was 
 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10). the objective response rate for faslodex 250 mg was 19.2% compared 
 with 16.5% for anastrozole. the median time to death was 27.4 months for patients treated with 
 fulvestrant and 27.6 months for patients treated with anastrozole. the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg 
 to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci 0.86 to 1.19).</p><p>
 effects on the postmenopausal endometrium preclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium (see section 5.3). a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day 
 ethinylestradiol showed that pre-treatment with faslodex 250 mg resulted in significantly reduced 
 stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged 
 by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness</p><p>
 there are no data on the long-term effects of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium. no data 
 are available regarding endometrial morphology.</p><p>
 in two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) with premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
 disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measuring 
 between fulvestrant and placebo groups.</p><p>
 effects on bone there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption</p><p>after administration of faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed 
 and maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) are reached after about 5 days. administration of faslodex 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month 
 of dosing (mean [cv]: auc 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, c
 max 25.1 [35.1%] ng/ml, cmin 16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained within a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and 
 trough concentrations. after intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately 
 dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg.</p><p>
 distribution 
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. the large apparent volume of distribution at 
 steady state (vd
 ss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. very low density lipoprotein (vldl), low 
 density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are the major binding 
 components. no interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. the role of sex 
 hormone-binding globulin (shbg) has not been determined.</p><p>
 metabolism</p><p>the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of 
 possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. identified metabolites 
 (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or 
 exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-estrogen models. studies using human liver preparations 
 and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme involved in the 
 oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo. in vitro data suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes.</p><p>
 elimination</p><p> 7fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. the major route of excretion is via the faeces, with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) after intramuscular administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase iii studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s 
 pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.</p><p>
 renal impairment mild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical trial conducted in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b). a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold increase 
 in auc in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. in patients administered 
 faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated.</p><p>subjects with 
 severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) were not evaluated.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.</p><p> 
 faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies. local reactions, including myositis and granulomatoma at the injection site were 
 attributed to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to 
 the saline control. in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, 
 the anti-estrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in 
 the female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes.</p><p>
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen. these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt; 40 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.</p><p>
 fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential. 
 fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
 anti-estrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats, a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed. rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in 
 placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence 
 of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral 
 vertebrae).</p><p>
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males. induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations. these findings are not of clinical 
 relevance for the use of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p> 8 ethanol (96 per cent) benzyl alcohol</p><p>
