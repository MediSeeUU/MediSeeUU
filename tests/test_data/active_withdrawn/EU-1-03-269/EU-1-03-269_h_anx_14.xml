 4.1
 therapeutic indications</header><p>faslodex is indicated:as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
 -
 not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or
 -
 with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on 
 antiestrogen therapy.
 in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
 cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1).
 in pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined 
 with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) agonist.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>posologyadult females (including elderly)the recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given two weeks after the initial dose.
 when faslodex is used in combination with palbociclib, please also refer to the summary of product
 characteristics of palbociclib.
 prior to the start of treatment with the combination of faslodex plus palbociclib, and throughout its 
 duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated with lhrh agonists according to local clinical 
 practice.
 3special populationsrenal impairmentno dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 30 ml/min). safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these 
 patients (see section 4.4).
 hepatic impairmentno dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).
 paediatric populationthe safety and efficacy of faslodex in children from birth to 18 years of age have not been established. currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
 posology can be made.
 method of administration
 faslodex should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular injection 
 (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock (gluteal area).
 caution should be taken if injecting faslodex at the dorsogluteal site due to the proximity of the 
 underlying sciatic nerve.
 for detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header>4.3contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).
 severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>faslodex should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).
 faslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 less than 30 ml/min). 
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, faslodex should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical studies with faslodex (see section 4.8). this should be taken into 
 consideration when prescribing faslodex to patients at risk.
 injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy 
 have been reported with faslodex injection. caution should be taken while administering faslodex at 
 the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve (see sections 4.2 and 
 4.8).
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. due to the mechanism of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.
 4the efficacy and safety of faslodex (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease.
 when faslodex is combined with palbociclib, please also refer to the summary of product 
 characteristics of palbociclib.
 interference with estradiol antibody assaysdue to the structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant may interfere with antibodybased-estradiol assays and may result in falsely increased levels of estradiol.
 ethanolfaslodex contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol) as an excipient, i.e. up to 500 mg per injection, equivalent to 10 ml beer or 4 ml wine. this may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and 
 should be taken into account in high risk groups such as patients with liver disease and epilepsy.
 benzyl alcoholfaslodex contains benzyl alcohol as an excipient which may cause allergic reactions.paediatric population
 faslodex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not been 
 established in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of cyp3a4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp3a4. clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp3a4) and 
 ketoconazole (inhibitor of cyp3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. 
 dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and cyp3a4 
 inhibitors or inducers concomitantly.</p></section><section><header>4.6fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potentialpatients of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception while on treatment.
 pregnancy
 faslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). fulvestrant has been shown to cross the 
 placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. studies in animals have shown reproductive 
 toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). if 
 pregnancy occurs while taking faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.
 breast-feeding
 breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with faslodex. fulvestrant is excreted in milk in 
 lactating rats. it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. considering the potential 
 for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is 
 contraindicated (see section 4.3).
 fertility
 the effects of faslodex on fertility in humans has not been studied.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>faslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. however, since asthenia has been reported very commonly with faslodex, caution should be observed by those 
 patients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.
 5</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profilemonotherapythis section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical studies, post-marketing studies or spontaneous reports. in the pooled dataset of fulvestrant monotherapy, the most frequently 
 reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic 
 enzymes (alt, ast, alp).
 in table 1, the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (adrs) were calculated 
 based on the faslodex 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared 
 faslodex 500 mg with faslodex 250 mg [confirm (study d6997c00002), finder 1 (study 
 d6997c00004), finder 2 (study d6997c00006), and newest (study d6997c00003) studies], or 
 from falcon (study d699bc00001) alone that compared faslodex 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg. 
 where frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and falcon, the highest frequency is 
 presented. the frequencies in table 1 were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of 
 the investigator assessment of causality. the median duration of fulvestrant 500 mg treatment across 
 the pooled dataset (including the studies mentioned above plus falcon) was 6.5 months.
 tabulated list of adverse reactions
 adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (soc). 
 frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), 
 common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100). within each frequency grouping 
 adverse reactions are reported in order of decreasing seriousness.</p></section><section><header>table 1adverse drug reactions reported in patients treated with faslodex monotherapy</header></section><section><header>adverse reactions by system organ class and frequency</header><p>infections and infestationscommon

 cthe event was not observed in major clinical studies (confirm, finder 1, finder 2, newest). the frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate. 
 this is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the number of patients in the major clinical studies), which 
 equates to a frequency category of ‘uncommon’.
 dincludes: arthralgia, and less frequently musculoskeletal pain, myalgia and pain in extremity.efrequency category differs between pooled safety dataset and falcon.fadr was not observed in falcon.description of selected adverse reactionsthe descriptions included below are based on the safety analysis set of 228 patients who received at 
 least one (1) dose of fulvestrant and 232 patients who received at least one (1) dose of anastrozole, 
 respectively in the phase 3 falcon study.
 joint and musculoskeletal painin the falcon study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint andmusculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, 
 respectively. of the 65 patients in the faslodex arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and 
 musculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the first 
 3 months of treatment. no patients reported events that were ctcae grade ≥3 or that required a dose 
 reduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions.
 combination therapy with palbociclibthe overall safety profile of fulvestrant when used in combination with palbociclib is based on data from 517 patients with hr-positive, her2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the 
 randomised paloma3 study (see section 5.1).</p><p>the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any 
 grade reported in patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib were neutropenia, 
 leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anaemia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia. the 
 most common (≥2%) grade ≥3 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, infections, 
 ast increased, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. 
 table 2 reports the adverse reactions from paloma3.
 median duration of exposure to fulvestrant was 11.2 months in the fulvestrant + palbociclib arm and 
 4.9 months in the fulvestrant + placebo arm. median duration of exposure to palbociclib in the 
 fulvestrant + palbociclib arm was 10.8 months.</p></section><section><header>table 2 adverse reactions based on paloma3 study (n=517)system organ class

 8description of selected adverse reactionsneutropeniain patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib in the paloma3 study, neutropenia of any grade was reported in 287 (83.2%) patients, with grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 191 
 (55.4%) patients, and grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 37 (10.7%) patients. in the fulvestrant + 
 placebo arm (n=172), neutropenia of any grade was reported in 7 (4.1%) patients, with grade 3
 neutropenia reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. there were no reports of grade 4 neutropenia in the 
 fulvestrant + placebo arm.
 in patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib, the median time to first episode of 
 any grade neutropenia was 15 days (range: 13-317) and the median duration of grade ≥3 neutropenia 
 was 7 days. febrile neutropenia has been reported in 0.9% patients receiving fulvestrant in 
 combination with palbociclib.
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v
 .</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>there are isolated reports of overdose with faslodex in humans. if overdose occurs, symptomaticsupportive treatment is recommended. animal studies suggest that no effects other than those related 
 directly or indirectly to antiestrogenic activity were evident with higher doses of fulvestrant (see 
 section 5.3).</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1 
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, antiestrogens, atc code: l02ba03 mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects
 fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
 fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
 the mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. 
 clinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
 significantly downregulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was also 
 a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen 
 agonist effects. it has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates er and the proliferation 
 marker ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal 
 neoadjuvant setting.
 clinical efficacy and safety in advanced breast cancer
 monotherapya phase 3 clinical study was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine 
 therapy for advanced disease. the study included 423 patients whose disease had recurred or 
 progressed during antiestrogen therapy (ae subgroup) and 313 patients whose disease had recurred or 
 progressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (ai subgroup). this study compared the efficacy and 
 safety of faslodex 500 mg (n=362) with faslodex 250 mg (n=374). progression-free survival (pfs) 
 was the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (orr), 
 9clinical benefit rate (cbr) and overall survival (os). efficacy results for the confirm study are summarized in table 3.</p></section><section><header>table 3summary of results of the primary efficacy endpoint (pfs) and key secondary

 a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study of faslodex 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg was conducted in postmenopausal women with er-positive and/or pgr-positive 
 10locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy. a total of 462 patients were randomised 1:1 sequentially to receive either fulvestrant 500 mg 
 or anastrozole 1 mg.
 randomisation was stratified by disease setting (locally advanced or metastatic), prior chemotherapy 
 for advanced disease, and measurable disease.
 the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was investigator assessed progression-free survival (pfs) 
 evaluated according to recist 1.1 (response evaluation criteria in solid tumours). key secondary 
 efficacy endpoints included overall survival (os) and objective response rate (orr).
 patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90). the majority of patients 
 (87.0%) had metastatic disease at baseline. fifty-five percent (55.0%) of patients had visceral 
 metastasis at baseline. a total of 17.1% of patients received a prior chemotherapy regimen for 
 advanced disease; 84.2% of patients had measurable disease.
 consistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. for the 
 subgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral metastasis (n=208), the hr was 0.592 (95%

 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. seventy seven percent (77%) of the study 
 population had estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. these studies compared the safety and 
 efficacy of monthly administration of faslodex 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg 
 anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). overall, faslodex at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as 
 effective as anastrozole in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and time to death. 
 there were no statistically significant differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment 
 groups. progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. combined analysis of both studies
 showed that 83% of patients who received faslodex progressed, compared with 85% of patients who 
 received anastrozole. combined analysis of both studies showed the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg 
 to anastrozole for progression-free survival was 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10). the objective response 
 rate for faslodex 250 mg was 19.2% compared with 16.5% for anastrozole. the median time to death 
 was 27.4 months for patients treated with faslodex and 27.6 months for patients treated with 
 anastrozole. the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci 
 0.86 to 1.19).
 combination therapy with palbocicliba phase 3, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study of faslodex500 mg plus palbociclib 125 mg versus faslodex 500 mg plus placebo was conducted in women with 
 hr-positive, her2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or radiation 
 therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose 
 disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo) adjuvant or metastatic setting.
 a total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months from 
 completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy for 
 advanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to faslodex plus palbociclib or faslodex plus placebo and 
 stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry

 12massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study.
 patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
 deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
 crossover between treatment arms was not allowed.
 patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
 faslodex plus palbociclib arm and the faslodex plus placebo arm. the median age of patients enrolled 
 in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). in each treatment arm the majority of patients were 
 white, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. 
 approximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. all patients had received prior systemic 
 therapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for 
 their primary diagnosis. more than half (62%) had an ecog ps of 0, 60% had visceral metastases,
 and 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis.
 the primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed pfs evaluated according to recist 1.1. 
 supportive pfs analyses were based on an independent central radiology review. secondary 
 endpoints included or, cbr, os, safety, and time-to-deterioration (ttd) in pain endpoint.
 the study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed pfs at the interim analysis 
 conducted on 82% of the planned pfs events; the results crossed the pre-specified haybittle-peto 
 efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in pfs and a 
 clinically meaningful treatment effect. a more mature update of efficacy data is reported in table 5.</p></section><section><header>table 5efficacy results – paloma3 study (investigator assessment, intent-to-treat

 patient-reported symptoms were assessed using the european organization for research and treatment of cancer (eortc) quality of life questionnaire (qlq)-c30 and its breast cancer module 
 (eortc qlq-br23). a total of 335 patients in the faslodex plus palbociclib arm and 166 patients in 
 the faslodex plus placebo arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline 
 visit.
 14time-to-deterioration was pre-specified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥10 points increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. addition of palbociclib to faslodex resulted in a 
 symptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-deterioration in pain symptom compared with 
 faslodex plus placebo (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; hr of 0.64 [95% ci: 0.49, 0.85]; 
 p&lt;0.001).
 effects on the postmenopausal endometriumpreclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium (see section 5.3). a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day 
 ethinylestradiol showed that pretreatment with faslodex 250 mg resulted in significantly reduced 
 stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged 
 by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness.
 neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either faslodex 
 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial thickness, 
 indicating a lack of agonist effect. there is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the breast 
 cancer patients studied. no data are available regarding endometrial morphology.
 in two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
 disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measurement 
 between fulvestrant and placebo groups.
 effects on bonethere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either faslodex 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in 
 clinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers.
 paediatric population
 faslodex is not indicated for use in children. the european medicines agency has waived the 
 obligation to submit the results of studies with faslodex in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
 breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
 an open-label phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant in 
 30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with progressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright 
 syndrome (mas). the paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant. 
 this 12-month study investigated a range of mas endpoints and showed a reduction in the frequency 
 of vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. the steady-state trough 
 concentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that in adults (see 
 section 5.2). there were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-year data are yet 
 not available.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption after administration of faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed 
 and maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) are reached after about 5 days. administration of faslodex 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month 
 of dosing (mean [cv]: auc 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, c
 max 25.1 [35.3%] ng/ml, cmin16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained within a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and 
 trough concentrations. after intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately 
 dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg.
 distribution
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. the large apparent volume of distribution at 
 steady state (vd
 ss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. 15fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. very low density lipoprotein (vldl), low density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are the major binding 
 components. no interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. the role of sex 
 hormone-binding globulin (shbg) has not been determined.
 biotransformation
 the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of 
 possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. identified metabolites 
 (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or 
 exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in antiestrogen models. studies using human liver preparations 
 and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme involved in the 
 oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo. in vitrodata suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes.elimination
 fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. the major route of excretion is via the faeces, 
 with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) after intramuscular administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.
 special populations
 in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase 3 studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s 
 pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.
 renal impairmentmild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.
 hepatic impairmentthe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical study conducted in women with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b). a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold increase 
 in auc in women with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. in patients administered 
 faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated. women with 
 severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) were not evaluated.
 paediatric populationthe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 30 girls withprogressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright syndrome (see section 5.1). the 
 paediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of 
 fulvestrant. the geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (c
 min,ss) and auc
 ss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/ml and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/ml, respectively. although the data collected were limited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to be consistent with 
 those in adults.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies. local reactions, including myositis and granulomata at the injection site were attributed 
 to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to the saline 
 control. in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, the 
 antiestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in the 
 16female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes. arteritis involving a range of different tissues was seen in some dogs after chronic (12 months) dosing.
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen. these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt;15 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.
 fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential.
 fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
 antiestrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats, a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed. rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in 
 placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence of 
 foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae).
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males. in a two-year mouse 
 oncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of ovarian sex cord 
 stromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. at the no-effect 
 level for these findings, systemic exposure levels (auc) were, in rats, approximately 1.5–fold the 
 expected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-fold 
 the expected human exposure levels in both males and females. induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by 
 antiestrogens in cycling animals. therefore these findings are not considered to be relevant to the use 
 of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.
 environmental risk assessment (era)
 environmental risk assessment studies have shown that fulvestrant may have potential to cause 
 adverse effects to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6).</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars
