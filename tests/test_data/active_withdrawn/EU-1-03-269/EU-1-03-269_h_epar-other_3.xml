 introduction</header><p>fulvestrant is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen 
 therapy or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. the marketing authorisation was 
 granted on 10 march 2004. 
 fulvestrant is an anti-estrogen without agonist properties. it blocks the trophic actions of estrogens 
 without itself having any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity on the endometrium of post-
 menopausal women. fulvestrant binds to estrogen receptor (er) in a competitive manner with a high 
 affinity comparable with that of oestradiol. 
 the recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given 
 two weeks after the initial dose. it is a long acting (la) injection, designed to deliver the required dose 
 of 500 mg of fulvestrant over a 1 month period from two consecutive 5 ml injections (pre-filled 
 syringes contains 250 mg fulvestrant in 5 ml solution) by slow intramuscular injection (1-2 
 minutes/injection), one in each</p><p>buttock. 
 in this application, the mah re-evaluated data from a previously submitted pivotal study confirm 
 (assessed by chmp as part of fum 005), as well as supportive studies newest and finder1/finder2 
 (assessed as part of fum 006 and type ii-17 respectively), to support an extension of indication to 
 include patients who have failed on aromatase inhibitor therapy. considering that the extension of 
 indication was not approvable by the chmp, the mah agreed on an update of the section 5.1 in regards 
 to the data submitted. 
 in addition, the mah proposed to remove information on potential risk of osteoporosis in section 4.4 of 
 the smpc, and to include data from the newest study relating to mechanism of action, effects on 
 bone and postmenopausal endometrium in section 5.1 of the smpc. furthermore, the mah proposed 
 to remove information on ‘venous thromboembolism’ from sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the smpc.</p></section><section><header>information on paediatric requirements</header><p>pursuant to article 8 of regulation (ec) n° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an ema decision (p/146/2009) on the granting of a class waiver.</p></section><section><header n="1.2">1.2.  
 non-clinical aspects</header><p>no new pre-clinical toxicity studies have been submitted in this application, however the highest dose levels used in the preclinical toxicological studies conducted for the original application (250 mg/month) 
 corresponded to exposure ratios of 2-5 times the ones expected upon the proposed human maximal 
 dose (500 mg/month). the safety margins achieved at the no observed adverse effect levels 
 (noael’s) in these studies against the 500 mg dose used in the current variation are summarised in

 findings were not considered related to treatment, in part because these changes may be related to 
 the specific strain of beagle dogs used, however the chmp was of the opinion that a treatment related 
 effect could not be totally excluded and information regarding these findings has been added to section 
 5.3 of the spc. in addition &apos;vasculitis&apos; is currently included as a potential risk within the fulvestrant eu 
 rmp.</p></section><section><header n="1.3">1.3.  
 clinical aspects</header><p>the confirm study (d66997c00002 [9238il/0064]), a phase iii, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of the er antagonist fulvestrant in post-
 menopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor positive disease, who have relapsed or 
 progressed on prior endocrine therapy. the study was assessed by chmp as part of fum 005 and was 
 the basis to support an extension of the indication to include patients who have failed on prior 
 aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
 in addition data from three phase ii studies were assessed during the review. two of these, finder1 
 and finder2, included patient populations relevant to the sought indication, whereas newest studied 
 fulvestrant in another setting. unlike the confirm study which included patients with non-measurable 
 as well as measurable disease, the finder studies only included patients with measurable disease. 
 the finder studies also included a treatment arm denoted as the 250 mg loading dose regimen 
 (250mg + ld).

 changes relating to the mechanism of action, effects on bone and postmenopausal endometrium in 
 section 5.1. this data had been previously assessed by chmp as part of fum 006. 
 the newest study was a randomised, open-label, phase ii multicentre study in postmenopausal 
 women with newly diagnosed er+ breast cancer. the study incorporated a screening phase, a 
 treatment phase, a study completion visit at week 16 (unless treatment discontinuation criteria were 
 met earlier), surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving) for tumour removal, and a follow-up safety 
 visit 8 weeks after surgery or on their 6
 th visit (as applicable). the targeted population included women with histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive er+ 
 breast cancer who were postmenopausal as defined by one of the following criterion: (1) ≥60 years old, 
 (2) ≥45 years old with amenorrhea for at least 12 months and an intact uterus, (3) history of bilateral 
 oophorectomy, or (4) estradiol and follicle-stimulating-hormone (fsh) levels in the postmenopausal 
 range (as determined by the testing laboratory). tumors had to be newly diagnosed and either 
 operable or potentially operable depending on the degree of advancement; the largest tumour 
 diameter had to measure at least 2 cm. (acceptable tnm classifications were t2, 3, 4b, n0-3, m0). 
 patients also had to have a world health organization (who) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and be 
 willing to undergo biopsies and surgery as outlined in the protocol. patients with more than 2 major</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 page 5</p><p>tumour nodules or metastatic disease and patients previously treated for breast cancer were not eligible for study participation. additional criteria excluded patients with conditions that could 
 potentially interfere with efficacy evaluations or pose unacceptable health risks. 
 patients who met study entry criteria were assigned to 1 of 2 randomised treatments: either 
 fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly (im) every 28 days, with a supplemental loading dose given on day 
 14 (total of 5 doses) or fulvestrant 250 mg im every 28 days (total of 4 doses). treatment at each 
 dosage extended across a 16-week period. patients assigned to the 500-mg dosage received 2 
 injections on days 0, 14, 28, 56, and 84. patients assigned to the 250-mg dosage received single 
 injections on days 0, 28, 56, and 84.</p><p>
 the primary objective was to compare the effects of fulvestrant 500 mg and fulvestrant 250 mg on the 
 proliferation marker ki67 after 4 weeks of treatment. secondary objectives were to compare the 
 tolerability of fulvestrant 500 mg with that of fulvestrant 250 mg; to compare the effects of fulvestrant 
 500 mg and fulvestrant 250 mg on serum bone markers, endometrial thickness, and uterine 
 dimensions; to assess the correlation between changes in ki67 labeling index (li) and changes in 
 estrogen-receptor (er) expression and progesterone-receptor (pgr) expression; to compare the 
 effects of fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg on tumour response assessed by ultrasound; to compare actual 
 surgery performed at 16 weeks with the baseline-predicted feasible surgery for each treatment group; 
 and to correlate response after 16 weeks of treatment with biological endpoints detected after 4 and 
 16 weeks of treatment. 
 criteria for evaluation (main endpoints): 
 - primary endpoint: ki67 li at week 4 (change from baseline) 
 - secondary endpoints: changes from baseline in er index, pgr index, and ki67 li (at weeks 4 and 
 16); tumour response rate as assessed by changes in tumour volume (per ultrasound); extent of 
 breast surgery; change from baseline in ki67 li, er index, pgr index, and her-2, by responder status 
 at week 16; responder status at week 16 by her-1 and her-2 expression at baseline. 
 sample size was calculated relative to change in ki67 li from baseline to week 4. using a standard 
 deviation of 0.616% (taken from an earlier study, which looked at pre- and post dose ki67 li after a 
 single 250-mg dose of fulvestrant), 80 patients per treatment group were required to provide 80% 
 power to detect a 24% decrease in ki67 li at week 4 for fulvestrant 500 mg relative to fulvestrant 250 
 mg at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
 the population assigned to randomised treatment (itt) comprised 211 women enrolled from 36 
 investigational sites. patients were assigned to treatment as follows: 109 to treatment with fulvestrant 
 500 mg and 102 to treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg.</p></section><section><header>mechanism of action (ki67 and er)</header><p>results from the neoadjuvant newest study were the basis for the mah proposal to include data in section 5.1 of the smpc regarding mechanism of action, i.e. effect on proliferation marker ki67 and 
 the estrogen receptor (er). 
 ki67 
 the fulvestrant 500-mg regimen reduced ki67 li to a significantly greater extent, compared with 
 fulvestrant 250 mg (mean % change: –78.8% vs. –47.4%, respectively, p&lt;0.0001) after 4 weeks of 
 treatment. at week 16, reduction in ki67 li was still greater at the higher dosage (–77.4% and –
 62.8% for the 500- and 250-mg dosages, respectively) but, in an exploratory analysis, the difference 
 was not statistically significant (figure 1).</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 page 13</p><p> last therapy received prior to fulvestrant (aromatase inhibitor vs. anti-estrogen therapy) 
  measurable disease (yes vs. no) the secondary endpoints were analysed as follows: 
 - os was analysed by an unadjusted log-rank two-sided test.</p><p>
 - orr and cbr were analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment factor only. 
 - dor and docb were analysed in those patients who received an or or cb, respectively.</p><p>
 - health related quality of life (hrqol) was studied using a longitudinal model including treatment and 
 other covariates. 
 an additional analysis of expected duration of response (edor) and expected duration of clinical 
 benefit (edocb) was performed by fitting a log-normal distribution to the durations. the edor/edocb 
 is calculated based on all patients and not only those who responded. the edor/edocb gives the 
 average probability of being in response/clinical benefit for all patients, thereby allowing formal and 
 unbiased comparison of treatments for dor/docb. 
 efficacy and hrqol endpoints were analysed according to the randomised treatment, using the full 
 analysis set (fas), and the subset of fas who took part in hrqol registration. objective response was 
 analysed in the evaluable for response set (ers), another subset of fas. safety endpoints were 
 analysed according to the treatment actually received, using the safety analysis set. the primary

 received. 
  the per protocol set (pps) included all treated patients who did not have any important protocol deviations or violations. exclusion from the pps was determined by a blinded medical 
 review of protocol deviations. (see below regarding type of deviations.) 
  the evaluable for response set (ers) included all randomised patients (regardless of whether any study treatment was received) for whom objective response could be assessed. the reason 
 for exclusion from evaluable for response set was no target lesion at baseline. 
  additionally, hrqol was analysed in a subset of the fas consisting of women from english and spanish speaking countries, italy and brazil since the fact-b questionnaire used to assess this 
 endpoint was readily available in relevant languages for these countries.

 25.1 and 22.8 months in the two treatment groups, respectively (see table 14). a kaplan-meier plot is 
 shown in figure 4.</p><p>
 the hazard ratio for death in the unadjusted log-rank analysis was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 
 0.69 – 1.03), p= 0.091. a retrospective analysis of os, adjusted for the 6 predefined baseline

 the on-treatment hrqol in both treatment arms was good (mean toi score of approximately 60 out 
 of 92). patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg had a similar on-treatment hrqol to patients treated 
 with fulvestrant 250 mg and there were no statistically significant differences between the two 
 treatment groups in terms of change in on treatment hrqol as measured by both the toi and fact-b 
 score, although there was a numerical advantage in toi in favour of fulvestrant 500 mg.</p></section><section><header>effect of fulvestrant after failure on anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor therapy</header><p>in comparison, the corresponding hazard ratio for ttp in the subgroup of patients who progressed/relapsed during ongoing aromatase inhibitor (ai) or anti-estrogen (ao) therapy was 0.80 
 with 2-sided 95% ci: 0.68; 0.94 (p= 0.006). the effect of fulvestrant after aromatase inhibitor versus

 page 23</p><p>table 15. comparison of exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints in confirm by last endocrine therapy subgroup.</p><p>
 the types of response differed between the ai and the ao groups, with 2.8 % complete responses (cr) 
 in the 500 mg group and 0.7% in the 250 mg group following ao, compared with no crs following ai. 
 the rates of partial response (pr) were also higher following ao: 15.3% and 18.4% in the 500 mg and 
 250 mg groups, respectively, compared with 7.3% and 8.3% following ai. the rates of stable disease 
 in the evaluable for response set were similar following ao and ai; ao, 41.0% and 39.5%, ai, 40.6% 
 and 39.4%, in the 500 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively. 
 the treatment effect of fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg was consistent in patients who had 
 relapsed/progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy vs. antiestrogen therapy (see figure 5).</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 non-significant with p-values ≥0.3.</p><p>
 in response to chmp questions and in order to further increase the stringency regarding aromatase 
 inhibitor resistance, exploratory analyses of ttp and orr were performed which excluded the patients 
 who relapsed 0-12 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy. thus only patients who 
 progressed during ongoing endocrine therapy were included. analyses of patients subdivided with 
 regard to failure in the adjuvant or metastatic settings were also performed (tables 16 and 17).</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 the mah was also requested to provide further data on the efficacy of fulvestrant in the following 
 subgroups of subjects with ai as last endocrine therapy in confirm: a) different prior lines of 
 endocrine therapies (e.g. ai vs. ao followed by ai) and b) different ai regimen as last therapy (non-

 respectively. the weight differed considerably from the japanese study, with median weights at 71 and 
 68 kg in the two treatment groups, respectively. ethnicity was 98% caucasian.</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 page 29</p><p>in finder1 the patients in the 500 mg group were more heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy (70%) and radiotherapy (45%) than those in the 250 mg group (56% and 33%, respectively).</p><p>
 similar proportions of the patients who had received prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were seen in 
 finder2 and finder1, but different drugs were used. letrozole was not used in finder1. 
 last prior endocrine therapy was an aromatase inhibitor in approximately 80% of both treatment arms 
 in finder1, and 76 vs. 66% in the 500 mg vs. 250 mg arms in finder2. 
 the expected proportion of patients with moderately differentiated &gt; poorly differentiated &gt; well 
 differentiated tumours which was present in confirm was also present in both treatment arms of 
 finder1, but not in finder2 where the 250 mg group had a higher proportion than expected of 
 patients with poorly differentiated tumours (34% vs. 31% moderately differentiated).</p><p>
 all patients were er positive and 2/3 of the patients were pgr positive in both studies (as in confirm).</p><p>
 metastatic disease was present in 99% of patients in finder1 and 97% in finder2 (98% in 
 confirm). the presence of visceral disease was lower in finder1 (58%) compared with finder2 
 (76%) and confirm (64%). 
 baseline data are similar to the main study confirm, with a few exceptions including (among others) 
 ethnicity and weight in finder1, and a higher frequency of aromatase inhibitor as last prior endocrine 
 therapy in both finder studies compared with confirm. 
 the primary objective of the two finder studies was orr, which was a secondary objective in the 
 confirm study.</p><p>
 the overall level of objective response and clinical benefit was similar in all three studies. none of the 
 studies showed statistically significant differences between treatment arms. no difference in orr or 
 cbr was seen between the two treatment arms in finder1. finder2 showed a numerical difference in 
 favour of the 500 mg regimen for both orr and cbr, whereas in confirm a relevant numerical 
 difference was seen only for cbr, however not statistically significant. 
 time to progression (ttp) was a secondary objective in the finder studies and primary objective in 
 confirm. kaplan-meier curves for ttp are shown in figure 5. the ttp data is based on 84% of 
 patients having progressed in the confirm study, compared with 66% and 71% in finder1 and 2, 
 respectively. the definition of ttp is equivalent to progression-free survival (pfs) in all three studies. 
 additional supportive studies apart from the main study (confirm) and finder1, finder2 and 
 newest described above were submitted in support of the application (see table 23).

 in response to chmp questions the</p><p>mah was asked to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg

 page 31</p><p>discussion on clinical efficacy one of the major drawbacks of the pivotal study was the fact that lack of adequate control (placebo) made it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant in subjects with ai as last endocrine therapy in 
 confirm. a trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose was not considered sufficient and there 
 was not enough evidence to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg should be regarded as 
 efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
 some imbalances were also observed at baseline between the endocrine subgroups (prior ai vs. prior 
 ao as last endocrine therapy) regarding the number of prior (endocrine) treatments, the disease 
 setting (adjuvant vs advanced) and age. these imbalances may partly explain the differences in 
 activity of fulvestrant in the endocrine subgroups. in addition it made extrapolation between the two 
 subgroups difficult. on the other hand, no mechanistic or other reasons were put forward in order to 
 support the notion that the efficacy shown in the ao group would provide support in the interpretation 
 of the results in the ai group. 
 further to the assessment of the data submitted in the variation application and in the responses to 
 the chmp requests for supplementary information, the chmp considered that efficacy data to support 
 an extension of indication in this patient population was insufficient. however the chmp considered 
 acceptable to include relevant data on patients who have failed on prior anti estrogen and aromatase 
 inhibitor therapy by subgroup in section 5.1 of the smpc as the information can be helpful for the 
 prescriber. in addition, the mah has committed to provide more mature data on overall survival as a

 left bronchopneumonia (ctcae grade 2), which started 232 days from start of treatment and 7 days 
 after discontinuation of study. transbronchial biopsies showed advanced interstitial fibrosis, with 
 presence of moderate dense inflammation infiltration, and without evidence of breast cancer 
 metastasis. microbiology tests were positive for haemophilius influenzae. the events were considered 
 serious due to hospitalisation. the patient was treated with moxifloxacin and was discharged from 
 hospital 9 days later; however, at the time of dco she had not yet recovered. the interstitial lung 
 disease was considered as causally related to study therapy by investigator. the patient had a medical 
 history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and had received prior chemotherapy, which could 
 have put the patient at risk of developing interstitial fibrosis. 
 in the 250 mg group a 63 year old woman experienced hypertension and generalised weakness, which 
 occurred 48 days from start of treatment and 19 days after last dose (day 1 cycle 2). she died 23 days

 joints, including synovial cells. astrazeneca’s worldwide safety database was searched up to 31 july 
 2009 for reports of joint disorders in patients receiving fulvestrant. this identified 113 events in 105 
 patients. 42.55% were serious.</p><p>
 in the first study, the frequency of joint disorders was higher in the fulvestrant 500 mg arm (13.9%, 
 [14/101]) compared with the anastrozole 1 mg arm (9.7%, [10/103]). a prospective, formal statistical 
 analysis was performed, which showed that the difference in the frequency of joint disorders between 
 the two arms was not statistically significant (p=0.391). joint pain/stiffness is listed as a common 
 adverse reaction for anastrozole.</p><p>
 in the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (confirm, 
 finder1, finder2 and newest), the frequency of joint disorders in each arm was: 
 500 mg arm: 12.1% (68/560 patients) 
 250 mg arm: 10.6% (60/567 patients) 
 in the clinical study reports for confirm, finder1 and finder, a broader group of meddra 
 preferred terms was included in the predefined adverse event of ‘joint disorders’ including the 
 preferred terms, back pain and neck pain. using this broader group of preferred terms, the frequency 
 of joint disorders in each arm of the pooled analysis was: 
 500 mg arm: 17.1% (96/560 patients) 
 250 mg arm: 17.5% (99/567 patients)</p><p>following a request for supplementary information the mah provided additional information on the 
 frequencies of joint disorders irrespective of causality (see table 31).</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 summarised the different possible pathomechanisms of joint disorders in postmenopausal women with 
 breast cancer, focusing on the possible role of estrogen in join symptoms. the lack of joint disorders 
 associated with the treatment of fulvestrant was convincingly demonstrated.</p></section><section><header>osteoporosis</header><p>pooled analysis were performed on the confirm, finder1, finder2, and newest studies, which all compare fulvestrant at 500mg and 250 mg dose regimens. the frequency of events of osteoporosis 
 and fractures are shown in table 32. no events of reduced bone mineral density or osteopenia were 
 reported. based on these data the mah initially requested to remove potential risk of osteoporosis from 
 the smpc section 4.4. and pl section 2.</p><p>

 page 38</p><p>there is no significant difference in the reporting of osteoporosis or fracture in the dose comparing studies, however it should be noted that the newest study (including over 200 patients) was an open 
 study with potential risk of bias in the reporting of adverse events. in newest 2 cases of osteoporosis 
 were seen in the 500 mg arm and none in the 250 mg arm. even when taking this into account no 
 clinically significant difference is seen in the osteoporosis related adverse events of the dose comparing 
 studies. 
 the potential mechanism for fulvestrant to cause osteoporosis is based on the down-regulation of the 
 estrogen receptor (er) by competitive binding to the er. both er-alpha and er-beta are present in 
 bone and estrogens acting on these receptors are known to decrease osteoclast and increase 
 osteoblast cell numbers thus increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption.</p><p>
 the request to remove the potential risk of osteoporosis from the smpc was not accepted due to the 
 fact that although bone turn-over markers in the newest study were unaffected by 16 weeks of 
 treatment with fulvestrant (see section on bone biomarkers, tables 2, 3 and 4), the ability of the bone 
 turn-over marker study to detect long-term effects on bone was questioned and the potential risk of 
 osteoporosis could not be discarded. nevertheless section 5.1 has been updated to reflect the data 
 provided for the newest study.</p></section><section><header>venous thromboembolism</header><p>based primarily on data from the confirm study and nine supportive clinical trials (see table 22)</p><p>the mah requested to remove venous thromboembolism from the precautions for use and the list of 
 adverse drug reactions in the smpc sections 4.4. and 4.8 and pl section 2.</p><p>
 the experience of venous thromboembolism and fulvestrant and the frequency of such events are 
 summarised in tables 33 and 34.</p><p>
 table 33. incidence of venous thromboembolic events in fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg studies</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p> 
 ema/688361/2010</p><p>
 page 39</p><p>table 34. incidence of venous thromboembolic events in other fulvestrant studies</p><p>
 the mah also referred to published literature in which the frequency of deep venous thrombosis (dvt) 
 and pulmonary embolism (pe) in patients with and without cancer using sampled data from the 
 national hospital discharge survey 1979-1999 was evaluated. in patients with breast cancer the 
 frequency of a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (defined as dvt or pe) was 1.7/100 
 hospitalisations, compared with 1.0/100 hospitalisations in patients without a cancer diagnosis. 
 a search has also been performed in astrazeneca’s worldwide safety database for venous 
 thromboembolism-related meddra preferred terms, which identified 103 reports describing 111 
 venous thromboembolic events. in 91 of the reports risk factors for the development of venous 
 thromboembolic events were present, and in three other reports concomitant medications that may 
 also have resulted in the events were present, i.e. megestrol, capecitabine, and tamoxifen, 
 respectively. these data from spontaneous reporting does however not rule out the possibility of 
 fulvestrant harbouring a thrombogenic effect. 
 quantitative signal detection for vte and fulvestrant has also been performed using the</p><p>astrazeneca’s 
 worldwide safety database and the fda aers database by calculating the empirical bayesian 
 geometric mean (ebgm) along with a 90% confidence interval (eb05 to eb95) and the astrazeneca 
 recommended signal threshold of eb05 ≥ 1.8. the relevant meddra preferred term which met the 
 astrazeneca’s criteria for a potential safety signal was pulmonary embolism, with eb05s of 1.9 in the 
 astrazeneca database and 2.7 in the fda database. 
 in addition, theoretical potential mechanisms by which fulvestrant might cause or contribute to the risk 
 of venous thromboembolism have been identified:</p><p>
 tissue factor pathway inhibitor-1(tfpi) is the physiological inhibitor of the tissue factor pathway of 
 coagulation. one in vitro study showed that protein levels of tfpi in human endothelial cell cultures 
 were reduced by the addition of the following compounds (at a concentration of 10nm): 17β-estradiol 
 (34% reduction), 17α-ethinylestradiol (21%), raloxifene (28%), tamoxifen (16%), and fulvestrant (9%</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p> 
 ema/688361/2010</p><p>
 page 40</p><p>reduction of tfpi). the cells used did not express the regular nuclear 66kda erα, but instead a 45 kda erα, which was not regulated by estrogens or er modulators. 
 based on available data the mah has not been able to prove or make plausible the absence of a causal 
 relationship in a situation where potential mechanisms for the adr exists. therefore the request 
 remove venous thromboembolism from the product information was not accepted.</p></section><section><header>increased risk of bleeding at the injection site</header><p>astrazeneca’s worldwide safety database was searched up to 31 july 2009 for reports of bleeding events at the injection site in patients receiving fulvestrant. this search identified 9 events (all non-
 serious) in 9 patients. the outcomes of the events were: recovered without sequelae (2 events), not 
 yet recovered (1 event) and unknown (6 events). 
 in the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (confirm, 
 finder1, finder2 and newest), there were 7 bleeding events at the injection site in the 500 mg 
 arm; the outcomes of these events were recovered (6 events) and not yet recovered (1 event). in the 
 250 mg arm, there were 2 events of bleeding at the injection site; the outcomes of these 2 events 
 were recovered. all 9 events were considered to be non-serious by the investigators. 
 in the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (confirm, 
 finder1, finder2 and newest), the frequency of bleeding events at the injection site in each arm 
 was: 
 500 mg arm: 1.3% (7/560 patients) 
 250 mg arm: 0.4% (2/567 patients) 
 risk factors for a bleeding event following intramuscular administration include the presence of 
 bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or concomitant treatment with anticoagulants. 
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, fulvestrant should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment (see 
 section 4.4 of the smpc). specific exclusion criteria and restrictions are in place for the studies 
 included in the fulvestrant clinical development programme. in addition, all events reported in at risk 
 patients are monitored to ensure that the warnings are adequate to reduce or manage patient risk. 
 the chmp considered that bleeding at the injection site is an important identified risk. in addition to 
 the existing warnings in the section 4.4 of the smpc regarding patients with bleeding diatheses, 
 thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment; the chmp considered necessary to include 
 bleeding at the injection site in the table of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the smpc.</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>there were no clinically relevant changes with time in median and mean haematology or clinical chemistry values in either of the treatment groups and no apparent differences between the treatment

 the proportion of patients reporting an abnormal haematology parameter at their treatment 
 discontinuation visit was 31.8% in the fulvestrant 500 mg group compared to 30.2% in the fulvestrant 
 250 mg group. 
 the proportion of patients reporting an abnormal clinical chemistry parameter at baseline was 57.6% 
 in the fulvestrant 500 mg group and 58.8% in the fulvestrant 250 mg group, compared with 67.4%

 500 mg group and 567 in the 250 mg group. the subgroups of patients ≥ 75 years of age comprised 
 81 and 96 patients, respectively. 
 in an analysis of patients who had at least 1 ae by system organ class, higher frequencies of the 
 following aes were seen in the 500 mg vs. the 250 mg group in the patients aged ≥ 75 years: general 
 disorders and injection site conditions (46% vs. 33%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (15% vs. 
 4%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (17% vs. 11,5%), injury, poisoning and procedural 
 complications (17% vs. 9%), ear and labyrinth disorders (5% vs.2 %). there was no difference 
 between treatment groups with regard to cardiac disorders (5% in both). 
 in an analysis of aes according to meddra preferred terms present in ≥ 5% of the patients, higher 
 frequencies of the following aes were seen in the 500 mg vs. the 250 mg group in the patients aged ≥ 
 75 years: fatigue (17% vs. 8%), injection site pain (12% vs. 4%), diarrhoea (9% vs. 3%). on the 
 other hand, the following aes were more common in the 250 mg group: vomiting, asthenia, back pain 
 and arthralgia. fatigue and injection site pain were also markedly higher in the 500 mg vs. 250 mg 
 group in the 65-74 year age group.</p><p>
 safety by race</p><p>
 a pooled safety analysis of the studies named above divided patients into one of three racial groups: 
 caucasian (n=974), oriental (n=99), and black (n=11).</p><p>vascular disorders and cardiac disorders 
 (soc) appeared in a higher frequency in black patients compared with the other races, however the 
 absolute numbers are low (n= 1-2). the frequencies of vascular disorders in the combined racial 
 groups were 14% in the 500 mg group vs. 16% in the 250 mg group, and the corresponding figures 
 for cardiac disorders were 3% in both groups. oriental patients reported overall more aes than the 
 other race groups, including (soc): general disorders and administration site conditions, 
 gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, skin and 
 subcutaneous tissue disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders. nasopharyngitis (meddra 
 pt ≥ 5%) was reported in oriental patients in 33 and 34% in the 500 mg and 250 mg groups, 
 respectively, and not at all (i.e. &lt;5%) in the other race groups. 
 there was a consistency between the caucasian and oriental groups in the most common aes (soc) 
 being: general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
 disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and infections and infestations.</p><p>
 discussion on clinical safety</p><p>the distribution of aes was well balanced between treatment groups. the average number of aes was 3 per patient in both groups, approximately 20 % were judged causally related (22 and 20 % in the 
 500 mg and 250 mg arms, respectively), approximately 10 % of the patients experienced saes (11 
 and 9%, respectively) and only one patient in each group had a causally related sae. the number of 
 patients with aes of ctc (common toxicity criteria) grade 3 or higher, and with outcome of death were 
 very similar. one patient died in a causally related ae in the 250 mg group. in addition, no clinically 
 meaningful differences in discontinuations were seen between treatment groups. 
 in conclusion the data presented gave no evidence of dose-dependent aes. specifically, there were no 
 increases in the two most common areas of ae, gi disturbances and joint disorders, or in 
 thromboembolic events with the higher dose regimen.</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p>

 benefit-risk balance</header><p>the benefit for fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to aromatase inhibitors has not been demonstrated. no statistically significant effect has been observed with fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg 
 in ttp in the subgroup of subjects who had used an aromatase inhibitor as last endocrine therapy in 
 the pivotal phase iii confirm study (ttp 250 mg 4.1 mo vs. ttp 500 mg 5.4 mo; hr=0.85 (ci 95% 
 0.67-1.08, p=0.195). in line with the ttp results, there is a trend for a better survival in patients 
 treated with fulvestrant 500 mg compared with the 250 mg group, however it was not statistically 
 significant. 
 although secondary endpoints have shown some activity for fulvestrant in terms of overall response 
 rate (orr) for the 500 mg (7.3%) and the 250 mg (8.3%) doses and clinical benefit (cbr) for the 500</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p> 
 ema/688361/2010</p><p>
 page 46</p><p>mg (36.2%) and the 250 mg (32.3%) dose, they were not considered firm evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit in the subgroup of subjects who had used an aromatase inhibitor as last endocrine 
 therapy in the confirm study.</p><p>in addition supportive phase ii studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg 
 vs 250 mg (finder1 and finder2) have not shown statistically signifficant difference in orr or cbr 
 between the two treatment arms. 
 one of the major drawbacks of the pivotal study confirm was the fact that lack of adequate control 
 (placebo) made it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant in subjects with ai as last endocrine 
 therapy. a trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose was not considered sufficient and there 
 was not enough evidence to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg should be regarded as 
 efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
 some imbalances were also observed at baseline between the endocrine subgroups (prior ai vs. prior 
 ao as last endocrine therapy) regarding the number of prior (endocrine) treatments, the disease 
 setting (adjuvant vs advanced) and age. these imbalances may partly explain the differences in 
 activity of fulvestrant in the endocrine subgroups. in addition it made extrapolation between the two 
 subgroups difficult. on the other hand, no mechanistic or other reasons were put forward in order to 
 support the notion that the efficacy shown in the ao group would provide support in the interpretation 
 of the results in the ai group. 
 in terms of toxicity the distribution of aes was well balanced between treatment groups. the average 
 number of aes was 3 per patient in both groups, approximately 20 % were judged causally related (22 
 and 20 % in the 500 mg and 250 mg arms, respectively), approximately 10 % of the patients 
 experienced saes (11 and 9%, respectively) and only one patient in each group had a causally related 
 sae. the number of patients with aes of ctc grade 3 or higher, and with outcome of death were very 
 similar. there were no increases in the two most common areas of ae, gi disturbances and joint 
 disorders, nor in thromboembolic events with the higher dose regimen. in conclusion there is not 
 additional toxicity associated with the 500 mg dose of fulvestrant compared to the lower 250 mg dose. 
 as per chmp request, an oncology scientific advisory group (sag) meeting was convened on 16 june 
 2010 to discuss the benefits of fulvestrant from a clinical perspective and whether fulvestrant at a dose 
 of 250 mg should be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. the sag 
 provided advice on the following questions raised by the committee:</p></section><section><header n="1">1. while some activity in terms of overall response rate (8%) has been shown for fulvestrant 250 mg, efficacy (=clinically meaningful activity) cannot be deduced. therefore 
 it is not sufficient only to demonstrate a trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose 
 (hr 0.85, 95% ci 0.67; 1.08). the sponsor is thus asked to justify why fulvestrant at a dose 
 of 250 mg should be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy.</header><p>the sag agreed by consensus that insufficient evidence of efficacy has been presented to establish that fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg can be regarded as efficacious in patients with disease 
 progression after aromatase inhibitors. the confirm trial was not designed to address this question 
 and only indirect comparisons can be made. the efficacy results for fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg do 
 not show any dramatic activity in terms of response rate, pfs or any of the clinical outcomes presented 
 and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn from indirect comparisons. thus, it is unknown if 
 fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg can be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor 
 therapy.</p><p>
 the sag agreed that formal evidence of efficacy should be provided according to rigorous scientific 
 standards to establish the efficacy of fulvestrant in patients with disease progression after aromatase 
 inhibitors. the best way to address this question is through randomised controlled trials.</p><p> procedure no.: emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018</p><p> 
 ema/688361/2010</p><p>
 page 47</p><p>nevertheless, some sag members argued that in view of the manageable toxicity profile, fulvestrant could be regarded as a possible option in this setting but this is not based on firm evidence, rather, on 
 clinical expert judgement of exploratory analyses suggesting some antitumour activity. the level of 
 evidence to support this currently does not fulfil conventional scientific standards, prompting the need 
 for confirmatory studies.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. please discuss the relevance of the evidence of efficacy demonstrated in patients failing anti-estrogens to patients failing aromatase inhibitors.</header><p>currently, there is no strong pharmacologic rationale to assume that tumour characteristics would be substantially different in patients with disease progression after aromatase inhibitors compared to 
 patients who progressed upon anti-estrogen therapy. however, there is also no strong rationale to 
 exclude that such differences exist. one would need to confirm this through adequate clinical trials.</p><p>
 concerning the confirm trial, there are substantial differences between the two populations in terms 
 of patient and disease characteristics (e.g., demographics, prior treatment) to make an extrapolation 
 difficult.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. considering the points discussed above, the mah is requested to review existing data on the efficacy and safety of available alternative treatment options (including chemotherapy) 
 after failure with ais and to discuss those findings in relation to the observed effects with 
 fulvestrant in subjects after failure with ai in confirm study.</header><p>the efficacy results for fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg do not show any dramatic activity in terms of response rate, pfs or any of the clinical outcomes presented and therefore no firm conclusions can be 
 drawn from direct or indirect comparisons with other treatment options. based on the exploratory 
 analyses presented, some antitumour activity has been observed but it is unknown to what extent this 
 would result in a meaningful clinical benefit or how this would compare to relevant treatment options 
 including “gentle” chemotherapy. 
 the chmp considered the data submitted and the argumentation put forward by the applicant and the 
 sag experts. based on the above findings, the chmp considered that the benefit-risk balance for 
 fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to aromatase inhibitors was not favourable and that the 
 therapeutic efficacy has not been properly and sufficiently demonstrated in order to support the 
 extension of the current approved indication in section 4.1 of the smpc . however the chmp 
 considered acceptable the inclusion of relevant data on patients who have failed on prior anti-estrogen 
 and aromatase inhibitor therapy by subgroup in section 5.1 of the smpc as the information can be 
 helpful for the prescriber.</p></section></body></xml>
