 no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>
 method of administration:</p><p>
 administer intramuscularly slowly into the buttock. for full administration instructions see 6.6.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>faslodex is contraindicated in:</p><p>• patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients</p><p>3• pregnancy and in breast-feeding (see</p><p>4.6) • severe hepatic impairment</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>use faslodex with caution in patients with mild to moderate, hepatic impairment (see</p><p>4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).</p><p>
 use faslodex with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 
 30 ml/min) (see 5.2).</p><p>
 due to the route of administration, use faslodex with caution if treating patients with bleeding 
 diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.</p><p>
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical trials (see 4.8). this should be taken into consideration when prescribing 
 faslodex to patients at risk.</p><p>
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone.</p><p>due to the mode of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp 3a4.</p><p> 
 clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp 3a4) and ketoconazole (inhibitor of 
 cyp 3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. dosage adjustment is 
 therefore not necessary in patients who are co-prescribed fulvestrant and cyp 3a4 inhibitors or 
 inducers.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>faslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see 4.3).</p><p>fulvestrant has been shown to cross the placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit.</p><p>studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity 
 including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see 5.3).</p><p>if pregnancy occurs 
 while taking faslodex the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus and potential 
 risk for loss of pregnancy.</p><p>
 fulvestrant is excreted in milk in lactating rats.</p><p>it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in 
 human milk.</p><p>considering the potential for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed 
 infants, breast-feeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>faslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. however, during treatment with faslodex, asthenia has been reported.</p><p>therefore caution must be observed by those 
 patients who experience this symptom when driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>approximately 47 % of patients experienced adverse reactions in the clinical trial programme.</p><p>however, only 0.9 % of patients stopped therapy because of an adverse reaction.</p><p>the most commonly

 if overdose occurs, manage symptomatically.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-oestrogen, atc code: l02ba03</p><p>5fulvestrant is an oestrogen receptor antagonist and binds to oestrogen receptors in a competitive manner with an affinity comparable with that of oestradiol. fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of 
 oestrogens without itself having any partial agonist (oestrogen-like) activity.</p><p>the mode of action is 
 associated with down-regulation of oestrogen receptor (er) protein.</p><p> 
 clinical trials in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
 significantly down-regulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo.</p><p>there was 
 also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic 
 oestrogen agonist effects.</p><p>
 effects on advanced breast cancer</p><p>
 two phase iii clinical trials were completed in a total of 851 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression 
 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. 77% of the study population had oestrogen 
 receptor positive breast cancer. these trials compared the safety and efficacy of monthly 
 administration of 250 mg fulvestrant with a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, at a 
 daily dose of 1 mg.</p><p>
 overall, fulvestrant at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of 
 time to progression, objective response, and time to death.</p><p>there were no statistically significant 
 differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment groups.</p><p>time to progression was the 
 primary endpoint.</p><p>combined analysis of both trials showed that 83% of patients who received 
 fulvestrant progressed, compared with 85% of patients who received anastrozole.</p><p>the hazard ratio of 
 fulvestrant to anastrozole for time to progression was 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10).</p><p>the objective 
 response rate for fulvestrant was 19.2% compared with 16.5% for anastrozole.</p><p>the median time to 
 death was 27.4 months for patients treated with fulvestrant and 27.6 months for patients treated with 
 anastrozole.</p><p>the hazard ratio of fulvestrant to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci 0.86 to 
 1.19).</p><p>analysis of results by er status showed that the use of fulvestrant should be restricted to 
 patients with er positive breast cancer.</p><p>
 effects on the postmenopausal endometrium</p><p>
 preclinical data suggest that fulvestrant will not have a stimulatory effect on the postmenopausal endometrium.</p><p>a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers showed that compared to 
 placebo, pre-treatment with 250 mg fulvestrant resulted in significantly reduced stimulation of the 
 postmenopausal endometrium, as judged by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness, in 
 volunteers treated with 20 micrograms per day ethinyl oestradiol.</p><p>
 there are no data on the long-term effects of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium.</p><p>no 
 data are available regarding endometrial morphology.</p><p>
 in two studies with premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic disease, no significant 
 differences in endometrial thickness were observed (measured with ultrasound) between fulvestrant 
 and placebo. however, the duration of treatment was short (1, and 12 weeks, respectively).</p><p>
 effects on bone</p><p>
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption:</p><p>
 after administration of faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed and maximum plasma concentrations are reached after about 7 days.</p><p>absorption continues for over 
 one month and monthly administration results in an approximate 2-fold accumulation. steady-state</p><p>6levels are reached after about 6 doses during monthly injections with the major part of the accumulation achieved after 3-4 doses.</p><p>the terminal half-life is governed by the absorption rate and 
 was estimated to be 50 days.</p><p>at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained within 
 a relatively narrow range with approximately 2- to 3-fold difference between maximum and trough 
 concentrations.</p><p>
 after intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately dose proportional in the dose range 
 50 to 250 mg.</p><p>
 distribution:</p><p>
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution.</p><p>the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is large (approximately 3 to 5 l/kg), which suggests that the compound distribution is 
 largely extravascular.</p><p>fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins.</p><p>very low density 
 lipoprotein (vldl), low density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are 
 the major binding components.</p><p>therefore no drug interaction studies were conducted on competitive 
 protein binding.</p><p>the role of sex hormone-binding globulin has not been determined.</p><p>
 metabolism:</p><p>
 the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids (includes 17-ketone, 
 sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites).</p><p>identified metabolites are either less active 
 or exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-oestrogen models.</p><p>studies using human liver 
 preparations and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp 3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme 
 involved in the oxidation of fulvestrant, however non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo
 . in vitro data suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes.</p><p>
 elimination:</p><p>
 fulvestrant is eliminated mainly by metabolism.</p><p>the major route of excretion is via the faeces with less than 1% being excreted in the urine.</p><p>fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio.</p><p>
 special populations:</p><p>
 in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase iii studies, no difference in fulvestrant pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.</p><p>
 renal impairment</p><p>mild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment</p><p>the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical trial conducted in subjects with child-pugh category a and b hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold 
 increase in auc in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.</p><p>in patients 
 administered faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated.</p><p>child-pugh category c subjects were not evaluated.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p> 7 the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.</p><p> 
 faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies.</p><p>local reactions, including myositis and granulomatoma at the injection site were 
 attributed to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to 
 the saline control.</p><p>in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and 
 dogs, the anti-oestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, 
 particularly in the female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both 
 sexes.</p><p>
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen.</p><p>these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt;40 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.</p><p>
 fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential. 
 fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its anti-
 oestrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed.</p><p>rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in 
 placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence 
 of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral 
 vertebrae).</p><p>
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males.</p><p>induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations.</p><p>these findings are not of 
 clinical relevance for the use of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>ethanol 96% benzyl alcohol</p><p>

 faslodex is a medicine that blocks some of the actions of the female sex hormone, oestrogen, within 
 the body. oestrogen is involved in maintaining the growth of organs such as the breast, uterus and 
 bone. oestrogen is linked to the growth of breast cancer.</p><p>
 faslodex comes in a container with a syringe that is filled and ready for injection into the muscle of 
 the buttock. each packaging contains a needle for injection.</p></section><section><header>before you use faslodex  do not have faslodex:</header><p>- if you know you are allergic to fulvestrant or to any of the ingredients in faslodex.
