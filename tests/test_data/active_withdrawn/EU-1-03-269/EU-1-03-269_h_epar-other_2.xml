 introduction</header><p>problem statement disease or condition breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and a leading cause of cancer mortality among 
 women in the us and europe. approximately 246,660 new cases of breast cancer are predicted this 
 year in the us (14.6% of all new cancers) and it is estimated that the disease will contribute to 40,450 
 deaths (acs 2016). in europe 92,300 deaths due to breast cancer are predicted for 2016 (malvezzi et 
 al 2016).</p><p>
 although treatable, metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease with a median overall 
 survival of 2–3 years and a 5-year survival of only 25% (esmo advanced breast cancer guideline). 
 management</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 8/59</p><p>
 treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. early or localized breast cancer is treated by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. adjuvant systemic therapy, consisting of 
 chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, in tumours deemed hormone responsive, can prolong the 
 disease-free interval and improve overall survival. however, approximately 30% to 40% of patients 
 with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse, with either local recurrence or distant metastases, and 
 require further systemic treatment for advanced disease.</p><p>
 current treatment guidelines emphasise the preferential use of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal 
 women with hr+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for 
 cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (cardoso et al 2014). the choice of 
 first-line endocrine therapy for hr+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and length of therapy 
 received in the adjuvant setting (if any). the endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, 
 selective estrogen receptor modulators (serm; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor antagonists (e.g. 
 fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (nsai; e.g. anastrozole and letrozole) and 
 steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane). these agents may be given in first, second or later 
 lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer (esmo guideline; nccn clinical practice guidelines in 
 oncology). fulvestrant is currently authorised for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally 
 advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease relapse on or after 
 adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy (see faslodex smpc). 
 clinical practice guidelines also refer to palbociclib, a cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) 4/6 inhibitor, that 
 has recently been approved as an add-on to endocrine therapy (see ibrance smpc). combination of 
 exemestane with everolimus is also an option in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral 
 disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (see afinitor 
 smpc).</p><p>
 primary or acquired resistance to initial endocrine therapy ultimately results in disease progression in a 
 large proportion of breast cancers. to overcome this initial resistance, sequential endocrine therapies 
 are used in the advanced disease setting (nccn 2016; rugo et al 2016; cardoso et al 2014).</p><p>
 about the product fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
 the mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. clinical 
 studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant significantly 
 downregulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was also a significant 
 decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen agonist 
 effects. 
 faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen 
 therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. 
 the recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given 
 two weeks after the initial dose. 
 type of application and aspects on development the applied indication was (new text underlined): “faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
 • not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 9/59</p><p>
 • for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen endocrine therapy, or disease progression on endocrine therapy with an anti-estrogen.” 
 the application for the new indication (endocrine naïve patients) is based on data from two studies: 
 • a supportive phase 2 study (study d6995c00006): open-label study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 205 women with advanced disease previously untreated with 
 endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (first) 
 • a pivotal phase 3 study (study d699bc00001): randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously been treated with any 
 hormonal therapy (falcon) 
 endocrine therapy naïve patients include those who have progressed after the management of early 
 disease that did not include adjuvant endocrine therapy, or patients who may present for the first time 
 with advanced disease. 
 the mah received scientific advice from the chmp on 22 november 2012 on clinical aspects 
 (ema/chmp/sawp/868022/2011) concerning the study population, double-blind design and pfs as 
 primary endpoint.</p><p> 
 the proposal to modify ‘anti-estrogen’ to ‘endocrine’ in the second line indication was based on a 
 justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results from the china 
 confirm study, the final overall survival (os) analysis of the confirm study and published literature, 
 to supplement existing clinical data from confirm, finder1 and finder2 in patients who have 
 progressed following an ai. 
 the recommended indication is: 
 faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women (new text underlined): 
 • not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or • for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen therapy.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.  
 non-clinical aspects</header><p>no new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application apart from the era (see section 2.2.1), which was considered acceptable by the chmp.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.1">2.2.1.  
 ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>an updated era was provided with this procedure. as an oestrogen receptor antagonist, the mechanism of action of fulvestrant has potential to affect 
 reproduction in aquatic species. in addition, the octanol:water partition coefficient (log pow) is &gt;4.5. 
 therefore, although the refined pecsurface water (0.00046 μg/l) is well below the phase i action limit 
 of 0.01 μg/l, a tailored phase ii assessment has been performed to address the potential mode of 
 action and bioaccumulation concerns. 
 in the tier a assessment the toxicity of fulvestrant to aquatic and groundwater species as well as 
 micro-organisms were assessed. the pec/pnec ratios for surface water and groundwater were below 1 
 and for microorganisms below 0.1.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 10/59</p><p>
 fulvestrant cannot be considered readily biodegradable, is poorly water soluble and has been shown to adsorb to physical surfaces. the potential for exposure of the terrestrial environment, via sludge 
 application to land, could not be excluded. however, the stp simulation test showed that fulvestrant is 
 expected to fully degrade and is unlikely to be present in the sewage sludge applied to land. therefore, 
 an assessment of the degradation rate in soil is not necessary as exposure of the terrestrial 
 environment is considered to be negligible, and a worst case risk assessment assuming no degradation 
 identified no terrestrial risks. 
 in the aquatic environment, fulvestrant, and its degradation products, are anticipated to partition into 
 aquatic sediments and undergo significant degradation. as such fulvestrant is not anticipated to be 
 persistent. 
 in tier b, the toxicity of fulvestrant to sediment dwelling and terrestrial species was assessed. the 
 pec/pnec ratios for sediment and the terrestrial environment were below 1. the octanol-water 
 partition coefficient, log pow, is &gt; 4.5, however the measured assessment of bioaccumulation 
 potential in fish, bcf &lt;357, demonstrates that fulvestrant is not bioaccumulative. 
 in conclusion, the risk to the environment as a consequence of the use of fulvestrant is low.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.2">2.2.2.

 hazard ratio (hr) for the comparison of fulvestrant vs. anastrozole was 0.69 (likely to correspond to a 
 45% prolongation of pfs) the study had 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference

 anastrozole is 13 months, a pfs hr of 0.69 may translate to a median pfs of 18.8 months on fulvestrant. the smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is pfs hr=0.80 
 (which translates to approximately a 3.3-month median difference, assuming proportional hazards and 
 an exponential distribution).</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>patients were randomised strictly sequentially, as patients were eligible for randomisation, to fulvestrant or anastrozole using a randomisation ratio 1:1.</p><p>

 the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. the safety analysis 
 set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomised treatment, including patients who 
 received only placebo (and no active treatment). 
 the overall one-sided type i error rate used was 2.5% (two-sided 5%). only if the primary endpoint 
 (pfs) is significant, the key secondary endpoints of overall survival (os) and objective response rate 
 (orr) were to be tested. a multiple testing procedure to strongly control type-i error at the overall 
 alpha level was implemented, and used to test the key secondary endpoints with an alpha-exhaustive 
 recycling strategy (burman et al 2009). with this approach, the endpoints of os and orr are tested in 
 a pre-defined order using a weighted proportion of alpha (such that initially 
 α=2% is allocated to os, and 
 α=0.5% is allocated to orr) and alpha that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to the secondary endpoint not yet rejected. other secondary endpoints were not included in 
 the multiple testing procedure.</p><p>
 pfs and orr were to be analysed at one time-point only, when approximately 306 progression events 
 have occurred. the date of data cut-off was 11 april 2016.</p><p>an interim analysis of os was conducted at the same time as the primary analysis of pfs. a more 
 mature os analysis was planned at a later time-point when it is estimated that 50% of patients will 
 have died. after this point, the patient&apos;s treatment will be unblinded. the false positive rate will be 
 controlled amongst the two os analyses by using the lan demets (lan and demets 1983) spending 
 function that approximates an o’brien fleming approach. it was estimated in the sample size 
 calculation that, in case that 0.7 of the full death information would be available (i.e., 159/225 deaths) 
 at the time of the interim os analysis, the 1-sided significance level to be applied for the os interim 
 analysis would be 0.0054. if the interim os is statistically significant, then orr will be assessed using</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 α=0.005. methods of analysis of the primary endpoint (pfs) and the key secondary endpoints (os and orr) are

 changes to planned analyses: 
 • pre-unblinding changes to the planned analyses, as described in the csp and/or in the original sap (edition 1, dated 28 june 2012), were as follows: 
 • inclusion of more geographic regions for subgroup analysis of pfs and more levels of geographic region in the covariate used for the cox regression sensitivity analysis of pfs. 
 • inclusion of visceral disease (yes/no) for subgroup analysis of pfs and as a covariate used for the cox regression sensitivity analysis of pfs. 
 • expanded the bisphosphonate use at baseline subgroup to include denosumab use. • inclusion of subgroup analysis and cox regression sensitivity analysis for os. • adjustment to the analysis method for pfs by subgroup to an unstratified log-rank test. • inclusion of rules for the removal of 1 stratification factor from the analysis models for log-rank and logistic regression due to small sub-strata. 
 • removal of the inferential statistical analysis for other significant aes of interest (pre-specified aes). 
 there was 1 post-unblinding change to the planned analyses, which was as follows: 
 • inclusion of an additional sensitivity analysis of pfs, which fitted stratification factors derived from the ecrf data (rather than the ivrs system). 
 post-hoc sensitivity analyses performed by: • fitting stratification factors derived from electronic case report form data (rather than on the ivrs system), in order to investigate any effect of mis-stratification on the primary endpoint of 
 the study, and 
 • including all 3 randomisation stratification factors (i.e., adding locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer) in the primary statistical model. 
 in addition, analyses have been performed to explore if any potential bias was introduced by censoring 
 that is both related to outcome and imbalanced between the treatment arms. multiple imputation was 
 performed using a cox model to impute event times in subjects who were censored early (i.e., at more 
 than 12 weeks before the data cut-off for the primary analysis). imputations were performed in such 
 way that:</p><p>
 • the hazard for progression increases after censoring in both arms, suggesting the censoring was related to outcome and was not at random, and</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 19/59</p><p>
 • the hazard increases following censoring in the fulvestrant arm only.</p><p>
 protocol deviations 
 a larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had at least 1 important protocol deviation 
 compared with the anastrozole arm (45.2% vs 33.6%).</p><p> 
 a higher proportions of patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm were randomised 
 using an incorrect stratification factor (i.e., mis-stratification in 20.0% vs 16.8% of patients) and 
 recist timing (14.8% vs 9.5% of patients), respectively. 
 mis-stratification was driven by the prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
 stratum: overall, 47 (10.2%) patients were assigned as having received prior chemotherapy of these, 
 the vast majority (45) were actually recorded as having prior chemotherapy for early disease 
 (neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant) on the ecrf.</p><p>a further 4 (0.9%) patients were assigned as having 
 received no prior chemotherapy on the ivrs system, but reported as having received prior 
 chemotherapy on the ecrf. 
 although patients were mis-stratified slightly more frequently in the fulvestrant arm (20.0%) relative 
 to the anastrozole arm (16.8%), the incidence of discordance between those data captured on the 
 ivrs system at randomisation and those captured on the ecrf was similar in both treatment arms 
 across all 3 stratification factors.</p></section><section><header>baseline data</header><p>patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90) (see table 5). table 2: demographic characteristics: falcon itt analysis set</p><p>number (%) of subjects demographic characteristic

 design 
 falcon was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, international, 
 multicenter phase iii study, designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability 
 of fulvestrant (500 mg) with anastrozole (1 mg) in postmenopausal women 
 with hormone receptor-positive (hr +ve) locally advanced or metastatic 
 breast cancer (confirmed by histology), who had not previously been treated 
 with any hormonal therapy. patients were assessed for eligibility for the study 
 based on local laboratory results for hormone receptor status.</p><p>
 to maintain the double-blind, double-dummy design of the trial, each patient 
 received both study treatments, 1 of which was placebo.

 e.g., uncontrolled cardiac disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. 
 treatment fulvestrant (faslodex) 500 mg was administered as two 5 ml intramuscular injections on days 0, 14 (±3), 28 (±3) and every 28 (±3) days thereafter with time windows extending to ±7 days after 24 
 weeks. 
 anastrozole (arimidex) 1 mg was administered orally as a single daily tablet. 
 treatment continued until disease progression as per recist, unless any of the criteria for treatment 
 discontinuation were met first. 
 objectives the primary objective was to compare the cbr in patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg with the cbr in patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.</p><p>
 outcomes/endpoints the primary end-point was clinical benefit rate (cbr) defined as the % of patients in the full analysis set with clinical benefit, where clinical benefit is defined as complete response (cr), partial response 
 (pr), or stable disease (sd) 
 ≥ 24 weeks, defined by modified recist. secondary endpoints included overall response rate (orr), time to progression (ttp), duration of 
 response (dor), duration of clinical benefit docb, and os. 
 pfs was in this study called ttp, but all events of death, irrespective of causality, were counted as 
 events. “ttp” according to the study definition, is therefore called pfs.</p><p> 
 sample size the clinical benefit rate for anastrozole in hormone receptor positive patients is estimated as 60% from previous studies of anastrozole in the current patient population. one-hundred randomised patients 
 per treatment group were required to give 80% power to rule out an absolute deficiency of 20% in 
 clinical benefit rate for fulvestrant 500 mg; 
 i.e., 2-sided 95% confidence interval to exclude a 20% deficiency.

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>the application for the new indication (endocrine naïve patients) is based on data from one pivotal study (falcon) and one supportive study (first). 
 the pivotal study falcon was a double blind study conducted in the target population for the 
 proposed new indication and the overall design is considered adequate. the chosen randomisation 
 stratification factors are considered to be important prognostic covariates. the statistical methods 
 described are endorsed. exclusion of the stratification factor “prior chemotherapy for locally advanced 
 or metastatic disease” was justified by very low patient numbers (including zero cell) in some of the 
 individual strata.</p><p>
 important protocol deviations were common, but mis-stratification did not result in imbalances of 
 importance. a sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the stratification factors recorded on the ecrf 
 rather than on the ivrs system and showed an hr for pfs consistent with the primary endpoint. no 
 information is available on the root cause of the errors in the stratification procedure which affected as 
 many as 85 subjects. nevertheless, these deviations are considered unlikely to affect the robustness of 
 the study.</p><p>
 with regards to baseline characteristics in study falcon, about 30% of patients had received no prior 
 endocrine therapy despite being diagnosed &gt;1 year prior to study enrolment which is unexpected. 
 otherwise, baseline characteristics essentially look as expected. there were some differences noted 
 with regards to baseline demographic and tumour characteristics. notably, a larger proportion of 
 patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm had visceral disease (58.7% vs. 51.3%). a 
 slightly larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy 
 compared with the anastrozole arm (15.2% and 11.6%, respectively). these small differences are not</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 39/59</p><p>
 meaningful and baseline and tumour characteristics are considered balanced between the two treatment arms. 
 although the median time from completion of final chemotherapy to randomisation was longer in the 
 fulvestrant arm (12.8 months; range: 1 to 283 months) than in the anastrozole arm (5.7 months; 
 range: 1 to 207 months), other summary statistics were broadly comparable. furthermore, a box and 
 whisker plot of time from completion of chemotherapy to randomisation showed no clear evidence that 
 the patients receiving chemotherapy on the fulvestrant 500 mg arm completed earlier than those on 
 the anastrozole 1 mg arm (data not shown). therefore these imbalances might be due to chance. 
 study first was an open label, anastrozole comparative exploratory study. the study was conducted 
 open-label with investigator assessed pfs complemented with independent review. her2 positive 
 patients could be enrolled (20%) and patients could have received (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy 
 (25%). approximately 27% of patients in the fulvestrant arm and 22% in the anastrozole arm had 
 received prior “endocrine therapy” which was completed at least 12 months prior to randomization, 
 i.e., were not “endocrine naïve” patients. nearly all of them had received tamoxifen (28 patients in 
 fulvestrant arm and 22 patients in anastrozole arm) and one subject in each arm had received prior 
 anastrozole.</p><p>
 this phase ii study is considered to provide reasonably strong supportive evidence to falcon for the 
 applied first line indication. at the time of the primary data cut-off, 36% of patients had progressed. a 
 follow-up analysis was performed when approximately 75% of patients had failed therapy to provide a 
 more complete assessment. the results of secondary analysis for ttp adjusted for baseline covariates 
 were consistent with the main unadjusted analysis of ttp. this suggested that the imbalance between 
 treatment groups in the proportion of patients with visceral disease at baseline in first did not impact 
 the efficacy findings.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>in study falcon, more progression events occurred in the anastrozole arm (166 patients [71.6%]) than in the fulvestrant arm (143 patients [62.2%], 2-sided p=0.0486). at an event rate of 60% to 
 70%, the pfs hr of 0.797 (95% ci 0.637 to 0.999) is likely to be stable. the median difference, 3 
 months, appears to reflect the hr and is considered non-trivial. fulvestrant was statistically borderline 
 superior to anastrozole.</p><p>
 a number of sensitivity analyses were undertaken, all showing borderline “positive/negative 
 significance”, the “worst” being p=0.06 (using stratification derived from crf), the “best” a cox 
 proportional hazard being p=0.03. the results of the sensitivity analyses support the primary pfs 
 result and its robustness. 
 overall, the results indicate a more favourable outcome with fulvestrant compared to anastrozole in 
 er+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated 
 with endocrine therapy, and support the currently applied indication. consistent results were observed 
 across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. many of the subgroups analysed were small in 
 size and consequently resulted in wide confidence intervals. however, in patients with visceral disease 
 at baseline, the benefit of fulvestrant over anastrozole was not evident, with median pfs 13.8 months 
 vs. 15.9 months (hr 0.993). the subgroup results have been reflected in section 5.1 of the smpc. 
 approximately 10% of the patients did not have complete data for the primary endpoint of pfs. a 
 greater proportion of patients were censored for progression at &gt;12 weeks before data cut-off in the 
 fulvestrant arm compared with the anastrozole arm (27 [11.7%] patients vs. 20 [8.6%] patients, 
 respectively). the mah performed a range of analyses to explore the sensitivity of results to the</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 40/59</p><p>
 standard non-informative censoring assumption underlying time to event analyses. baseline characteristics were compared between early and late censored patients and patients who had 
 progressed, and modelling was conducted to impute progression times which relax the non-informative 
 censoring assumption and assess the impact on treatment effect estimates. overall, it is considered 
 unlikely that the reasons for early censoring differ between the arms, resulting in a biased pfs result. 
 in terms of orr and cbr, rather similar results to anastrozole were observed between fulvestrant and 
 anastrozole. due to the similarity in orr, duration of response is considered informative (median dor 
 20 months and 13.2 months in the fulvestrant arm and anastrozole arm respectively). these 
 observations i.e. similar orr and difference in pfs are compatible with delayed resistance 
 development and is mechanistically plausible as fulvestrant has been reported to be less affected by 
 activating er mutations (fribbens et al 2016; spoerke et al 2016; toy et al 2016), but serum samples 
 were not collected on study for analyses of activating er mutations. os results are immature.</p><p> 
 regarding qol data, data after progression are sparse, reducing the possibility to detect symptomatic 
 differences related to progression, but in principle the curves mimic pfs curves. the hr for time to 
 deterioration favoured faslodex (0.84, p=0.16 not protected from multiplicity). overall, available 
 fact-b data do not indicate any differences in tolerability between fulvestrant and anastrozole.</p><p>
 results from the falcon study are supported by the results of study first which met its primary non-
 inferiority objective in terms of clinical benefit response (cbr). the primary efficacy results of clinical 
 benefit ratio (cbr) from the fas and pp populations supported the non-inferiority of fulvestrant 
 compared to anastrozole in treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive 
 advanced breast cancer. the results (cbr of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole 
 group) are considered supportive for the applied indication. after exclusion of patients that were 
 endocrine therapy naïve, the results remained stable and compatible with statistical borderline 
 superiority to anastrozole in terms of pfs and os. the results in the subgroup of first constructed in 
 order to reflect the target population in falcon were similar to the itt population, but more 
 favourable compared with falcon. 
 in the subgroup analysis of os, a tendency towards fulvestrant having greater benefit in patients 
 without visceral disease vs. those with visceral disease was observed, which is in line with observations 
 in the falcon study.</p><p>
 in support of the extension of the existing second line indication to ai-resistant patients (i.e. from 
 relapse or progression on anti-oestrogen therapy to relapse or progression on endocrine therapy), the 
 mah submitted a justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results 
 from the china confirm study, the final overall survival (os) analysis of the confirm study and 
 published literature, to supplement existing clinical data from confirm, finder1 and finder2 in 
 patients who have progressed following an ai. out of the trials, confirm, finder1 and finder2 have 
 been assessed previously in attempt to extend the current indication to ai-resistant patients in 2010. 
 in this type ii variation in 2010 (emea/h/c/540/ii/0018), based on the confirm study, the mah 
 sought for extension of the indication for disease relapse or disease progression on therapy with an 
 anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. at the time the chmp concluded that a favourable benefit – risk 
 balance had not been convincingly demonstrated for fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to 
 aromatase inhibitors. as part of the current application, the mah has not provided any new data in 
 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
 for disease relapse on or after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, or disease progression on therapy 
 with an aromatase inhibitor. neither the falcon nor the first studies include clinical data on these 
 patients. overall, the level of evidence available regarding the efficacy of fulvestrant in aromatase 
 inhibitor (ai)-resistant postmenopausal er+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients is 
 not considered sufficient to support and extension of the second line indication.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety of fulvestrant in clinical use has been investigated in clinical trials as well as in the post-marketing experience (344450 patient years of fulvestrant 250 mg/month and 211462 patient years of 
 fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure). the data submitted includes a further 281 + 77 patient years of 
 fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure. 
 the incidence of aes was not significantly different between the two treatment arms in both studies. in 
 the falcon study there were more patients with treatment related aes in the fulvestrant arm 
 compared to the anastrozole arm (39.9% [91/228] vs. 32.8% [76/232], respectively). in the first 
 study there were more patients reporting an ae of ctc grade 3 or higher in the fulvestrant arm 
 compared to the anastrozole arm (17.8% [18/101] vs. 10.7% [11/103], respectively). 
 in first study, bone pain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, and hypertension were more common in 
 patients receiving fulvestrant while there were more cases of hot flushes and myalgia in the 
 anastrozole group. 
 there were more cases of back pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity in patients receiving fulvestrant in 
 falcon while hypertension and anaemia were reported more frequently from patients taking 
 anastrozole. in first study hypertension was more common in the fulvestrant group and myalgia in 
 the anastrozole group. 
 whether there is an increase in arthralgia and related events or not related to fulvestrant was 
 discussed in the past. at the time partly conflicting data led to these events not being categorised as 
 adverse reaction. it is well known that anastrozole is associated with these events and the numerical 
 increase makes it clear that it should be reflected in the smpc also for fulvestrant. section 4.8 of the 
 smpc has been updated to include information about joint and musculoskeletal pain. 
 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more common in the fulvestrant group compared to 
 anastrozole group. the difference was driven mainly by rash, alopecia, dry skin, and erythema. 
 only single cases of death not caused by progression of breast cancer were reported for patients 
 receiving either fulvestrant or anastrozole. overall, mortality rate was lower in the fulvestrant group 
 compared to anastrozole group (29.4% vs. 32.3% at the dlp of falcon). 
 serious adverse events involving patients in the fulvestrant group are known from earlier clinical use 
 and not unexpected. 
 haematological abnormalities as well as hepatic enzyme and bilirubin elevations were reported at 
 similar rates from both treatment arms in falcon. anaemia was more common in patients taking 
 anastrozole. no changes to the smpc are required with regards to the laboratory parameter 
 abnormalities. 
 more patients discontinued fulvestrant. nevertheless discontinuation rates were observed at an 
 acceptable level.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 cases of overdose reported in patients taking faslodex was identified as a subject for review while analysing falcon data (one case of overdose was reported, not associated with any other aes). 
 astrazeneca global database retrieved 48 cases of overdose in which majority of events were 
 inconsistent with the signal being evaluated, had limited information and had no adverse event 
 associated with it. section 4.9 of the smpc has been updated to reflect that there are isolated reports 
 of overdose with faslodex in humans. if overdose occurs, symptomatic supportive treatment is 
 recommended. 
 the rmp is considered adequate and no new safety concerns were included. however missing 
 information “use during pregnancy and lactation” and “use in women of childbearing potential” were 
 merged into “reprotoxicity (fertility, pregnancy and lactation)” and upgraded to important potential 
 risk based on available data.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.2">2.5.2.  
 conclusions on clinical safety</header><p>the overall safety has remained unchanged and there were no new safety signals raised from the two studies presented. joint and musculoskeletal pain are relatively well known adverse drug reactions of 
 anti-oestrogen therapy and the smpc has been updated to reflect these. the frequency category of 
 several adverse drug reactions has also been updated in line with the incidence reported in the pooled

 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>current treatment guidelines emphasise the preferential use of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hr+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for 
 cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (cardoso et al 2014).</p><p>
 the choice of first-line endocrine therapy for hr+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and 
 length of therapy received in the adjuvant setting (if any). the endocrine therapy options include, but 
 are not limited to, selective estrogen receptor modulators (serm; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor 
 antagonists (e.g. fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (nsai; e.g. anastrozole and 
 letrozole) and steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane) (esmo guideline; nccn breast cancer, 
 version 2.2017). these agents may be given in first, second or later lines of therapy for advanced 
 breast cancer (esmo guideline; nccn clinical practice guidelines in oncology). fulvestrant is currently 
 authorised for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
 cancer in postmenopausal women with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or 
 disease progression on antiestrogen therapy. combination therapies with other agents are also 
 therapeutic options such as exemestane with everolimus, palbociclib with fulvestrant/an aromatase 
 inhibitor (nccn, breast cancer, version 2.2017).</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.  
 main clinical studies</header><p>the application for the new indication in endocrine naïve patients is based on data from two studies: • a supportive phase 2 study (study d6995c00006): open-label study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 205 women with advanced disease previously untreated with 
 endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (first)</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/490887/2017</p><p>
 page 56/59 
 • a pivotal phase 3 study (study d699bc00001): randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously been treated with any 
 hormonal therapy (falcon)</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.  
 favourable effects</header><p>study falcon (n=230 + 232) showed borderline significant superiority in terms of pfs (hr 0.797, p=0.0486, sensitivity analyses 0.03 – 0.06, medians 16.6 months vs. 13.8 months). the odds ratio for 
 orr is close to 1 which indicated similarity between the treatments. os data are immature at event 
 rates of about 30% (hr 0.875). median dor was longer in the fulvestrant arm (20.0 months) 
 compared with the anastrozole arm (13.2 months). the overall data are compatible with a possible 
 delay in the development of resistance of response compared with anastrozole. 
 the first study (n=102 + 103) met its primary non-inferiority objective in terms of clinical benefit 
 response (cbr): cbr of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole group; odds ratio 1.302</p><p>
 (0.717, 2.380), p-value: 0.386. this was supported by the secondary endpoints pfs (hr 0.7, p=0.01) 
 and os (hr 0.7, p=0.04, medians 54 vs. 48 m.). orr similar and data are again compatible with 
 delayed development of secondary resistance compared with anastrozole.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>in the falcon study, the superiority of faslodex over ai seemed to be lost in the subgroup of patients with er+ breast cancer with visceral metastases (pfs hr 0.99). no satisfactory explanation has been 
 identified and the results in these subgroups have been reflected in section 5.1 of the smpc. 
 the objectives of falcon did not include cross-over and pfs2 data were not collected. thus the 
 possible importance of the sequence of therapy cannot be assessed.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>fulvestrant has been approved for 12 years and the safety is considered reasonably well described. no new adrs were observed in the clinical studies submitted with the application. the most common 
 adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, hot flushes, nausea, elevated hepatic enzymes, 
 rash, joint and musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and injection site reactions. in falcon, the expected 
 increase in joint and musculoskeletal pain was confirmed and the smpc has been updated accordingly.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.
