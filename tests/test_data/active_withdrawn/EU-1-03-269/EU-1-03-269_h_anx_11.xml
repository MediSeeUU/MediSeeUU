 4.1
 therapeutic indications</header><p>faslodex is indicated for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women:
  not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>posologyadult females (including elderly)the recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given two weeks after the initial dose.
 special populations
 renal impairmentno dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 30 ml/min). safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these 
 patients (see section 4.4).
 hepatic impairmentno dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).
 paediatric populationthe safety and efficacy of faslodex in children from birth to 18 years of age have not beenestablished. currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
 posology can be made.
 method of administration
 faslodex should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular injection 
 (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock (gluteal area).
 3caution should be taken if injecting faslodex at the dorsogluteal site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve.
 for detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header>4.3contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).
 severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>faslodex should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).
 faslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 less than 30 ml/min). 
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, faslodex should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical studies with faslodex (see section 4.8). this should be taken into 
 consideration when prescribing faslodex to patients at risk.
 injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy 
 have been reported with faslodex injection. caution should be taken while administering faslodex at 
 the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve (see sections 4.2 and 
 4.8).
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. due to the mechanism of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.
 interference with estradiol antibody assaysdue to the structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant may interfere with antibodybased-estradiol assays and may result in falsely increased levels of estradiol.
 paediatric population
 faslodex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not been 
 established in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of cyp3a4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp3a4. clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp3a4) and 
 ketoconazole (inhibitor of cyp3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. 
 dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and cyp3a4 
 inhibitors or inducers concomitantly.</p></section><section><header>4.6fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potentialpatients of child-bearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception while on treatment.
 4pregnancyfaslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). fulvestrant has been shown to cross the 
 placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. studies in animals have shown reproductive 
 toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). if 
 pregnancy occurs while taking faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.
 breast-feeding
 breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with faslodex. fulvestrant is excreted in milk in 
 lactating rats. it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. considering the potential 
 for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is 
 contraindicated (see section 4.3).
 fertility
 the effects of faslodex on fertility in humans has not been studied.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>faslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. however, since asthenia has been reported very commonly with faslodex, caution should be observed by those 
 patients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>this section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical studies, post-marketing studies or spontaneous reports. the most frequently reported adverse reactions are injection site 
 reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic enzymes (alt, ast, alp).
 the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (adrs) were calculated based on the 
 faslodex 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared faslodex 500 mg 
 with faslodex 250 mg [confirm (study d6997c00002), finder 1 (study d6997c00004), 
 finder 2 (study d6997c00006), and newest (study d6997c00003) studies], or from falcon 
 (study d699bc00001) alone that compared faslodex 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg. where 
 frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and falcon, the highest frequency is 
 presented. the frequencies in the following table were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, 
 regardless of the investigator assessment of causality.
 adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (soc). 
 frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), 
 common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100). within each frequency grouping 
 adverse reactions are reported in order of decreasing seriousness.</p></section><section><header>table 1adverse drug reactions</header></section><section><header>adverse reactions by system organ class and frequency</header><p>infections and infestationscommon

 least one (1) dose of fulvestrant and 232 patients who received at least one (1) dose of anastrozole, 
 respectively in the phase 3 falcon study.
 joint and musculoskeletal painin the falcon study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and musculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, 
 respectively. of the 65 patients in the faslodex arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and 
 musculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the first 
 3 months of treatment. no patients reported events that were ctcae grade ≥3 or that required a dose 
 reduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions.
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in

 .</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>there are isolated reports of overdose with faslodex in humans. if overdose occurs, symptomatic supportive treatment is recommended. animal studies suggest that no effects other than those related 
 directly or indirectly to antiestrogenic activity were evident with higher doses of fulvestrant (see 
 section 5.3).</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1 
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>6pharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, antiestrogens, atc code: l02ba03 mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects
 fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
 fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
 the mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. 
 clinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
 significantly downregulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was also 
 a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen 
 agonist effects. it has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates er and the proliferation 
 marker ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal 
 neoadjuvant setting.
 clinical efficacy and safety in advanced breast cancer
 a phase 3 clinical study was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer 
 who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine 
 therapy for advanced disease. the study included 423 patients whose disease had recurred or 
 progressed during antiestrogen therapy (ae subgroup) and 313 patients whose disease had recurred or 
 progressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (ai subgroup). this study compared the efficacy and 
 safety of faslodex 500 mg (n=362) with faslodex 250 mg (n=374). progression-free survival (pfs)
 was the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (orr), 
 clinical benefit rate (cbr) and overall survival (os). efficacy results for the confirm study are 
 summarized in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2summary of results of the primary efficacy endpoint (pfs) and key secondary

 a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study of faslodex 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg was conducted in postmenopausal women with er-positive and/or pgr-positive 
 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had not previously been treated with any hormonal 
 therapy. a total of 462 patients were randomised 1:1 sequentially to receive either fulvestrant 500 mg 
 or anastrozole 1 mg.
 randomisation was stratified by disease setting (locally advanced or metastatic), prior chemotherapy 
 for advanced disease, and measurable disease.
 the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was investigator assessed progression-free survival (pfs) 
 evaluated according to recist 1.1 (response evaluation criteria in solid tumours). key secondary 
 efficacy endpoints included overall survival (os) and objective response rate (orr).
 patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90). the majority of patients 
 (87.0%) had metastatic disease at baseline. fifty-five percent (55.0%) of patients had visceral 
 metastasis at baseline. a total of 17.1% of patients received a prior chemotherapy regimen for 
 advanced disease; 84.2% of patients had measurable disease.
 consistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. for the 
 subgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral metastasis (n=208), the hr was 0.592 (95% 
 ci: 0.419, 0.837) for the faslodex arm compared to the anastrozole arm. for the subgroup of patients 
 with visceral metastasis (n=254), the hr was 0.993 (95% ci: 0.740, 1.331) for the faslodex arm 
 compared to the anastrozole arm. the efficacy results of the falcon study are presented in table 3

 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. seventy seven percent (77%) of the study 
 population had estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. these studies compared the safety and 
 efficacy of monthly administration of faslodex 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg 
 anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). overall, faslodex at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as 
 effective as anastrozole in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and time to death. 
 there were no statistically significant differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment 
 groups. progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. combined analysis of both studies
 showed that 83% of patients who received faslodex progressed, compared with 85% of patients who 
 received anastrozole. combined analysis of both studies showed the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg 
 to anastrozole for progression-free survival was 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10). the objective response 
 rate for faslodex 250 mg was 19.2% compared with 16.5% for anastrozole. the median time to death 
 was 27.4 months for patients treated with faslodex and 27.6 months for patients treated with 
 anastrozole. the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci

 9effects on the postmenopausal endometriumpreclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium (see section 5.3). a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day 
 ethinylestradiol showed that pretreatment with faslodex 250 mg resulted in significantly reduced 
 stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged 
 by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness.
 neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either faslodex 
 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial thickness, 
 indicating a lack of agonist effect. there is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the breast 
 cancer patients studied. no data are available regarding endometrial morphology.
 in two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
 disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measurement 
 between fulvestrant and placebo groups.
 effects on bonethere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either faslodex 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in 
 clinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers.
 paediatric population
 faslodex is not indicated for use in children. the european medicines agency has waived the 
 obligation to submit the results of studies with faslodex in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
 breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
 an open-label phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant in 
 30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with progressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright 
 syndrome (mas). the paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant. 
 this 12-month study investigated a range of mas endpoints and showed a reduction in the frequency 
 of vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. the steady-state trough 
 concentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that in adults (see 
 section 5.2). there were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-year data are yet 
 not available.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption after administration of faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed 
 and maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) are reached after about 5 days. administration of faslodex 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month 
 of dosing (mean [cv]: auc 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, c
 max 25.1 [35.3%] ng/ml, cmin16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained within a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and 
 trough concentrations. after intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately 
 dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg.
 distribution
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. the large apparent volume of distribution at 
 steady state (vd
 ss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. very low density lipoprotein (vldl), low 
 density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are the major binding 
 components. no interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. the role of sex 
 hormone-binding globulin (shbg) has not been determined.
 biotransformation
 10the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. identified metabolites 
 (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or 
 exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in antiestrogen models. studies using human liver preparations 
 and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme involved in the 
 oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo. in vitrodata suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes.elimination
 fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. the major route of excretion is via the faeces, 
 with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) after intramuscular administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.
 special populations
 in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase 3 studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s 
 pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.
 renal impairmentmild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.
 hepatic impairmentthe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical study conducted in women with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b). a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold increase 
 in auc in women with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. in patients administered 
 faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated. women with 
 severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) were not evaluated.
 paediatric populationthe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 30 girls with progressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright syndrome (see section 5.1). the 
 paediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of 
 fulvestrant. the geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (c
 min,ss) and auc
 ss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/ml and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/ml, respectively. although the data collected were limited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to be consistent with 
 those in adults.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies. local reactions, including myositis and granulomata at the injection site were attributed 
 to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to the saline 
 control. in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, the 
 antiestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in the 
 female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes. arteritis 
 involving a range of different tissues was seen in some dogs after chronic (12 months) dosing.
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen. these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt;15 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.
 11fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential.fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
 antiestrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats, a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed. rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in 
 placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence of 
 foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae).
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males. in a two-year mouse 
 oncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of ovarian sex cord 
 stromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. at the no-effect 
 level for these findings, systemic exposure levels (auc) were, in rats, approximately 1.5–fold the 
 expected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-fold 
 the expected human exposure levels in both males and females. induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by 
 antiestrogens in cycling animals. therefore these findings are not considered to be relevant to the use 
 of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars
