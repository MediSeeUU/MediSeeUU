 biologic features and clinical presentation</header><p>breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having varied responses to anti-hormonal and chemotherapy treatments. breast tumour types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, 
 with one third of tumours being er-negative and two thirds of tumours being er-positive. berry, et al</p><p>
 have shown in a meta-analysis of node-positive patients in the adjuvant setting that while patients with 
 er-positive tumours who receive adjuvant hormonal therapy have better disease-free and overall survival 
 than their counterparts with er-negative tumours, advances in chemotherapy in the er-negative setting 
 have lessened the survival differences between these 2 groups. in this way, er status is a strong 
 predictive factor in identifying patients who may benefit from endocrine therapy. 
 er-positive tumours make up 65% of tumours in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumours in 
 women older than 65 years. these cancers are largely estrogen driven in postmenopausal women where 
 the main source of the tumour’s estrogen is from conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase 
 enzyme action.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.1">2.1.1.

 choice between endocrine therapies for the initial treatment is often driven by prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, potential side effects, time to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal 
 status. 
 currently, first-line treatment in the er-positive, her2-negative advanced breast cancer postmenopausal 
 population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, 
 and tamoxifen

 progressive disease and limited tumour-related symptoms
 8. presently, second and subsequent lines of therapy in the hormone receptor-positive advanced breast 
 cancer population typically include endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, steroidal or 
 nonsteroidal ais, progestins, and androgens

 have progressed after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole may also receive everolimus (afinitor) in

 faslodex was originally approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor 
 positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-
 estrogen therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. 
 the indication was extended on 25 july 2017 to the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally 
 advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine 
 therapy. 
 it is currently approved in the european union (eu) as 250 mg/5 ml solution for injection in the following 
 indication: 
 faslodex is indicated for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
 • not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or • with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy.</p><p> 5 national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) breast cancer version 2.2015. 6 bergh j, jonsson pe, lidbrink ek, et al.</p><p>fact: an open-label randomized phase iii study of fulvestrant and anastrozole in combination compared with anastrozole alone as first-line therapy for patients with receptor-positive

 fulvestrant was originally approved at a dose of 250 mg for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hr+ advanced breast cancer whose disease recurred or progressed on previous antioestrogen 
 therapy. the 250 mg dose was subsequently replaced by fulvestrant 500 mg, which was approved in the 
 eu in march 2010 (procedural number emea/h/c/000540/ii/0018). approval for the 500 mg dose was 
 based primarily on the phase 3 confirm study (d6997c00002), a randomised, double-blind study that 
 compared the fulvestrant 500 mg and 250 mg dose regimens in postmenopausal women with hr+ 
 advanced breast cancer who had either relapsed while on adjuvant endocrine therapy, or progressed 
 while on first-line endocrine therapy for advanced disease.</p><p>
 on 09 november 2016 the european commission granted market authorisation to a new chemical entity, 
 ibrance (palbociclib) for use in combination with fulvestrant. palbociclib is an oral, first in class, small 
 molecule drug. it is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cdk 4 and 6, and was authorised by the european 
 commission on 09 november 2016 for the following indication: 
 ibrance is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
 - in combination with an aromatase inhibitor; 
 - in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
 in pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing hormone-
 releasing hormone (lhrh) agonist. 
 the approval for the combination of palbociclib with fulvestrant was primarily based on the phase 3 study paloma-3.</p><p>
 the purpose of the current application is to extend the indication of fulvestrant to include the use in 
 combination with ibrance. the applied indication was: 
 “
 faslodex is indicated in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic 
 breast cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1).</p><p>
 in pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined with a 
 luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) agonist.
 ” the recommended indication is: 
 “faslodex is indicated: 
 • as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women:</p><p>
 o not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or o with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy. 
 • in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
 in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1). 
 in pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined with a

 recent tumour biopsy (unless bone-only disease, see below) utilizing an assay consistent with local 
 standards. 
 4. documented her2-negative tumour based on local testing on most recent tumour biopsy: 
 her2-negative tumour was determined as immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ 
 hybridization (fish [fluorescent in situ hybridization]/cish [chromogenic in situ hybridization]/sish 
 [silver fluorescent in situ hybridization]/dish [dual fluorescent in situ hybridization]) defined as a human 
 epidermal growth factor receptor 2/centromeric probe for chromosome 17 (her2/cep17) ratio &lt;2 or for 
 single probe assessment a her2 copy number &lt;4. 
 5. patients were to satisfy the following criteria for prior therapy:

 6. except where prohibited by local regulations, all patients were to agree to provide and had available a 
 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (ffpe) tissue biopsy sample taken at the time of presentation with 
 recurrent or metastatic disease. a de novo biopsy was required if no archived tissue taken at the time of 
 presentation with recurrent/metastatic disease was available. the sole exceptions were those patients 
 with bone-only disease for whom provision of previous archival tissue only was acceptable. patients who 
 had surgery within the last 3 years (but without neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery) and 
 relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy may provide a tumour specimen from that surgery.

 to demonstrate the superiority of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) 
 over fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) plus placebo in prolonging investigator-assessed progression-

 tumour assessments 
 post-baseline tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) for the first year, then after 
 1 year every 12 weeks (±7 days) (calculated from randomization) until radiographically and/or clinically 
 (i.e., for photographed or palpable lesions) documented pd as per recist v.1.1, study treatment 
 discontinuation, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study 
 participation (e.g., death, patient&apos;s request, lost to follow-up)</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>the sample size for this study was determined based on the results of a randomized phase 2 trial assessing fulvestrant with or without dasatinib in postmenopausal patients with hr positive metastatic 
 breast cancer previously treated with an ai. the median pfs for the fulvestrant alone arm was 5.3 
 months and the median pfs for the combination arm was 6.0 months. based upon these results, the 
 median pfs for the comparator arm in this study was assumed to be 6.0 months.</p><p>ema/53381/2018 
 page 18/54 
 an improvement of 56% to a median pfs of 9.38 months (corresponding to a hr=0.64) was to be considered clinically meaningful. a total of 238 pfs events were required in the two treatment arms for 
 the study to have a 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 (representing a 56% improvement in 
 median pfs [6.00 months vs 9.38 months]) with a 1-sided significance level of alpha=0.025. 
 assuming a non-uniform accrual accomplished over a period of about 14 months, data follow-up for 
 approximately 20 months from the start of study randomization for final pfs analysis, and a non-uniform 
 dropout with dropout rate of 25% at 18 months for pfs, a total sample size of approximately 417 
 patients (278 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and 139 in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm) was 
 required. 
 the sample size described above also allowed the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of 
 os. the median os for women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with ai and fulvestrant 
 monotherapy was assumed to be 24 months. with an overall one-sided α of 0.025 and one interim 
 analysis of os, the study had approximately 80% power to detect a hr of 0.65 (representing a 54% 
 increase in median os from 24 months to37 months) when 198 deaths had occurred.</p><p>
 a sample-size re-estimation was allowed by protocol at the interim analysis (see below), using the 
 inferential procedure described by cui et al (1999)
 9 to preserve the type i error.</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>randomisation was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes versus no), by menopausal status at study entry (pre-/peri- versus postmenopausal), and by the presence of visceral 
 metastases (yes versus no). ‘visceral’ referred to lung, liver, brain, pleural and peritoneal involvement. 
 sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either: documented clinical benefit (cr, pr, sd ≥24 
 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting, or at least 24 months of adjuvant 
 hormonal therapy prior to recurrence.</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>this was a double-blind trial.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>pfs data were censored on the date of the last tumour assessment on study for patients who did not have objective tumour progression and who did not die while on study. patients lacking an evaluation of 
 tumour response after randomization had their pfs time censored on the date of randomization with the 
 duration of one day. additionally, patients who started a new anticancer therapy prior to documented pd 
 were censored at the date of the last tumour assessment prior to the start of the new therapy. patients 
 with documentation of pd or death after an unacceptably long interval (ie, 2 or more incomplete or non-
 evaluable assessments) since the last tumour assessment were censored at the time of last objective 
 assessment that did not show pd. 
 time-to-event endpoints between the 2 treatment arms were compared with a 1-sided stratified log-rank 
 test adjusting for presence of visceral metastases and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (two of the 
 baseline stratification factors). pfs time associated with each treatment arm were summarized for the itt 
 population using the kaplan-meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate. hazard ratios 
 and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (subject to the multiplicity adjustment at the final analysis for pfs 
 and os) were estimated using cox proportional hazards regression.</p><p>

 page 19/54 
 cox proportional hazard models were also used to explore the potential influences of the baseline stratification factors on time-to-event endpoints. 
 the study was designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis at 238 events based on the 
 primary pfs endpoint with the investigator assessment. the interim analysis was to be conducted to 
 allow for early stopping of the study due to efficacy or to potentially re-estimate the sample size of the 
 trial based upon the primary endpoint of pfs. the safety of the combination was also assessed at the 
 interim analysis. the haybittle-peto boundary was used (alpha=0.00135 was to be spent at interim 
 analysis) in developing the efficacy boundary of the interim analysis of pfs. the analysis was to be 
 performed after approximately 143 investigator-assessed pfs events (documented progressive disease or 
 death; approximately 60% of the total events expected). the information fraction for the interim analysis 
 may be adjusted if needed. 
 only one interim analysis of os is planned. although the first possible time for os interim analysis could 
 be at the time of the pfs ia, it is anticipated that the number of deaths could be low at pfs ia and yield 
 non-robust analysis results. therefore, the os interim analysis will be planned at approximately 97 
 deaths (at the estimated time for planned pfs final analysis). for the interim analysis of os, o’brien-
 fleming boundary will be used and the overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of os will be 
 preserved at 0.025 (one-sided test).</p></section><section><header>results participant flow

 the study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed pfs at the interim analysis 
 conducted on 82% of the planned pfs events; the results crossed the pre-specified haybittle-peto

 sensitivity analysis 1: influence of analysis population; based on at population</p><p>ema/53381/2018 
 page 28/54 
 sensitivity analysis 2: a 1-sided unstratified log-rank test was used to compare treatments and the hr was based on an unstratified 
 cox proportional hazards model. 
 sensitivity analysis 3: to investigate whether the stratification factors and important covariates influenced the outcome of the primary 
 endpoint pfs. final explanatory variables for the multivariate model were selected using a backward selection process with the 
 significance level of 0.1 for retaining the effects in the model. baseline factors that entered the model selection included age (≥65 vs 
 &lt;65), race (white, black, asian, other), baseline ecog status (1 vs 0), disease site (non-visceral vs visceral), sensitivity to prior 
 hormonal therapy (yes vs no), menopausal status at study entry (pre/peri vs post), ethnic origin (hispanic vs not-hispanic), and 
 geographical region (north america, europe, asia pacific). 
 assessor’s note: baseline ecog status (1 vs. 0), and disease site (non-visceral vs. visceral) met the criteria and were the two baseline factors included in the model to yield the hr 0.395. 
 sensitivity analysis 4: influence of disease assessment scheduling. if disease progression was documented between 2 scheduled tumour 
 assessments, then the date of progression was assigned to the earlier scheduled tumour assessment. in the event of death, the date of 
 the endpoint was not adjusted. 
 sensitivity analysis 5: influence of deviations in tumour lesion assessment. if a lesion was classified as “indeterminate” (ind) at time 
 point “x” and was adequately evaluated as pd at the next time point “x+1”, then pd was assigned to the time point “x” or earlier (the 
 first date of the consecutive inds) instead of the date of the next time point “x+1” as the primary analysis. 
 sensitivity analysis 6.1: influence of bone-only disease patients. patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, 
 surgery, ecog at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were censored at the date of prior tumour assessment with 
 no pd. 
 sensitivity analysis 6.2: influence of bone-only disease patients: patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, 
 surgery, ecog at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were considered as events. 
 sensitivity analysis 6.3: influence of bone-only disease patients: bone-only disease patients were excluded from the analysis. 
 sensitivity analysis 7: influence of missing data: the following missing pfs data that might have resulted in the censored pfs data in 
 the primary analysis were considered pfs events in addition to the documented pd and death: new anti-cancer treatment, lost to 
 follow-up, consent withdrawal, medication error without associated ae. 
 sensitivity analysis 8: influence of potential investigator bias. random sample bicr data and investigator assessed pfs (event) data 
 were combined. for events identified by both bicr and investigator, bicr data were used to determine event time. for patients who 
 were censored by both bicr and investigator, bicr (when applicable) data were used to determine the censoring time. 
 1) for sensitivity analyses 1 and 4 to 8, stratified hazard ratios are presented, for sensitivity analyses 2 and 3 unstratified hazard ratio 
 ratios.

 patient-reported outcomes the pro evaluable population was defined as a subset of itt patients, who had completed a baseline and 
 at least one post–baseline pro assessment prior to end of study treatment. no update was provided for 
 pros.</p><p>
 patient–reported outcomes were investigated using the instruments, eortc qlq-c30, qlqc30 and eq-
 5d. these are considered standard. however, no primary objective and no strategy to protect the type-1 
 error rational are put forward in the study protocol or sap. furthermore, the results indicated emotional 
 functioning as a driver for the overall health related qol, why the plausibility of results may also be 
 questioned. unblinding due to the effects of palbociclib on the bone marrow may clearly be present and 
 the results potentially associated with hopes with regard to the benefit of the experimental compound. 
 the claims concerning global health status/qol were therefore not accepted. 
 time to deterioration in pain a total of 335 patients in the faslodex plus palbociclib arm and 166 patients in the faslodex plus placebo arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline visit. 
 a time to event analysis was prespecified for pain. time-to-deterioration was pre-specified as time 
 between baseline and first occurrence of 
 ≥ 10 points increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. this is an established cut-off in qlq-c30.</p><p>
 addition of palbociclib to faslodex resulted in a symptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-
 deterioration in pain symptom compared with faslodex plus placebo (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 
 months; hr of 0.64 [95% ci: 0.49, 0.85]; p&lt;0.001).</p></section><section><header>table 15. qlq-c30 time to deterioration - symptom scale of pain increase of ≥10 points (study 1023, pro analysis population)</header><p> ema/53381/2018

 discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>study 1023 was a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study comparing palbociclib vs. placebo as add-on to fulvestrant (+ goserelin in pre- and perimenopausal patients) in patients with 
 hormone receptor (hr) positive, her2-negative metastatic breast cancer, whose disease had progressed 
 after prior endocrine therapy. cross-over was not allowed.</p><p>
 the treatment arms were well balanced with regard to the stratification factors. neither the 
 inclusion/exclusion criteria violations nor the changes to the protocol and sap appeared to have put the 
 integrity of the study at risk. there were no objections to the overall study design. the baseline disease 
 characteristics were similar across study arms. small imbalances were noted but were not considered 
 likely to affect the overall study results. 
 the study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed pfs at the interim analysis (data 
 cut-off 05 dec 2014), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in pfs and a clinical 
 meaningful treatment effect. a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the 
 primary analysis.</p><p>
 overall survival data were immature and thus non-informative with in total 28 deaths and event rates of 
 5% in both arms at the interim analysis. therefore, two updated analyses were performed for 
 investigator-based pfs, orr, cbr and dor at a median of 8.9 months follow-up (data cut-off 16 march 
 2015) and over 15 months (data cut-off 23 october 2015), respectively. in the second update, performed 
 at an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 76%), the pfs hr was 0.50 (0.36-0.59). median pfs was 11.2 
 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a difference of 6.6 months. thus in the updated analysis, the difference between 
 arms has increased from 5.7 to 6.6 months. 
 in updated pfs subgroup analyses, all subgroup hr point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% 
 confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results.</p><p>
 in the updated analysis the difference in objective response rate (orr), 21 vs 8.6% (non-overlapping 
 confidence intervals, 1-sided p= 0.0001), and clinical benefit rate (cbr), 66.3 vs 39.7% (non-
 overlapping confidence intervals, 1-sided p&lt;0.0001), supports the pfs results. duration of response 
 (dor) was numerically but not statistically significantly longer in the experimental arm compared with 
 the comparator arm, 10.4 vs. 9.0 months. 
 at a pre-specified interim os analysis (data cut-off date of 23 oct 2015) there were in total 112 deaths 
 (21%) in both arms; 20.5 vs. 23.6% (experimental vs. control). no deaths in the palbociclib in 
 combination with fulvestrant arm were due to toxicity. the formal statistical analysis of os will be 
 performed during the planned os interim analysis and final analysis. at this time, there are no signs of a 
 detrimental effect on os. the final analysis of overall survival is projected to occur by q4 (dec) 2017. 
 the mah of ibrance (palbociclib) has committed to submit these results by q2 (june) 2018 (see epar 
 ibrance). 
 with regard to patient-reported outcomes (pros), a time to event analysis was pre-specified for time to 
 deterioration (ttd), defined as first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in the symptom of pain 
 on study. statistically convincing and plausible results were achieved with a difference in median time to 
 deterioration of 8.0 vs 2.8 months, hr 0.6, p &lt;0.001.</p><p>
 critical visceral disease 
 according to current international treatment guidelines, endocrine therapy is not recommended in 
 patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, due to a lower expectancy of a 
 rapid tumour response or relevant tumour shrinkage compared with (cytotoxic) chemotherapies. this 
 patient population was also excluded from study paloma-3.</p><p>ema/53381/2018 
 page 39/54 
 in patients with visceral disease in paloma-3, the orr was improved by 21.7% (from 13.3 to 35%) and time to response (ttr) was improved by 1.6 months (from 5.4 to 3.8 months) (see section 5.1 of 
 smpc).</p><p>
 with regard to critical visceral disease, a rapid response to therapy is of importance. there is little 
 published data on ttr for comparison. from the very limited literature identified, mainly phase 2 studies 
 in different lines of therapy in the metastatic setting, the data showed that the ttr of 3.8 months 
 observed for palbociclib + fulvestrant as second line treatment, is more similar to the ttr of endocrine 
 therapies (around 4 months) than of the chemotherapy combinations reported (around 2 months).</p><p>
 due to the limited information publicly available, and the many confounding factors such as line of 
 therapy affecting cross-study comparisons, no firm conclusions can be drawn with regard to the time to 
 response of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant relative to conventional chemotherapies. as the 
 efficacy in general, as well as ttr, is clearly better for the palbociclib + fulvestrant combination compared 
 with the endocrine therapy alone, no restriction of indication is considered appropriate. information has 
 been introduced in the smpc to inform the prescriber of the orr and ttr results for the visceral 
 subgroups (see smpc section 5.1). section 4.4 of the smpc has been updated to reflect that the efficacy 
 and safety of faslodex (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) have not been studied 
 in patients with critical visceral disease (see smpc section 4.4).</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.

 months improvement in median progression-free survival (hr: 0.50). while the data are still considered

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>at the latest safety data cut-off date of 31 july 2015, a higher proportion of aes overall (99 % vs. 91 %), grade 3/4 (76 % vs. 23 %), aes that led to temporary discontinuation and dose reductions (37 % vs. 2 
 %) were reported for the palbociclib + fulvestrant (experimental/combination) arm compared to the 
 placebo + fulvestrant (control) arm.</p><p>
 there was a high proportion of temporary discontinuations from study treatment in the combination arm 
 69 % vs 13 % in the control arm. however, few patients (approximately 5%) permanently discontinued 
 the study or permanently discontinued palbociclib/ placebo or fulvestrant due to aes. from a tolerability 
 perspective this is reassuring. the main causes leading to temporary discontinuations were haematology 
 related.</p><p>
 the add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in events 
 of myelosuppression, largely neutropenia (mainly grade 3), which has led to a high proportion of patients 
 undergoing temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions in the experimental arm. it is 
 notable however, that overall few cases of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection 
 have been reported. considering the fairly low proportion of permanent vs. the high proportion of 
 temporary discontinuations, it appears that neutropenia is in most cases successfully managed with 
 measures like dose reductions and dose interruptions. references to the summary of product 
 characteristics of palbociclib have been included in faslodex smpc sections 4.2 and 4.4. furthermore, 
 section 4.8 of the smpc has been updated to reflect relevant safety data from paloma-3, including more 
 detailed information on haematological adrs. 
 in study 1023, there was no notable difference in the incidence of saes between palbociclib in 
 combination with fulvestrant treated subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to those &lt;65 years of age. in 
 regard to treatment duration by age-groups (median), no apparent difference between age group &lt; 65 
 and ≥65-74 is noted. the number of patients ≥ 75 years of age were limited which preclude any firm 
 conclusion to be drawn in this age group. no specific measures in the smpc or rmp are proposed. this is 
 considered acceptable.

 conclusions on clinical safety</header><p>the add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in toxicity relative fulvestrant alone. the main underlying cause behind this is the palbociclib associated 
 myelosuppression, essentially neutropenia, which however does not appear to be translated into a 
 corresponding high proportion of febrile neutropenia. the magnitude and severities of the teaes reported 
 did not result into a high proportion of permanent discontinuations or non-disease related deaths. hence,</p><p>ema/53381/2018

 disease or condition</header><p>breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having varied responses to anti-hormonal and chemotherapy treatments. breast tumour types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, 
 with one third of tumours being er-negative and two thirds of tumours being er-positive.</p><p> 
 er-positive tumours make up 65% of tumours in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumours in 
 women older than 65 years. these cancers are largely oestrogen driven in postmenopausal women where 
 the main source of the tumour’s oestrogen is from conversion of androgens to oestrogens via aromatase 
 enzyme action. modification of oestrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for 
 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, particularly for those

 first-line treatment option for hormone receptor-positive, her2-negative advanced breast cancer (except for immediately life-threatening disease or when concerns exist regarding endocrine resistance). the 
 choice between endocrine therapies for the initial treatment is often driven by prior adjuvant endocrine 
 therapy, potential side effects, time to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal 
 status. 
 currently, first-line treatment in the er-positive, her2-negative advanced breast cancer postmenopausal 
 population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, 
 and tamoxifen with time to progression and prolongation of pfs ranging from 5 to 15 months.</p><p>second 
 and subsequent lines of therapy in the hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer population 
 typically include endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, steroidal or nonsteroidal ais, 
 progestins, and androgens.</p><p>
 palbociclib has also recently been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (hr) positive, her2 
 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine backbone therapy 
 (aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant).</p><p>
 in addition, postmenopausal women with hr-positive, her2-negative breast cancer that have progressed

 main clinical studies</header><p>study 1023 (paloma-3) was a 2:1 randomised (n=521), double-blind phase 3 trial comparing palbociclib + fulvestrant vs. placebo + fulvestrant in patients with hr- positive and her2 negative breast cancer who 
 had progressed on at least one prior endocrine therapy in any disease setting. peri-and premenopausal 
 patients were also required to receive a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) agonist such as 
 goserelin to suppress ovarian function.</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.  
 favourable effects</header><p>an interim analysis was performed at a median of 5.6 months follow-up and an overall event rate of 37% (100/347 and 93/174 in experimental and comparator arm, respectively). at this point, the study met its 
 primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed pfs with hazard ratio (hr) 0.42 (95% ci: 0.32, 
 0.56; stratified 1-sided p-value &lt;0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. the median pfs was 
 9.2 months (95% ci: 7.5, not estimable) for palbociclib plus fulvestrant and 3.8 months (95% ci: 3.5, 
 5.5) for placebo plus fulvestrant, and the difference in medians between arms was 5.7 months.</p><p>
 in a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses hr remained stable around 0.4 in all analyses, indicating 
 robustness of the results.</p><p>
 a blinded independent central review (bicr) was performed on a randomly sampled subset constituting 
 40% (n=211) of the intention-to-treat (itt) population, showing hr 0.27, with similar median pfs in the 
 control arm at 3.7 months, but median not reached in the palbociclib arm.</p><p> 
 two updated efficacy analyses were performed based on investigator assessment. the latter occurred at 
 a median follow-up of over 15 months in both study arms, and an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 
 76%). this showed a pfs hr of 0.50 (0.36-0.59) and median the pfs was 11.2 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a 
 difference of 6.6 months in favour of the palbociclib-containing arm.</p><p>ema/53381/2018 
 page 51/54 
 in updated pfs subgroup analyses all subgroup hr point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results. pre-/perimenopausal patients and 
 postmenopausal patients had similar hrs, 0.46 and 0.52, respectively, both with confidence intervals 
 below 1.0. patients who had received 0 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting had a somewhat higher 
 hr point estimate (0.59) than those with 1 or 2 previous lines of therapy for metastatic disease (0.46 and 
 0.48), but with 95% confidence interval below 1.0. 
 the difference in or and cbr supports the pfs results. 
 at a pre-specified interim analysis of overall survival (os) (data cut-off date of 23 oct 2015), the event 
 rate was 21.5% of the total 521 patients (20.5% vs. 23.6%, for palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 
 placebo plus fulvestrant arm, respectively). no death in the palbociclib-containing arm was due to 
 toxicity.</p><p>
 with regard to patient-reported outcomes (pros), a time to event analysis was pre-specified for time to 
 deterioration (ttd), defined as first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in the symptom of pain 
 on study. statistically convincing and plausible results were achieved with a difference in median time to 
 deterioration of 8.0 vs 2.8 months, hr 0.6, p &lt;0.001.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>in patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, a rapid and high likelihood of response to therapy is of importance. chemotherapy is therefore recommended for this group of 
 patients, who were excluded from the paloma-3. a reference is made in section 4.4 of the smpc that 
 critical visceral disease has not been studied. this is considered sufficient, since clinical oncologists are 
 presumed to be aware of the general guidelines with regard to endocrine therapy and rapidly progressing 
 disease. 
 the addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant substantially improved on both the pfs and orr of the endocrine 
 backbone, also in the subgroup of patients with (non-critical) visceral disease. smaller or no improvement 
 was observed for time to tumour response (ttr) in the visceral subgroup. the observed ttrs around 4 
 months are difficult to contextualise due to the limited published data on ttrs for chemotherapy. 
 information is included in the smpc section 5.1 to inform the prescriber of the orr and ttr results for 
 the visceral subgroups of paloma-3, and to reflect that patients who had symptomatic visceral disease 
 and were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term and/or had over 50% liver 
 involvement were excluded from the study.</p><p>
 os data for the pivotal study are immature and have not been presented due to immaturity (21% event 
 rate). given the large treatment effect observed on pfs, and the assessment of deaths, which did not 
 raise any new safety concerns, a detrimental effect of palbociclib on os is considered unlikely.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>the safety assessment for this new indication is based on the safety database from pivotal study paloma-3 (study 1023).</p><p>
 no new safety issues with regard to fulvestrant were raised from this study.</p><p>
 the most frequently reported teaes were associated with neutropenia, largely derived from 
 myelosuppression, leading to temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions. other 
 frequently reported teaes were fatigue, infections, nausea, arthralgia, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhoea</p><p>ema/53381/2018 
 page 52/54 
 and alopecia. most of the teaes were of grade 1 or grade 2 maximum severity except for neutropenia and leukopenia reported most commonly as a grade 3 teae. 
 considering the overall high incidence and severity of neutropenia, it is notable that overall few cases of 
 febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection have been reported. given the fairly low 
 proportion of permanent discontinuations in relation to the high proportion of temporary discontinuations, 
 it appears that neutropenia is in most cases successfully managed by measures such as dose reductions 
 and dose interruptions.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>a prolongation of progression-free survival by 6.6 months in the early metastatic settings of breast cancer is clinically relevant and meaningful.</p><p>
 the main safety risk associated with the combination with palbociclib is bone marrow suppression, 
 essentially neutropenia that led to dose delay and dose reductions in about 1/3 patients. haematological 
 toxicity is common for cytotoxic drugs and can be managed relatively easy. neutropenic infections were 
 uncommon. there is also no indication of a cumulative toxicity.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 discussion on the benefit-risk assessment</header><p>pfs results appear robust with regard to the level of statistical significance across analyses, the consistency of results in a number of pfs sensitivity analyses and in subgroups, and in terms of support 
 from orr and cbr analyses. given the large treatment-effect on pfs, and that the evaluation of deaths 
 on study and during follow-up did not raise concerns, a detrimental effect of palbociclib on os is 
 considered unlikely. study 1023 (paloma-3) is immature with regard to overall survival (os), at event 
 rates of 21%. the lack of mature data on overall survival will be addressed post-authorisation by the 
 ibrance mah. 
 the add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in events 
 of myelosuppression, mainly grade 3 neutropenia which is successfully managed through temporary dose 
 reduction and dose interruption. in general, the adrs are considered manageable and tolerable.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.
