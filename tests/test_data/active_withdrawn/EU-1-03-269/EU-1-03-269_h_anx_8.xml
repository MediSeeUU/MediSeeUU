 special population 
 renal impairment no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 ≥30 ml/min). safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these 
 patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>hepatic impairment no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>paediatric population 
 the safety and efficacy of faslodex in children from birth to 18 years of age have not been 
 established. currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on 
 a posology can be made.</p><p>
 method of administration 
 faslodex should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular injection 
 (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock.</p><p>

 faslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 less than 30 ml/min).</p><p>
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, faslodex should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.</p><p>
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical trials with faslodex (see section 4.8). this should be taken into consideration 
 when prescribing faslodex to patients at risk.</p><p>
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. due to the mechanism of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 faslodex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not been 
 established in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of cyp3a4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp3a4. clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp3a4) and 
 ketoconazole (inhibitor of cyp3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance.

 pregnancy 
 faslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). fulvestrant has been shown to cross the 
 placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. studies in animals have shown reproductive 
 toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). if 
 pregnancy occurs while taking faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.</p><p>
 breastfeeding 
 breastfeeding must be discontinued during treatment with faslodex. fulvestrant is excreted in milk in 
 lactating rats. it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. considering the potential 
 for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is 
 contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p><p>

 patients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>this section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-marketing studies or spontaneous reports. the most frequently reported adverse reactions are injection site 
 reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic enzymes (alt, ast, alp).</p><p>
 the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (adrs) were calculated based on the 
 faslodex 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of the confirm (study d6997c00002),

 assessment of causality.</p><p>
 adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (soc). 
 frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10),

 (see section 5.3). if overdose occurs, symptomatic supportive treatment is recommended.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, anti-estrogens, atc code: l02ba03</p><p> 
 mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
 fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
 fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
 the mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels.</p><p>
 clinical trials in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
 significantly down-regulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was 
 also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic 
 estrogen agonist effects. it has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates er and the 
 proliferation marker ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in 
 postmenopausal neoadjuvant setting.</p><p>
 clinical safety and efficacy in advanced breast cancer 
 a phase iii clinical trial was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer 
 who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine 
 therapy for advanced disease. the study included 423 patients whose disease had recurred or 
 progressed during anti-estrogen therapy (ae subgroup) and 313 patients whose disease had recurred 
 or progressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (ai subgroup). this trial compared the efficacy and 
 safety of faslodex 500 mg (n=362) with faslodex 250 mg (n=374). progression-free survival (pfs) 
 was the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (orr), 
 clinical benefit rate (cbr) and overall survival (os). efficacy results for the confirm study are 
 summarized in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2 summary of results of the primary efficacy endpoint (pfs) and key secondary

 two phase iii clinical trials were completed in a total of 851 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression 
 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. 77% of the study population had estrogen receptor 
 positive breast cancer. these trials compared the safety and efficacy of monthly administration of 
 faslodex 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). overall, 
 faslodex at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of progression-
 free survival, objective response, and time to death. there were no statistically significant differences 
 in any of these endpoints between the two treatment groups. progression-free survival was the primary 
 endpoint. combined analysis of both trials showed that 83% of patients who received faslodex 
 progressed, compared with 85% of patients who received anastrozole. combined analysis of both 
 trials showed the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg to anastrozole for progression-free survival was 
 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10). the objective response rate for faslodex 250 mg was 19.2% compared 
 with 16.5% for anastrozole. the median time to death was 27.4 months for patients treated with 
 faslodex and 27.6 months for patients treated with anastrozole. the hazard ratio of faslodex 250 mg 
 to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci 0.86 to 1.19).</p><p>
 effects on the postmenopausal endometrium preclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium (see section 5.3). a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day 
 ethinylestradiol showed that pre-treatment with faslodex 250 mg resulted in significantly reduced 
 stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged 
 by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness.</p><p>
 7 neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either faslodex 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial thickness, 
 indicating a lack of agonist effect. there is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the breast 
 cancer patients studied. no data are available regarding endometrial morphology.</p><p>
 in two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
 disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measurement 
 between fulvestrant and placebo groups.</p><p>
 effects on bone there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either faslodex 500 mg or faslodex 250 mg did not result in 
 clinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers.</p><p>
 paediatric population 
 faslodex is not indicated for use in children. the european medicines agency has waived the 
 obligation to submit the results of studies with faslodex in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
 breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).</p><p>
 an open-label phase ii study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant in 
 30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with progressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright 
 syndrome (mas). the paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of 
 fulvestrant. this 12-month study investigated a range of mas endpoints and showed a reduction in the 
 frequency of vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. the steady-state 
 trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that in adults (see 
 section 5.2). there were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-year data are yet 
 not available.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption</p><p>after administration of faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed 
 and maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) are reached after about 5 days. administration of faslodex 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month 
 of dosing (mean [cv]: auc 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, c
 max 25.1 [35.1%] ng/ml, cmin 16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained within a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and 
 trough concentrations. after intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately 
 dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg.</p><p>
 distribution 
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. the large apparent volume of distribution at 
 steady state (vd
 ss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. very low density lipoprotein (vldl), low 
 density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are the major binding 
 components. no interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. the role of sex 
 hormone-binding globulin (shbg) has not been determined.</p><p>
 biotransformation</p><p>the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of 
 possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. identified metabolites 
 (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or 
 exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-estrogen models. studies using human liver preparations 
 and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme involved in the 
 oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo. in vitro data suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes. 8</p><p>elimination fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. the major route of excretion is via the faeces, 
 with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) after intramuscular administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase iii studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s 
 pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.</p><p>
 renal impairment mild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical trial conducted in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b). a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold increase 
 in auc in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. in patients administered 
 faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated.</p><p>subjects with 
 severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) were not evaluated.</p><p>
 paediatric population the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical trial conducted in 30 girls with progressive precocious puberty associated with mccune albright syndrome (see section 5.1). the 
 paediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of 
 fulvestrant. the geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (cmin,ss) and 
 aucss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/ml and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/ml, respectively. although the data collected 
 were limited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to be consistent 
 with those in adults.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.</p><p> 
 faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies. local reactions, including myositis and granulomata at the injection site were attributed 
 to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to the saline 
 control. in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, the anti-
 estrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in the 
 female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes. arteritis 
 involving a range of different tissues was seen in some dogs after chronic (12 months) dosing.</p><p>
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen. these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt;15 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.</p><p>
 fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
 anti-estrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats, a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed. rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in 
 9 placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral 
 vertebrae).</p><p>
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males. in a two-year mouse 
 oncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of ovarian sex cord 
 stromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. at the no-effect 
 level for these findings, systemic exposure levels (auc) were, in rats, approximately 1.5–fold the 
 expected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-fold 
 the expected human exposure levels in both males and females. induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by 
 anti-estrogens in cycling animals. therefore these findings are not considered to be relevant to the use 
 of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>ethanol (96 per cent) benzyl alcohol</p><p>
