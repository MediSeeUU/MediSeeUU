 follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. the start

 in 316 newborns of women administered cetrorelix for 
 infertility treatments suggest that cetrorelix does not 
 increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the offsprings.
  no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been 
 performed with cetrorelix. however, the possibility of 
 interactions with gonadotropins or products that may induce 
 histamine release in susceptible individuals cannot be totally 
 excluded.
  cetrorelix has not been studied in patients with hepatic 
 impairment and caution is therefore warranted. cetrorelix 
 has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and 
 caution is therefore warranted. cetrorelix is contraindicated 
 in patients with severe renal impairment.
  in addition, there is no contraindication against the use of 
 cetrorelix in postmenopausal women.
