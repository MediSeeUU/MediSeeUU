 in clinical trials cetrotide was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however, limited 
 experience with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested similar efficacy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>cetrotide should only be prescribed by a specialist experienced in this field.</p><p>
 posology 
 the first administration of cetrotide should be performed under the supervision of a physician and 
 under conditions where treatment of possible allergic/pseudo-allergic reactions (including 
 life-threatening anaphylaxis) is immediately available. the following injections may be 
 self-administered as long as the patient is made aware of the signs and symptoms that may indicate 
 hypersensitivity, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate medical intervention.</p><p>
 the contents of 1 vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in 
 the morning or in the evening. following the first administration, it is advised that the patient be kept 
 under medical supervision for 30 minutes to ensure there is no allergic/pseudo-allergic reaction to the 
 injection.</p><p>elderly there is no relevant use of cetrotide in the geriatric population.</p><p>
 paediatric population there is no relevant use of cetrotide in the paediatric population.</p><p>
 method of administration 
 cetrotide is for subcutaneous injection into the lower abdominal wall.</p><p>
 3</p><p>the injection site reactions may be minimised by rotating the injection sites, delaying injection at the same site and injecting the medicinal product in a slow rate to facilitate the progressive absorption of 
 the medicinal product.</p><p>
 administration in the morning</p><p>treatment with cetrotide should commence on day 5 or 6 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be 
 continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period including the day of ovulation induction. 
 the starting day of cetrotide is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of 
 growing follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. the start of cetrotide may be delayed in 
 absence of follicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting cetrotide on day 5 or 
 day 6 of stimulation.</p><p>
 administration in the evening</p><p>treatment with cetrotide should commence on day 5 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be 
 continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until the evening prior to the day of ovulation 
 induction. 
 the starting day of cetrotide is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of 
 growing follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. the start of cetrotide may be delayed in 
 absence of follicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting cetrotide on day 5 or 
 day 6 of stimulation.</p><p>
 for instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>cetrorelix is not to be used in the presence of any of the conditions listed below: • hypersensitivity to the active substance or any structural analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh), extrinsic peptide hormones or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
 • during pregnancy and lactation. • patients with severe renal impairment.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>allergic conditions cases of allergic/pseudoallergic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis with the first dose 
 have been reported (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions or 
 known history of allergic predisposition. treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with 
 severe allergic conditions.</p><p>
 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) 
 during or following ovarian stimulation an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event 
 must be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins</p><p>
 an ohss should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous electrolytes/colloids and 
 heparin therapy.</p><p>
 luteal phase support should be given according to the reproductive medical centre´s practice.</p><p>
 repeated ovarian stimulation procedure</p><p>
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrorelix during a repeated ovarian 
 stimulation procedure. therefore, cetrorelix should be used in repeated cycles only after a careful 
 benefit/risk evaluation. 
 4</p><p>congenital anomalies the prevalence of congenital anomalies after the use of assisted reproductive technologies (art) with 
 or without gnrh antagonists may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions although it is 
 unclear whether this is related to factors inherent to the couple&apos;s infertility or the art procedures. 
 limited data from clinical follow-up studies in 316 newborns of women administered cetrorelix for 
 infertility treatments suggest that cetrorelix does not increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the 
 offsprings.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment 
 cetrorelix has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and caution is therefore warranted.</p><p>
 renal impairment 
 cetrorelix has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and caution is therefore warranted.</p><p>
 cetrorelix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with cetrorelix. in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochrome 
 p450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. however, the possibility of interactions with 
 gonadotropins or medicinal products that may induce histamine release in susceptible individuals, 
 cannot be totally excluded.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy and breast-feeding cetrotide is not intended to be used during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 fertility 
 studies in animals have indicated that cetrorelix exerts a dose related influence on fertility, 
 reproductive performance and pregnancy. no teratogenic effects occurred when the medicinal product 
 was administered during the sensitive phase of gestation.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>cetrotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profile the most commonly reported adverse reactions are local injection site reactions such as erythema, 
 swelling and pruritus that are usually transient in nature and mild in intensity. in clinical trials, these 
 effects were observed with a frequency of 9.4% following multiple injections of cetrotide 0.25 mg.</p><p>
 mild to moderate ohss (who grade i or ii) have been commonly reported and should be considered 
 as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. inversely, severe ohss remains uncommon.</p><p>
 uncommonly, cases of hypersensitivity reactions including pseudo-allergic/anaphylactoid reactions 
 have been reported.</p><p>
 list of adverse reactions 
 the adverse reactions reported below are classified according to frequency of occurrence as follows: 
 very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 
 to &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000).</p><p>
 5 immune system disorders uncommon: systemic allergic/pseudo-allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 nervous system disorders uncommon: headache</p><p>
 gastrointestinal disorders uncommon: nausea</p><p>
 reproductive system and breast disorders common: mild to moderate ohss (who grade i or ii) can occur which is an intrinsic risk of 
 the stimulation procedure (see section 4.4). 
 uncommon: 
 severe ohss (who grade iii)</p><p>
 general disorders and administration site conditions common: local reactions at the injection site (e.g. erythema, swelling and pruritus).</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v
 .</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>overdosage in humans may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with acute toxic effects.</p><p>
 in acute toxicity studies in rodents non-specific toxic symptoms were observed after intraperitoneal 
 administration of cetrorelix doses more than 200 times higher than the pharmacologically effective 
 dose after subcutaneous administration.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormones, atc code: h01cc02.</p><p>
 mechanism of action 
 cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist. lhrh binds to membrane 
 receptors on pituitary cells. cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous lhrh to these 
 receptors. due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (lh and 
 fsh).</p><p>
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland. the onset 
 of suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial 
 stimulatory effect.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety 
 in females, cetrorelix delays the lh surge and consequently ovulation. in women undergoing ovarian 
 stimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. at a dose of 0.25 mg per injection 
 repeated injections every 24 hours will maintain the effect of cetrorelix.</p><p>
 in animals as well as in humans, the antagonistic hormonal effects of cetrorelix were fully reversible 
 after termination of treatment.</p><p>
 6</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption the absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix after subcutaneous administration is about 85%.</p><p>
 distribution 
 the volume of distribution (v
 d) is 1.1 l x kg-1.</p><p>
 elimination 
 the total plasma clearance and the renal clearance are 1.2 ml x min
 -1 x kg-1 and 0.1 ml x min-1 x kg-1, respectively.</p><p>
 the mean terminal half-lives following intravenous and subcutaneous administration are about 12 h 
 and 30 h, respectively, demonstrating the effect of absorption processes at the injection site.</p><p>
 linearity 
 the subcutaneous administration of single doses (0.25 mg to 3 mg cetrorelix) and also daily dosing 
 over 14 days show linear kinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.</p><p>
 no target organ toxicity could be observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats 
 and dogs following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix. no signs of medicinal product-related 
 local irritation or incompatibility were noted in dogs after intravenous, intraarterial and paravenous 
 injection when cetrorelix was administered in doses clearly above the intended clinical use in man.</p><p>
 cetrorelix showed no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in gene and chromosome mutation assays.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder mannitol</p><p>

   what cetrotide is</header><p>cetrotide contains a medicine called ‘cetrorelix’. this medicine stops your body from releasing an egg from your ovary (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. cetrotide belongs to a group of medicines 
 called ‘anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormones’.</p></section><section><header>what cetrotide is used for</header><p>cetrotide is one of the medicines used during ‘assisted reproductive techniques’ to help you get pregnant. it stops eggs being released straight away. this is because if the eggs are released too early 
 (premature ovulation) it may not be possible for your doctor to collect them.</p></section><section><header>how cetrotide works</header><p>cetrotide blocks a natural hormone in your body called lhrh (‘luteinising hormone releasing hormone’). 
 • lhrh controls another hormone, called lh (‘luteinising hormone’). • lh stimulates ovulation during your menstrual cycle.</p><p> 
 this means that cetrotide stops the chain of events that leads to an egg being released from your 
 ovary. when your eggs are ready to be collected, another medicine will be given to you that will 
 release them (ovulation induction).</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you use cetrotide
   do not use cetrotide</header><p>• if you are allergic to cetrorelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
 • if you are allergic to medicines similar to cetrotide (any other peptide hormones). • if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. • if you have severe kidney disease.</p><p>
 20 do not use cetrotide if any of the above applies to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>allergies tell your doctor before using cetrotide if you have an active allergy or have had allergies in the past.</p><p>
 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) 
 cetrotide is used together with other medicines that stimulate your ovaries to develop more eggs ready 
 to be released. during or after you receive these medicines, you may develop ohss. this is when 
 your follicles develop too much and become large cysts.</p><p>
 for possible signs to look out for and what to do if this happens see section 4 ‘
 possible side effects’.</p><p>
 using cetrotide during more than one cycle 
 experience of using cetrotide during more than one cycle is small. your doctor will carefully look at 
 the benefits and risks for you, if you need to have cetrotide during more than one cycle.</p><p>
 liver disease 
 tell your doctor before using cetrotide if you have a liver disease. cetrotide has not been investigated 
 in patients with hepatic disease.</p><p>
 kidney disease
