 in clinical trials cetrotide was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however, limited 
 experience with recombinant follicule-stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested similar efficacy.</p></section><section><header n="4.2">4.2 posology and method of administration</header><p>cetrotide should only be prescribed by a specialist experienced in this field.</p><p>
 the first administration of cetrotide should be performed under the supervision of a physician and 
 under conditions where treatment of possible allergic/pseudo-allergic reactions (including life-
 threatening anaphylaxis) is immediately available. the following injections may be self-administered 
 as long as the patient is made aware of the signs and symptoms that may indicate hypersensitivity, the 
 consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate medical intervention.</p><p>
 the contents of 1 vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in 
 the morning or in the evening. following the first administration, it is advised that the patient be kept 
 under medical supervision for 30 minutes to ensure there is no allergic/pseudo-allergic reaction to the 
 injection.</p><p>
 cetrotide is for subcutaneous injection into the lower abdominal wall.</p><p>
 the injection site reactions may be minimised by rotating the injection sites, delaying injection at the 
 same site and injecting the product in a slow rate to facilitate the progressive absorption of the product.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide should commence on day 5 or 6 of ovarian 
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period 
 including the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>2 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide should commence on day 5 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until 
 the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>
 additional information on special populations:</p><p>
 there is no relevant indication for the use of cetrotide in children or geriatric populations.</p><p>
 for instructions for preparation, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any structural analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh), extrinsic peptide hormones or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 • patients with moderate and severe renal and hepatic impairment.</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions or known history of allergic predisposition. treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with 
 severe allergic conditions.</p><p>
 during or following ovarian stimulation an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event 
 must be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins.</p><p>an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous 
 electrolytes/colloids and heparin therapy.</p><p>
 luteal phase support should be given according to the reproductive medical centre´s practice.</p><p>
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide during a repeated ovarian 
 stimulation procedure. therefore cetrotide should be used in repeated cycles only after a careful 
 risk/benefit evaluation.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochrome p450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. however, 
 although there has been no evidence of drug-interactions, especially with commonly used medicinal 
 products, gonadotropins or products that may induce histamine release in susceptible individuals, the 
 possibility of an interaction cannot be totally excluded.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>cetrotide is not intended to be used during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 studies in animals have indicated that cetrorelix exerts a dose related influence on fertility, 
 reproductive performance and pregnancy. no teratogenic effects occurred when the medicinal product 
 was administered during the sensitive phase of gestation.</p><p>3</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>cetrotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>the most commonly reported side effects are local injection site reactions such as erythema, swelling and pruritus that are usually transient in nature and mild in intensity. in clinical trials, these effects 
 were observed with a frequency of 9.4% following multiple injections of cetrotide 0.25 mg.</p><p>
 mild to moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) (who grade i or ii) have been 
 commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. 
 inversely, severe ohss remains uncommon.</p><p>
 uncommonly, cases of hypersensitivity reactions including pseudo-allergic/anaphylactoid reactions 
 have been reported.</p><p>
 the adverse reactions reported below are classified according to frequency of occurrence as follows:</p><p> very common</p><p> ≥ 1/10</p><p> common</p><p> ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10</p><p> uncommon</p><p> ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100</p><p> rare</p><p> ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000</p><p> very rare</p><p> &lt; 1/10,000</p><p>

 the frequency as reported in 
 clinical trials was 9.4% 
 following multiple injections of 
 0.25 mg cetrorelix.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>overdosage in humans may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with acute toxic effects.</p><p>4 in acute toxicity studies in rodents non-specific toxic symptoms were observed after intraperitoneal administration of cetrorelix doses more than 200 times higher than the pharmacologically effective 
 dose after subcutaneous administration.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormones, atc code: h01cc02.</p><p>
 cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist. lhrh binds to membrane 
 receptors on pituitary cells. cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous lhrh to these 
 receptors. due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (lh and 
 fsh).</p><p>
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland. the onset 
 of suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial 
 stimulatory effect.</p><p>
 in females, cetrorelix delays the lh surge and consequently ovulation. in women undergoing ovarian 
 stimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. following a single dose of 3 mg of 
 cetrorelix a duration of action of at least 4 days has been evaluated. on day 4 the suppression was 
 approximately 70%. at a dose of 0.25 mg per injection repeated injections every 24 hours will 
 maintain the effect of cetrorelix.</p><p>
 in animals as well as in humans, the antagonistic hormonal effects of cetrorelix were fully reversible 
 after termination of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>the absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix after subcutaneous administration is about 85%.</p><p>
 the total plasma clearance and the renal clearance are 1.2 ml x min
 -1 x kg-1 and 0.1 ml x min-1 x kg-1 , respectively. the volume of distribution (v
 d) is 1.1 l x kg-1. the mean terminal half-lives following intravenous and subcutaneous administration are about 12 h and 30 h, respectively, demonstrating the 
 effect of absorption processes at the injection site. the subcutaneous administration of single doses 
 (0.25 mg to 3 mg cetrorelix) and also daily dosing over 14 days show linear kinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.</p><p>
 no target organ toxicity could be observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats 
 and dogs following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix. no signs of medicinal product-related 
 local irritation or incompatibility were noted in dogs after intravenous, intra-arterial and paravenous 
 injection when cetrorelix was administered in doses clearly above the intended clinical use in man.</p><p>
 cetrorelix showed no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in gene and chromosome mutation assays.</p><p>5</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: mannitol</p><p>

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what cetrotide is and what it is used for</header><p>cetrotide blocks the receptors of a natural hormone, called luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) and thus indirectly the effect of this hormone. lhrh controls the production and release of 
 another hormone, called luteinising hormone (lh) which stimulates ovulation during the menstrual 
 cycle.</p><p>
 cetrotide is used to prevent the premature release of lh and thus, the premature release from the 
 ovaries of an egg (oocyte) (i.e. premature ovulation) that may be immature. premature ovulation is 
 actually undesirable during treatment inducing ovaries to produce more eggs (ovarian stimulation) as 
 premature release of lh triggers oocytes release before it is possible to collect them (oocyte pick-up) 
 by a simple procedure for assisted reproductive technologies.</p><p>
 in clinical trials cetrotide was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg). limited, post-
 marketing experience with another hormone, i.e. recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) 
 suggested similar efficacy. hmg and fsh are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use cetrotide
   do not use cetrotide</header><p>• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cetrorelix acetate,</p><p>exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similar to cetrotide) or any of the other ingredients. 
 • if you are pregnant or breast-feeding • if you have already reached your menopause • if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>take special care with cetrotide</header><p>special care should be taken in women with an active allergic condition or a known history of allergy.</p><p>if you present such a condition, it is important that you inform your doctor.</p><p>29during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg 
 maturation). for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient information leaflet of the 
 gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to increase the uterus receptivity to embryo implantation and to 
 support early pregnancy, generally by administering progesterone or human chorionic gonadotropin) 
 should be given according to the reproductive medical centre’s practice.</p><p>
 because experience of using cetrotide during repeated ovarian stimulation procedures is still small, 
 you should use the medicine in repeated cycles only after your doctor has carefully evaluated the 
 benefits and risks.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medicines that are degraded by the liver. however, though there has been no evidence of drug- interactions, especially with 
 commonly used medicines, gonadotropins or products that may induce histamine release in susceptible 
 individuals, the possibility of an interaction cannot be totally excluded.</p><p>
 please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
 including medicines obtained without a prescription.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>you must not use cetrotide if you are already pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>the use of cetrotide is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use cetrotide</header><p>always use cetrotide exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor if you are not sure. the following statements apply to cetrotide unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. 
 please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide.</p><p>
 cetrotide is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin. it is for 
 single use only.</p><p> 
 the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor. you can carry out the following 
 injections yourself as long as your doctor has made you aware of the symptoms that may indicate 
 allergy and of its consequences (serious, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, causing 
 difficulty in breathing or dizziness, may occur and need immediate treatment).</p><p>
 cetrotide is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. to 
 minimise local irritation, please select a different injection site each day and inject slowly.</p><p>
 dissolve cetrotide powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use a 
 cetrotide solution if it is not clear or contains particles.</p></section><section><header>before you administer cetrotide yourself, please read the following instructions carefully</header><p>1. wash your hands. your hands and all items you use should be as clean as possible.</p><p>302. lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection 
 needle with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an 
 alcohol swab.</p><p>
 4. take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled 
 syringe and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 5. push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial 
 by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without 
 residue. avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.</p><p>
 7. draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert the vial, 
 pull back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from 
 the side through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the 
 liquid. make sure that you withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>
 8. detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the 
 grey mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the 
 needle.</p><p>
 9. invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch 
 the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the 
 second alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand. 
 gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.</p><p>
 11. hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at an 
 angle of about 45 degree.</p><p>
 12. once the needle has been inserted completely, release your grasp of the skin.</p><p>
 13. pull back gently the plunger of the syringe. if blood appears continue as described in step 14. if 
 no blood appears, inject the solution slowly by pushing the plunger gently forward. after all of 
 the solution is injected, withdraw the needle slowly, applying gentle pressure with the alcohol 
 swab on the skin where the needle was inserted. withdraw the needle at the same angle as it was 
 inserted.</p><p>
 14. if blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently apply pressure to the injection 
 site. do not use this solution but empty the syringe in a sink. start again with step 1.</p><p>
 15. use the syringe and needles only once. throw away the syringe and needles immediately after 
 use (put the covers on the needles to avoid injury).</p><p>the contents of one vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be injected once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in 
 the morning or in the evening.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide should begin on day 5 or 6 of ovarian 
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropin(s) and is to be continued throughout the ovarian stimulation treatment 
 period including the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>31administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide should begin on day 5 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant 
 gonadotropin(s) and is to be continued throughout the ovarian stimulation treatment period until the 
 evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>if you use more cetrotide than you should</header><p>overdosage of cetrotide may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with sudden untoward/damaging effects. therefore, in case of overdosage no specific measures are 
 required.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take cetrotide</header><p>do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.</p><p>
 ideally cetrotide should be injected at 24 hours intervals. but if you missed giving it at the right time 
 you can inject this dose at a different time of the same day.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, cetrotide can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>

 further information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what cetrotide is and what it is used for</header><p>cetrotide blocks the receptors of a natural hormone, called luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) and thus indirectly the effect of this hormone. lhrh controls the production and release of 
 another hormone, called luteinising hormone (lh) which stimulates ovulation during the menstrual 
 cycle.</p><p>
 cetrotide is used to prevent the premature release of lh and thus, the premature release from the 
 ovaries of an egg (oocyte) (i.e. premature ovulation) that may be immature. premature ovulation is 
 actually undesirable during treatment inducing ovaries to produce more eggs (ovarian stimulation) as 
 premature release of lh triggers oocytes release before it is possible to collect them (oocyte pick-up) 
 by a simple procedure for assisted reproductive technologies.</p><p>
 in clinical trials cetrotide</p><p>was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg). limited, post-
 marketing experience with another hormone, i.e. recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) 
 suggested similar efficacy. hmg and fsh are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use cetrotide
   do not use cetrotide</header><p>• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cetrorelix acetate,</p><p>exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similar to cetrotide) or any of the other ingredients. 
 • if you are pregnant or breast-feeding • if you have already reached your menopause • if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>take special care with cetrotide</header><p>special care should be taken in women with an active allergic condition or a known history of allergy.</p><p>if you present such a condition, it is important that you inform your doctor.</p><p>36during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg 
 maturation). for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient information leaflet of the 
 gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to increase the uterus receptivity to embryo implantation and to 
 support early pregnancy, generally by administering progesterone or human chorionic gonadotropin) 
 should be given according to the reproductive medical centre’s practice.</p><p>
 because experience of using cetrotide</p><p>during repeated ovarian stimulation procedures is still small, 
 you should use</p><p>the medicine in repeated cycles only after your doctor has carefully evaluated the 
 benefits and risks.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines</header><p>in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medicines that are degraded by the liver. however, though there has been no evidence of drug- interactions, especially with 
 commonly used medicines, gonadotropins or products that may induce histamine release in susceptible 
 individuals, the possibility of an interaction cannot be totally excluded.</p><p>
 please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
 including medicines obtained without a prescription.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>you must not use cetrotide if you are already pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>the use of cetrotide is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use cetrotide</header><p>always use cetrotide exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor if you are not sure. the following statements apply to cetrotide unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. 
 please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide.</p><p>
 cetrotide is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin. it is for 
 single use only.</p><p>
 the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor. you can carry out the following 
 injections yourself as long as your doctor has made you aware of the symptoms that may indicate 
 allergy and of its consequences (serious, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, causing 
 difficulty in breathing or dizziness, may occur and need immediate treatment).</p><p>
 cetrotide is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. to 
 minimise local irritation, please inject slowly.</p><p>
 dissolve cetrotide powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use a 
 cetrotide solution if it is not clear or contains particles.</p><p>37</p></section><section><header>before you administer cetrotide yourself, please read the following instructions carefully</header><p>1. wash your hands. your hands and all items you use should be as clean as possible.</p><p>
 2. lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection 
 needle with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an 
 alcohol swab.</p><p>
 4. take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled 
 syringe and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 5. push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial 
 by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without 
 residue. avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.</p><p>
 7. draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert the vial, 
 pull back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from 
 the side through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the 
 liquid. make sure that you withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>
 8. detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the 
 grey mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the 
 needle.</p><p>
 9. invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch 
 the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the 
 second alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand. 
 gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.</p><p>
 11. hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at an 
 angle of about 45 degree.</p><p>
 12. once the needle has been inserted completely, release your grasp of the skin.</p><p>
 13. pull back gently the plunger of the syringe. if blood appears continue as described in step 14. if 
 no blood appears, inject the solution slowly by pushing the plunger gently forward. after all of 
 the solution is injected, withdraw the needle slowly, applying gentle pressure with the alcohol 
 swab on the skin where the needle was inserted. withdraw the needle at the same angle as it was 
 inserted.</p><p>
 14. if blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently apply pressure to the injection 
 site. do not use this solution but empty the syringe in a sink.</p><p>
 15. use the syringe and needles only once. throw away the syringe and needles immediately after 
 use (put the covers on the needles to avoid injury).</p><p>the contents of 1 vial (3 mg cetrorelix) are to be injected on day 7 of ovarian stimulation 
 (approximately 132 to 144 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant 
 gonadotropins.</p><p> 38a single dose of cetrotide 3 mg results in a duration of action of at least 4 days. if the follicle growth does not allow ovulation induction on the fifth day after injection of cetrotide 3 mg, additionally 
 0.25 mg cetrorelix (cetrotide 0.25 mg) should be administered once daily beginning 96 hours after the 
 injection of cetrotide 3 mg until the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>if you use more cetrotide than you should</header><p>overdosage of cetrotide may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with sudden untoward/damaging effects. therefore, in case of overdosage no specific measures are 
 required.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take cetrotide</header><p>do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, cetrotide can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>
