 grounds for the comp opinion</header></section><section><header n="2.1">2.1.  
 orphan medicinal product designation</header><p>the comp opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2014 was based on the following grounds: 
 the sponsor kite pharma uk, ltd submitted on 20 august 2014 an application for designation as an 
 orphan medicinal product to the european medicines agency for a medicinal product containing 
 autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric 
 antigen receptor for treatment of diffuse large b cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the 
 condition”). the application was submitted on the basis of article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of regulation 
 (ec) no 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
 having examined the application, the comp considered that the sponsor has established the following: • the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric antigen receptor 
 was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing anti-cancer activity in patients 
 with refractory disease; 
 • the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening with 5-year survival 
 rates reported as low as approximately one in four patients for the high risk group; 
 • the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.4 in 10,000 persons in the european union, at the time the application was made. 
 thus, the requirements under article 3(1)(a) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
 products are fulfilled. 
 in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
 european union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
 product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 
 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric antigen receptor may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
 condition. the sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data showing a favourable response in patients 
 with progressive disease who are refractory to previous treatments. the committee considered that 
 this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
 thus, the requirement under article 3(1)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
 products is fulfilled. 
 the comp concludes that the requirements laid down in article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of regulation (ec) 
 no 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. the comp therefore recommends the 
 designation of this medicinal product, containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector 
 encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric antigen receptor as an orphan medicinal product for 
 the orphan indication: treatment of diffuse large b cell lymphoma.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of 
 marketing authorisation</header><p>the comp opinion on the initial review of the orphan medicinal product designation in 2018 was based on the following grounds: 
 • the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the designated orphan medicinal product; 
 • the prevalence of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
 european union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
 • the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening with 5-year survival rates reported as low as approximately 25% for high risk patients; 
 • although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the assumption that yescarta may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
 orphan condition still holds. the sponsor has provided clinical data showing responses in patients 
 with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, which compare favourably to responses 
 with existing treatments in historical controls. the comp considers that this constitutes a clinically 
 relevant advantage. 
 the comp, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of article 
 5(12)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
 • the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; • the criteria for designation as set out in article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. the committee for orphan medicinal products has recommended that yescarta, autologous t cells 
 transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel, eu/3/14/1393 for treatment of diffuse large b cell lymphoma is not removed 
 from the community register of orphan medicinal products.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 application is made 
 condition</header><p>diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) is the most common subtype of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl) in adults. it comprises a group of aggressive lymphoid malignancies that accounts for around 
 30% to 40% of all nhl cases globally (chaganti et al., 2016). patients with dlbcl often present with 
 single or multiple rapidly enlarging symptomatic masses, with up to 40% occurring at extra-nodal sites 
 (martelli et al., 2013). the disease usually affects adults, especially around 60 to 70 years, but also 
 rarely occurs in adolescents and children. hereditary and acquired immunodeficiencies, occupational 
 exposures, and pharmacological immunosuppression in the setting of transplantation or treatment of 
 autoimmune diseases have been identified as factors thought to potentially confer increased risk of 
 developing dlbcl. 
 dlbcl often arises de novo, but it can also represent a malignant progression or transformation of a 
 less aggressive lymphoma (e.g., follicular lymphoma [fl], chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [cll], small 
 lymphocytic lymphoma and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; martelli et al., 2013). the 
 most frequently dysregulated genes include bcl6 (rearrangement in 35%−40%; mutation in 5
 ′ noncoding region in 70%), bcl2 (translocation 15%, amplification 24%), and cmyc (5%−15%; skinnider et al. 1999). 
 in recognition of the unique clinical and pathological features of dlbcl subtypes and associated 
 therapeutic implications, the world health organization (who) made several changes to the 
 classification of lymphoid neoplasms in 2016. the different entities previously categorized as dlbcl 
 subtypes were separated from dlbcl, nos. cell of origin subtypes (gcb and abc) were formally 
 recognized for dlbcl, nos, whereas double- and triple-hit lymphomas were included in a new 
 category of large b-cell lymphoma (lbcl) called high-grade b-cell lymphoma (hgbl), which is distinct 
 from dlbcl (sehn et al., 2021; swerdlow et al., 2016). according to the 2016 who classification, 
 hgbl comprises 2 subcategories: (1) hgbl with myc, bcl2, and/or bcl6 translocations, which 
 includes lbcl with myc, bcl2, and/or bcl6 rearrangements, also known as “double- or triple-hit” 
 lymphomas, and excludes follicular lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma; and 2) hgbl nos, which 
 includes lbcl that are cytologically “high-grade” and would previously be characterized as b-cell 
 lymphoma unclassifiable, and lack genetic features of double- or triple-hit lymphomas (swerdlow et 
 al., 2016). consequently, the aggressive b-cell nhl subset lbcl now includes both dlbcl (including 
 dlbcl nos and other dlbcl subgroups) and hgbl subtypes, in addition to primary mediastinal large 
 b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl). dlbcl accounts for &gt;80% of all cases of lbcl and hgbl accounts for up to 
 13% of the lbcl cases. 
 the approved extension of the therapeutic indication “
 yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and high-grade b-cell lymphoma (hgbl) that 
 relapses within 12 months from completion of, or is refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy
 ” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma”.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 threatening nature of the disease. while around 50% of newly diagnosed patients can be cured with 
 the standard first-line immuno-chemotherapy r-chop/choep, prognosis remains particularly poor in 
 those patients being refractory to first-line treatment (about 10-15%), with an os of less than 1 year. 
 in addition, patients with double-hit lymphoma or myc and bcl-2 protein double-expressor 
 lymphomas are associated with poorer response to standard immuno-chemotherapy with a median os 
 of less than 12 months (petrich et al., 2014; tumati et al., 2018). poor outcomes are also observed 
 among patients who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation (sct) (median os: 6 to 11 months) or 
 have refractory disease after any line of treatment (median os: 6.1 to 7.1 months) (arcari et al., 
 2016; crump et al., 2017; czuczman et al., 2017). 
 the sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of the proposed condition since the 
 orphan designation (od) in 2014 and the maintenance of the od criteria at the time of marketing 
 authorisation in 2018. the comp has previously acknowledged that the clinical course of dlbcl 
 (including hgbl) can be chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
 lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that may 
 lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening in patients not responding to 
 treatment. the severe nature of the orphan condition earlier accepted by the comp remains acceptable 
 for this procedure.</p></section><section><header>number of people affected or at risk</header><p>the sponsor has conducted a literature search as well as accessing registry data to establish the prevalence of dlbcl (including hgbl) in europe: i) european cancer registries such as international 
 agency for research on cancer (iarc; eu28 as defined by who; 2020 data), national institute for 
 cancer epidemiology and registration (nicer; 2019 data), association of nordic cancer registries 
 (ancr: denmark, sweden, finland, norway, and iceland; 2018 data), and haematological malignancy 
 research network (hmrn: yorkshire region in the uk; 2004-2016 data), ii) online data platforms: 
 global burden of disease (gbd; eu28; 2019 data), and iii) databases: medline and google scholar. 
 apart from for hmrn, all other sources reported the prevalence of nhl. the dlbcl prevalence was 
 therefore indirectly calculated using the reported nhl prevalence. the sources used are summarized in

 *age and/sex standardized estimates 
 the sponsor proposed a dlbcl prevalence estimate that was indirectly calculated using the highest reported proportion of dlbcl (including hgbl) among nhl cases in europe of 47.8% based on 2004 to 
 2012 data from hmrn in the uk (smith et al., 2015) and the highest reported 5(1)-year nhl 
 prevalence (6.9 per 10,000) in europe derived from gbd 2019 data. the assumptions produce a final 
 calculation for the prevalence estimate of 3.3 per 10,000 persons in the european union (eu). the 
 sponsor emphasised that the proposed calculation of the prevalence included patients with hgbl. the 
 sponsor did not consult available data from the european cancer information system (ecis) database. 
 in a recent submission, the comp noted that if the population-based weighted incidence of dlbcl to 
 the ecis estimate of crude nhl incidence (1.94 per 10,000) for the 27 eu countries (eu27) is applied, 
 the estimated proportion of dlbcl among the overall nhl population is 35.6%. the comp also noted 
 that the os for dlbcl is expected to be higher than 5 years and that a 5-year partial prevalence 
 therefore is considered insufficient. recent estimates that have been considered generally have taken 
 the assumption that 10 years survival data should be used indicating that the prevalence is higher than 
 the estimate of 3.3 in 10,000 as currently presented.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000076832</p><p> 
 page 9/18</p><p>the sponsor was requested to provide a more current estimate based on relevant and comprehensive data sources in europe, including ecis, a dlbcl percentage within all nhl cases more in line with the 
 comp’s current understanding of approximately 35% and a 10-year disease duration. 
 in the revised prevalence estimate the sponsor has used data sources as recommended by the comp, 
 including ecis incidence data for 2020, and applied both direct and indirect approaches to estimate the 
 current dlbcl prevalence in the europe community. 
 direct method 
 a review of published literature and relevant online databases was conducted to search for 5-year or 
 higher prevalence estimates for dlbcl from studies published during 01-jan-2012 through 06-jun-
 2022. only studies examining individuals residing in the eu countries were considered. 
 the reported dlbcl prevalence estimates ranged from 2.13 to 2.84 per 10,000 for a 5-year partial 
 prevalence and 4.21 to 4.62 per 10,000 persons for a 10-year partial prevalence.</p></section><section><header>table 2.</header><p>sources of data for direct prevalence estimates of dlbcl</p></section><section><header>source country

 cases in 2020 at 5 years (n=31,052), divided by the 2020 population in spain.</p><p>the publication by smith and colleagues used an older set of data (2004-2014) from the hmrn (smith et al., 2015) than the most current estimates that are available (2006-2016). results of 5- and 10-
 year dlbcl prevalence were nearly identical across the data sets. the cancer prevalence estimates 
 provided include all those who have ever been diagnosed with dlbcl, regardless of whether they have 
 been cured or not. most national registries report prevalence on nhl, and the sponsor used the recent 
 publication by kanas and colleagues on the dlbcl to nhl ratio to derive the prevalence (kanas et al., 
 2022). 
 indirect method 
 the sponsor indicated that previously published studies examining the prevalence of dlbcl are 
 limited, however, prevalence could be retrieved from a nhl estimate. hence, to supplement the direct 
 estimates, the sponsor has derived dlbcl prevalence by using a recently published incidence estimate 
 in combination with disease duration. 
 using data from the ecis, the 2020 crude incidence of nhl in the eu27 was 1.94 per 10,000 persons. 
 the sponsor emphasised that the reported percentage of nhl cases that are dlbcl varies in the 
 literature. according to dotlic and colleagues, dlbcl frequency in nhl was more common in south-
 eastern europe (39%) than in western europe (28.3%) (dotlic et al., 2015). while most of the 
 publications found report that around 30% of all nhl cases in europe are dlbcl (perry et al., 2016; 
 thandra et al., 2021), smith and colleagues reported that dlbcl constitutes 47.8% of all nhl cases 
 (smith et al., 2015). a recently published article by kanas and colleagues estimated the distribution of 
 nhl subtypes using data from the peer-reviewed literature and reported that the weighted average for 
 dlbcl across the eu was 34.2% (out of total nhl cases) (kanas et al., 2022). given the percentage of 
 dlbcl among all nhl cases reported in the literature varied, the sponsor calculated a range of dlbcl 
 incidence estimates based on the lowest (28.3%) and highest (47.8%) reported values. the estimated 
 incidence of dlbcl thus ranged from 0.549 (1.94 x 28.3%) to 0.927 (1.94 x 47.8%) per 10,000 
 persons in the eu. 
 concerning the estimate for the disease duration, the sponsor proposed to use a conservative 5-year 
 duration of the condition for the calculation of the prevalence estimate based on certain assumptions. 
 it was noted that more than 50% of dlbcl patients with complete remission after first-line soc 
 treatment with r-chop will be considered cured 2 years after diagnosis (habermann et al., 2006; 
 jakobsen et al., 2017; maurer et al., 2014; pfreundschuh et al., 2011) and that these patients should 
 not be included in the disease duration calculation after this point. the remaining patients will either be 
 refractory to first-line treatment or have a relapse after initial response. according to published real-
 world studies that were reviewed, the 5-year os for patients with r/r dlbcl is less than 50% (rovira 
 et al., 2015; abu sabaa et al., 2021; vardhana et al., 2017). among patients with relapse, the 
 majority will manifest within 2 years of diagnosis (79%) (harrysson et al., 2021). recent approvals of 
 polatuzumab vedotin (polivy) or car-t cell therapies have not been reported to have had a clinically 
 relevant effect on os (sermer et al., 2020, tilly et al., 2022). based on the above-mentioned, the 
 sponsor concluded that the maximum duration of dlbcl is 5 years. 
 using the standard formula p=i*d, both the low and high estimates for the dlbcl incidence, and a 
 conservative 5-year duration of the condition for the calculation, the updated prevalence of dlbcl was 
 estimated to span between 2.8 (0.549 x 5 years) and 4.6 (0.927 x 5 years) per 10,000 persons in the 
 eu. no sensitivity analysis was conducted as requested because the sponsor used the highest reported</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000076832</p><p> 
 page 11/18</p><p>dlbcl to nhl ratio found in the literature for the estimate and a conservative duration of the disease, and therefore considered the upper bound as an overestimate. 
 based on the review of the epidemiological data sources found, the sponsor concluded on a revised 5-
 year prevalence estimate for dlbcl of</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 per 10,000</header><p>persons in the eu. the proposed estimate was based on a disease duration of maximum 5 years for the whole dlbcl population, which is considered 
 rather low, and the highest reported proportion of dlbcl among nhl cases in europe of 47.8% (smith 
 et al., 2015). the comp has recently accepted a 10-year disease duration for dlbcl and agreed that a 
 10-year partial prevalence is appropriate to use in the prevalence estimate to reflect the impact of 
 improved survival of dlbcl patients in recent years. furthermore, the proportion of dlbcl among all 
 nhl cases reported by smith and colleagues, which was used for the revised estimate, seemed to be 
 rather high as most of the publications found reported that dlbcl constitutes around 30-35% of all 
 nhl cases in europe. 
 the revised estimate is slightly higher than those accepted in recent designations for dlbcl seen 
 recently where it has been concluded that the condition is affecting around 4-4.3 per 10,000 people in 
 the european community. in one of the latest orphan maintenance procedures seen where an average 
 10-year prevalence estimate for dlbcl was provided, a prevalence of</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 per 10,000</header><p> persons in the eu was concluded based on more current publications and updated registries (ema/od/0000074173). 
 the latter estimate is in line with the 10-year prevalence reported by nordcan and was therefore 
 considered for this maintenance procedure as well based on current knowledge of the comp. 
 the comp concluded that a prevalence of</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 in 10,000</header><p> persons in the community was within the range proposed by the sponsor and agreed to recommend maintaining the orphan designation.</p></section><section><header>article 3(1)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
 those affected by the condition. 
 existing methods</header><p>the sponsor referred to the latest european society for medical oncology (esmo) clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of dlbcl, which describe some of the treatment 
 strategies available to these patients in europe and outlined the current standard of care (soc) in the 
 first- and second-line setting based on european and american treatment guidelines as summarised 
 below (tilly et al., 2015; nccn 2021). the sponsor has also provided an extensive list of existing 
 treatment regimens used for dlbcl and focused on the approved therapies for dlbcl, including the 
 more recently approved products that have been authorised in the eu after 2015 and are therefore not 
 included in the current esmo guidelines. 
 the standard-of-care therapy for dlbcl involves multi-agent chemotherapy with complimentary 
 mechanisms of action combined with immunotherapy. up to 6-8 cycles of r-chop (the anti-cd20-
 directed monoclonal antibody rituximab + chop [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
 prednisolone]) which is administered every 21 days (chop-21) or chop-like chemotherapy are 
 considered to be the soc for patients with previously untreated dlbcl. roughly 20-40% of the 
 patients ultimately relapse to r-chop, and approximately 10-15% are refractory to r-chop as first-
 line therapy (i.e., have primary refractory disease) (chaganti et al., 2016; green et al., 2012). the 
 cd79b targeted antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin was also recently granted a new 
 indication in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (r-chp) for</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 medicinal products and standard of care used as second-line therapy 
 yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel; hereinafter referred to as axi-cel) was approved in the eu 
 (procedure no. emea/h/c/004480) on 23-aug-2018 and is authorised for the treatment of adult 
 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) dlbcl who have received two or more lines of systemic 
 therapy. this indication extension of yescarta is intended to include treatment of adult patients with 
 dlbcl and hgbl in the second line setting who are refractory to or have relapsed early after first line 
 chemoimmunotherapy. an overview of soc treatments and medicinal products authorised within the 
 eu for r/r dlbcl and nhl (table 1), and whether they are considered relevant for a discussion on the 
 significant benefit of axi-cel (yescarta) in second-line r/r dlbcl and hgbl is presented below. 
 in patients progressing or relapsing after first-line treatment, the ultimate treatment goal is autologous 
 sct (asct) for those who are eligible. this is a potentially curative treatment, significantly improving 
 the disease-free survival and os. however, asct requires high doses of chemotherapy, and is 
 therefore not an option for vulnerable elderly patients or patients with co-morbidities. only 50% of 
 relapsed patients can proceed to asct, mostly due to insufficient response to salvage chemotherapy or 
 stem cell collection failure (gisselbrecht et al., 2010; kondo et al., 2016; van den neste et al., 2016), 
 and it cannot therefore be considered a satisfactory method for the entire patient population for which 
 yescarta is intended to treat in second line. 
 according to the esmo guidelines, recommendations for patients who are not eligible for transplant in 
 first relapse mainly include platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based regimens or recruitment to clinical 
 trials with novel drugs. none of the medicinal products recommended by the esmo guidelines is 
 specifically approved as a second-line treatment for patients with dlbcl (including hgbl), but rather 
 for broader indications such as for the treatment of nhl and malignant lymphomas. these medicines 
 include bendamustine, bleomycin, carmustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, 
 etoposide, iphosphamide, lomustine, melphalan, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, vincristine, vindesine, 
 dexamethasone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. since the approved therapeutic indications for 
 these products are very broad, they completely overlap with the indication extension of yescarta and 
 therefore are considered satisfactory methods of treatment relevant for a discussion on the significant 
 benefit of axi-cel in r/r dlbcl and hgbl.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 available treatments for the target patient population in the second line setting. 
 the primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of axi-cel in the concerned extension of indication 
 are obtained from an ongoing, randomized, open label, multicenter phase 3 study called zuma-7 (also 
 known as kte-c19-107). the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of axi-cel versus 
 standard of care therapy (soct) in subjects with r/r lbcl, including dlbcl and hgbl disease 
 subtypes. subjects with r/r lbcl whose tumours progressed after first line rituximab and anthracycline 
 based chemotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axi-cel (n=180) or soct (n=179; i.e., 
 salvage chemotherapy followed by high dose chemotherapy [hdct] and asct). randomization was 
 stratified by response to first line therapy (primary refractory, relapse ≤ 6 months of first line therapy, 
 or relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first line therapy) and second-line age adjusted international 
 prognostic index (saaipi) (0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening. subjects 
 randomized to the axi-cel arm of the study underwent leukapheresis, optional steroid bridging therapy, 
 and lymphodepleting chemotherapy, followed by a single iv infusion of axi-cel at a recommended 
 target dose of 2 × 10
 6 anti-cd19 car-t cells/kg. for patients weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2 × 10
 8 anti-cd19 car-t cells was administered. for subjects randomized to the soct arm, treatment consisted of a protocol-defined, platinum-based salvage chemotherapy regimen 
 as selected by the treating investigator. subjects who responded to salvage chemotherapy and were 
 deemed eligible for transplant proceeded to hdct and asct, whereas subjects not responding to 
 salvage chemotherapy could receive additional treatment off protocol. 
 as of the data cut off (dco) date of 18-mar-2021 for the primary analysis of zuma-7, 170 subjects 
 were treated with axi-cel and 168 subjects had received at least 1 dose of salvage chemotherapy in 
 the soct arm. it is noted that most patients in the soct arm of zuma-7 received rituximab in 
 combination with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (r-ice; 84 of 168 patients [50%]), followed 
 by rituximab plus gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin/carboplatin (r-gdp; 42 of 168 patients 
 [25%]), rituximab combined with either cisplatin, dexamethasone, and high-dose cytarabine, or 
 dexamethasone, cytarabine, and oxaliplatin (r-dhap/ r-dhax; 37 of 168 patients [22%]), and 
 rituximab plus etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin (r-eshap; 5 of 168 patients 
 [3%]). these platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based regimens are commonly used in the second line 
 setting and considered as satisfactory methods since at least one or two of the products used as part 
 of these regimens are approved for the treatment of the target patient population for the concerned 
 indication extension of yescarta. 
 the primary objective of zuma-7 is to determine whether axi-cel is superior to soct, as measured by 
 efs determined by blinded central assessment. the primary endpoint of efs is defined as the time 
 from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per lugano 2014 classification response 
 criteria (cheson et al., 2014) as determined by blinded central assessment, commencement of new 
 lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause. efs is an established time-to-event endpoint and is 
 correlated with os in dlbcl (maurer et al., 2014). 
 overall, baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the two treatment arms. as 
 categorized by the investigator, the most common disease type for subjects in both the axi-cel and 
 soct arms were dlbcl, nos (110 of 180 subjects [61%] and 116 of 179 subjects [65%], 
 respectively), hgbl with or without myc and bcl2 and/or bcl6 rearrangement (43 of 180 subjects 
 [24%] and 27 of 179 subjects [15%], respectively), and large cell transformation from fl (19 of 180 
 subjects [11%] and 27 of 179 subjects [15%], respectively). forty-four subjects (24%) in the axi-cel</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000076832</p><p> 
 page 15/18</p><p>arm and 35 subjects (20%) in the soct arm had double-expressor lymphoma as reported by the investigator. 
 the data from the primary analysis of zuma-7 (dco: 18-mar-2021) demonstrated that for adult 
 subjects with r/r lbcl, including subjects with dlbcl and hgbl subtypes, the risk of an efs event was 
 significantly reduced with axi-cel treatment compared with soct (stratified hr: 0.398 [95% ci: 0.308, 
 0.514]; stratified log-rank p &lt; 0.0001). the efs rate at 2 years was 2.5 times higher in the axi-cel 
 arm compared with the soct arm, with a 6.3-month (i.e., 4.15-fold) improvement in median efs 
 time. efs results showed hrs favouring axi-cel over soct across most subgroups, including subjects 
 with hgbl or double-expressor lymphoma, primary refractory or early relapsed disease, high or low 
 saaipi score, and all age groups including patients ≥ 65 years of age (figure 1). trends for subgroup 
 analyses of efs per randomization stratification factors (response to first-line therapy and saaipi and 
 high-risk groups (hgbl) and age were similar to those observed for efs per central assessment of 
 response.</p></section><section><header>figure 1.</header><p>forest plot of efs by subgroups per central assessment (fas)</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 notes: efs is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per lugano 
 classification {cheson 2014}, commencement of new lymphoma therapy (including stem cell transplant in the 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel arm without axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced response or retreatment of axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel), or death from any cause. the stratification factors are response to first-line therapy (primary refractory 
 versus relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy versus relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and/or 
 second-line age-adjusted international prognostic index (0 to 1 versus 2 to 3) as collected via ixrs. stratified cox 
 regression models are used to provide the estimated hr and 2-sided 95% cis for axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to 
 soct. the breslow method is used to handle the ties for the cox regression models. disease type of “other” 
 includes t cell/histiocyte rich large b cell lymphoma, ebv + dlbcl, primary cutaneous dlbcl (leg type), and other 
 types. hgbl – double hit is defined as presence of myc and either bcl2 or bcl6 rearrangements; hgbl - triple hit 
 is defined as presence of bcl2, bcl6, and myc rearrangements; double-expressor lymphoma is defined as 
 overexpression of myc and bcl2 proteins not related to underlying chromosomal rearrangements. in subgroup for 
 central lab molecular as unclassified, the number of subjects and/or number of events are sparse across 
 stratification factors between the treatment arms and resulted in estimated hr &lt; 0.00001.

 page 17/18</p><p>the observed benefit of axi-cel in terms of the primary endpoint efs was supported by the secondary endpoints. a statistically significant improvement in orr was demonstrated with orr rates of 83% in 
 the axi-cel arm and 50% in the soct arm. given that objective response is a prerequisite to reach 
 hdct and subsequent asct, the orr translates into at least 50% of patients in the soct arm not 
 being able to reach definitive therapy. the complete response (cr) rate was 2-fold higher in the axi-cel 
 arm compared with the soct arm (65% versus 32%). the zuma-7 interim os results suggested a 
 trend favouring axi-cel (median os had not been reached) over soct (median os of 35.1 months). 
 the median os observed in the soct arm should be considered in the context of subsequent 
 therapies. although there was no planned crossover between treatment arms, 56% of patients in the 
 soct arm received subsequent cellular immunotherapy after soct (i.e., treatment switching rate). 
 sensitivity analyses of os that were pre-specified to account for the treatment switching rate were 
 consistent with the os results in the fas and supported the positive trend of the os benefit shown 
 with axi-cel over soct.</p><p>the clinical data derived from zuma-7 demonstrate the capacity of axi-cel to prolong efs and support
