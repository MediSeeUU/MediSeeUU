 grounds for the comp opinion at the designation stage</header><p>the comp opinion on the orphan medicinal product designation was based on the following grounds: • the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric antigen receptor 
 was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing anti-cancer activity in patients 
 with refractory disease; 
 • the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening with 5-year survival 
 rates reported as low as approximately one in four patients for the high risk group; 
 • the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.4 in 10,000 persons in the european union, at the time the application was made.</p><p>• although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
 product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 
 cd28/cd3 zeta chimeric antigen receptor may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
 condition. the sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data showing a favourable response in 
 patients with progressive disease who are refractory to previous treatments. the committee 
 considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.</p></section><section><header n="1.2">1.2.

 article 3(1)(a) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the community when the 
 application is made 
 condition</header><p>diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) represents the most common subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl), accounting for 30% to 40% of all newly diagnosed cases. it has an unknown 
 aetiology. a family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
 infection, hepatitis c virus (hcv) seropositivity, a high body mass as a young adult and some 
 occupational exposures have been identified as risk factors of dlbcl. (annals of oncology 26 
 (supplement 5): v116–v125, 2015) 
 dlbcl occurs in adult patients, with a median age in the seventh decade, but the age range is broad, 
 and it may also occur in children. clinical presentation and prognosis are variable, depending mainly of 
 the extranodal site when they arise. these malignancies present in localised manner in approximately 
 20% of patients. disseminated extranodal disease is less frequent, and one third of patients have 
 systemic symptoms (critical reviews in oncology/hematology 87 (2013) 146–171).</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/511556/2018</p><p>
 page 6/15</p><p>
 the 2016 revision of the world health organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms (swerdlow et al, blood 2016 127:2375-2390) makes additions to the dlbcl entity. in particular, dlbcl-nos (with 
 two further subtypes added compared to the previous 2008 version, germinal center b-cell type, and 
 activated b-cell type), primary dlbcl of the cns, primary cutaneous dlbcl, ebv+dlbcl nos (new 
 modification), hhv8+dlbcl nos (new addition), dlbcl associated with chronic inflammation, t-cell 
 histiocytic rich large b cell lymphoma are all listed in the new classification.</p><p>
 the therapeutic indication refers to “the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse 
 large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl)” it is acknowledged that the therapeutic indication falls entirely within 
 the granted orphan designation “treatment of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma”.</p></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat</header><p>further to the chmp opinion the intention to treat the orphan condition was considered justified.</p><p>please see epar - scientific discussion.</p></section><section><header>chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature</header><p>the applicant has not identified any change in the seriousness of the condition, and referred to a study by mounier and co-workers (lancet haematol. 2015 nov;2(11):e481-91). in europe, the 5-year overall 
 survival is around 60% (haematologica march 2017 102: 584-592).</p><p>
 the comp acknowledged that the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or 
 multiple nodal or extra nodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-
 threatening with 5-year survival rates reported as low as 26% for the high risk patients. although the 
 overall cure rate of dlbcl is 60-70%, about 30-40% of patients relapse and 10% have refractory 
 disease.</p></section><section><header>number of people affected or at risk</header><p>for the number of people affected by the condition, an upwards-revised estimate for a point prevalence of 4.5 per 10,000 was proposed. this was calculated in three steps:</p><p>
 1.</p><p>crude incidence of all non-hodgkin lymphomas as appearing in the european cancer 
 information system (ecis) portal, which is then:</p><p>
 2.</p><p>corrected by applying a 47.8% rate to account for dlbcl (as per smith et al br j cancer. 2015 
 apr 28;112(9):1575-84), and</p><p>
 3.</p><p>finally multiplied by 5 years which is assumed to be a measure for the duration of the 
 condition. the latter duration appears to be based on a 46.3% 5-year survival rate (again per 
 the smith paper, br j cancer. 2015 apr 28;112(9):1575-84).</p><p>
 the comp acknowledged the estimate but also considered that the highest prevalence figure cited in 
 the smith paper was 4.55/10,000 (citing a 10-year partial prevalence in the range of 41.1–45.5) and 
 an approximately 4.6 per 10.000 figure was considered for the purpose of maintenance.</p></section><section><header>article 3(1)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
 those affected by the condition.</header><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/511556/2018</p><p>
 page 7/15</p></section><section><header>existing methods</header><p>several medicinal products are authorised for broader indications such as non-hodgkin lymphomas, and the comp has previously considered them satisfactory in the treatment of dlbcl and should be 
 considered for the purpose of significant benefit. these include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, 
 bendamustine, bleomycin, vincristine, vindesine, etoposide, iphosphamide, chlorabucil, lomustine, 
 prednisone, and prednisolone. previously the comp has also considered rituximab, docetaxel, 
 mitoxantrone, methotrexate, epirubicin, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and pixantrone. 
 esmo guidelines exist for the treatment of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (tilly et al. ann oncol (2015) 
 26 (suppl 5): v116-v125). specifically for the relapsed refractory settings, which is the focus of this 
 orphan maintenance procedure the following recommendations stand: 
 • in patients aged &lt;65–70 years with good performance status and no major organ dysfunction, salvage regimens with rituximab and chemotherapy followed, in responsive patients, by hdc and 
 asct, are recommended. salvage regimens such as r-dhap (rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, 
 dexamethasone) or r-ice (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) appear to have similar 
 outcomes. r-gdp (rituximab, cisplatin, gemcitabine, dexamethasone) is also recommended in the 
 esmo guidelines. beam (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan) is the most commonly 
 used high-dose regimen.</p><p>
 • patients not suitable for high-dose therapy may be treated with the same or other salvage regimens as r-gemox (rituximab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin). pixantrone, is also discussed in these 
 guidelines as an option in heavily pre-treated patients.</p></section><section><header>table 1.</header><p>r/r recommendations from tilly et al. ann oncol (2015) 26 s5.</p></section><section><header>significant benefit</header><p>to address the issue of significant benefit in dlbcl, the applicant drew from the observations of the pivotal zuma-1 study and historical scholar-1 study, separated the observations pertaining 
 specifically to dlbcl patients, discussed the received treatments and performed indirect comparisons 
 of the results versus the existing products.</p><p>
 the pivotal study was kte-c19-101 (zuma-1). zuma-1 enrolled subjects with refractory aggressive 
 nhl (dlbcl, pmbcl, and transformed follicular lymphoma) across multiple study centres.</p><p> phase 1 
 enrolled 7 subjects and identified a tolerable regimen for further study in phase 2.</p><p>phase 2 comprises</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/511556/2018</p><p>
 page 8/15</p><p>
 of 3 cohorts: cohorts 1 and cohort 2 have completed enrolment and cohort 3 is currently enrolling subjects. most subjects had stage iii or iv disease and were refractory to second- or greater-line 
 therapy; nearly half had international prognostic index (ipi) scores of 3 or 4.</p><p>the outcomes for all 
 enrolled patients can be summarised as follows (detailed results can be found in the yescarta epar): 
 the primary endpoint (superiority of orr compared to a historic control orr of 20%) was met in phase 
 2 for cohort 1 at the second interim analysis and subsequently in cohorts 1 and 2 combined. 
 additionally, orr among all 101 subjects treated in phase 2 was 83% (95% ci: 74%, 90%), with a cr 
 rate of 58%. the orr among all 101 subjects based on central review was 72% (95% ci: 62%, 81%), 
 with a cr rate of 51%, respectively. orr in all 111 enrolled patients in cohorts 1 and 2 was 77% 
 (95% ci: 69%, 85%) with a cr rate of 55% per local investigator and 66% (95% ci: 56%, 75%) with 
 a cr rate 47% per central reviewer. with regards to the controls used, scholar-1 was a patient 
 pooled, retrospective analysis, which integrated data from 2 randomized phase 3 studies (lysarc-
 coral and canadian cancer trials group ly.12) and 2 observational databases (md anderson cancer 
 center and mayo clinic/university of iowa specialized program of research excellence [spore]) of 
 patients with refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl), primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma 
 (pmbcl), and transformed follicular lymphoma (tfl), with refractory defined as progressive disease 
 (pd) or stable disease (sd) &lt; 6 months as best response to last line of chemotherapy (
 ≥ 4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapse 
 ≤ 12 months after autologous stem cell transplantation (asct). 
 specifically for the demonstration of significant benefit in dlbcl, the sponsor presents data from zum-
 1 in patients with dlbcl and noted an orr of 84% versus 26% in the control study. all subjects with dlbcl in scholar-1 received an anthracycline containing regimen and an anti-cd20 agent during 
 first line therapy, while second line regimens consisted of platinum agents with an anti-cd20 agent 
 and were predominantly comprised of ice, dhap, or gdp. in zuma-1, dlbcl patients were required to 
 have received prior treatment with an anthracycline regimen and an anti-cd20, and the majority 
 received a platinum-containing second line therapy.</p><p>this comparison is depicted in the table below:</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 a minimum follow-up of 12 months with median follow up of 15.1 months.</p><p>it was also pointed out that the response rates in the pivotal trial compared favourably to pixantrone 
 monotherapy (orr of 40%) in heavily pretreated r/r aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas (pettengel 
 et al. leukemia &amp; lymphoma, may 2012; 53(5): 836–841), and that there are no options specifically 
 recommended after 2
 nd relapse in the esmo guidelines. overall the comp considered that the sponsor has provided clinical data showing responses in patients 
 with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, which compare favourably to responses with 
 existing treatments in historical controls. the comp considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
 advantage.</p></section><section><header n="1.3">1.3.  
 comp position adopted on 19 july 2018</header><p>the comp concluded that:</p><p>• the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the designated orphan medicinal product; 
 • the prevalence of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
 european union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
 • the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening with 5-year survival rates reported as low as approximately 25% for high risk patients; 
 • although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the assumption that yescarta may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
 orphan condition still holds. the sponsor has provided clinical data showing responses in patients 
 with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, which compare favourably to responses 
 with existing treatments in historical controls. the comp considers that this constitutes a clinically 
 relevant advantage. 
 the comp, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of article 
 5(12)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
 • the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; • the criteria for designation as set out in article 3(1)(b) are satisfied.</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 includes the proposed condition in the list of mature b cell neoplasms. 
 pmbcl is regarded as unique b-cell lymphoma that is thought to arise from a putative thymic medulla 
 b cell. it constitutes 2–4% of non-hodgkin lymphomas and occurs most frequently in young females 
 (martelli 2014, expert review of hematology, 8:2, 173-186).</p><p>the tumour is often bulky, and 
 symptoms are related to the mediastinal mass, frequently with superior vena cava syndrome. spread

 current therapies. as with dlbcl, pmbcl is an aggressive lymphoma and if left untreated, results in 
 survival of weeks to months (cultrera and dalia 2012).</p><p>patients with pmbcl often present with a 
 bulky tumour in the anterior mediastinum that is rapidly progressive and gives rise to local 
 compressive symptoms, including early dyspnoea, cough, dysphagia and compromising the airway or 
 great vessels, producing a superior vena cava syndrome. 
 in line with the initial designation application, it was accepted that the condition is life-threatening due

 as per the esmo guidelines (vitolo et al, annals of oncology, volume 27, issue suppl_5, 1 september 
 2016, pages v91–v102), the combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine 
 and prednisolone (r-chop) or with vacop-b (etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
 prednisolone and bleomycin)/macop-b (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,

 regimens such as da-epoch-r (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab) are the current standard treatments.</p><p>
 consolidative mediastinal rt is recommended in responding patients treated with standard-dose 
 chemoimmunotherapy (r-chop/r-v/macop-b). hdct followed by asct is not recommended in 
 patients who achieved complete remission, but in young patients who do not obtain an adequate 
 response, an intensification therapy with hdct/asct is recommended (vitolo et al, annals of 
 oncology, volume 27, issue suppl_5, 1 september 2016, pages v91–v102). 
 in particular for relapsed/refractory pmbcls, esmo guidelines note that salvage treatment strategies 
 of similar to nodal dlbcls and include attempting reinduction with non-cross-resistant agents followed 
 by consolidation with hdct/asct in patients with chemosensitive disease.</p></section><section><header>significant benefit</header><p>to address the issue of significant benefit in pmbcl, similarly to what was done for dlbcl, the applicant drew from the observations of the pivotal zuma-1 study and historical scholar-1 study,</p><p>
 separated the observations pertaining specifically to pmbcl patients, discussed the received 
 treatments and performed indirect comparisons of the results versus the existing products.</p><p>
 the sponsor clarified that all pmbcl subjects in scholar-1 received first line therapy containing an 
 anthracycline and an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody and received 2nd or later line therapy consisting 
 of r-dhap (6 subjects), r-gdp (2 subjects), r-gemox followed by r-dhap (1 subject) and r-ice 
 followed by r-dhap (1 subject).</p><p>these regimens are consistent with the subjects with pmbcl enrolled 
 into zuma-1 in the subjects with pmbcl treated in zuma-1 phase 2, 6 out of 8 subjects (75%) 
 responded, all of whom were complete responders, and median overall survival for these subjects has 
 not been reached. across all outcome measures, data are generally consistent with outcomes of zuma-
 1 subjects with dlbcl. this compares to a response rate of 20% in the 10 pmbcl subjects in 
 scholar-1 (none of whom achieved complete response). median overall survival was 7.7 months for 
 pmbcl subjects in scholar-1. the following table describes the responses for pmbcl.</p></section><section><header>table 3.</header><p>responses in pmbcl patients</p></section><section><header>zuma-1 (n= 8)

 during the oral explanation further indirect comparisons between the above results were discussed. it 
 was also pointed out that the response rates in the pivotal trial compared favourably to pixantrone 
 monotherapy (orr of 40%) in heavily pretreated r/r aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas (pettengel 
 et al. leukemia &amp; lymphoma, may 2012; 53(5): 836–841), and that there are no options specifically 
 recommended after 2nd relapse in the esmo guidelines, similarly to what was discussed for dlbcl 
 (see corresponding section above).</p><p>orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 overall the committee considered that the sponsor has provided clinical data showing responses in patients with relapsed or refractory pmbcl, which compare favourably to responses with existing 
 treatments in historical controls. the comp considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
 advantage.</p></section><section><header n="2.3">2.3.  
 comp position adopted on 19 july 2018</header><p>the comp concluded that:</p><p>• the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the designated orphan medicinal product; 
 • the prevalence of primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.5 
 in 10,000 persons in the european union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
 • the condition is life-threatening due to relapses in 20-30% of patients who have poor prognosis and chronically debilitating in particular due to superior vena cava syndrome, night sweats, fever 
 and weight loss; 
 • although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the assumption that yescarta may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
 orphan condition still holds. the sponsor has provided clinical data showing responses in patients 
 with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma, which compare favourably 
 to responses with existing treatments in historical controls. the comp considers that this 
 constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
 the comp, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of article 
 5(12)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
 • the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; • the criteria for designation as set out in article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. the committee for orphan medicinal products has recommended that yescarta, autologous t cells 
 transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor, 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel, eu/3/15/1553 for treatment of primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma is 
 not removed from the community register of orphan medicinal products.</p></section></body></xml>
