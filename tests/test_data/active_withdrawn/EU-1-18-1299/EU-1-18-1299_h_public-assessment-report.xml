 submission of the dossier</header><p>the applicant kite pharma eu b.v. submitted on 29 july 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to the european medicines agency (ema) for yescarta, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
 article 3(1) and point 1 of annex of regulation (ec) no 726/2004.</p><p>
 yescarta was designated as an orphan medicinal product eu/3/14/1393 on 16 december 2014 in the 
 following condition: diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) 
 yescarta was designated as an orphan medicinal product eu/ 3/15/1553 on 09 october 2015 in the 
 following condition: primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl) 
 yescarta was designated as an orphan medicinal product eu/3/15/1579 on 11 november 2015 in the 
 following condition: follicular lymphoma (fl) 
 yescarta was granted eligibility to prime on 26 may 2016 in the following indication: treatment of adult 
 patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) who have not responded to their prior therapy, or have 
 had disease progression after autologous stem cell transplant (asct). 
 eligibility to prime was granted at the time in view of the following: 
 • dlbcl is a chronically debilitating and life-threatening condition. refractory/relapsed dlbcl is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with a median survival of around 6 months and new treatment options 
 would be welcomed. 
 • although limited, the available nonclinical data supported the pharmacological rationale.</p><p>• from a clinical perspective, limited but promising results have been provided with 5 responders out of 7 patients at month 1 in the zuma-1 study and 63% orr in patients with dlbcl or pmbcl in the nci 
 study. 
 • despite many uncertainties, kte-c19 (yescarta) could bring a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies and consequently be of major public health interest. 
 the applicant applied for the following indication: 
 yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large b-cell 
 lymphoma (dlbcl), primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl), and transformed follicular lymphoma 
 (tfl) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (asct). clinical experience indicates a significant 
 improvement in overall response rate, including durable complete response (no evidence of disease), durable 
 partial response, and survival compared to historical outcomes. 
 following the chmp positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the committee for orphan medicinal 
 products (comp) reviewed the designation of yescarta as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
 indication. more information on the comp’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance assessment 
 report published under the ‘assessment history’ tab on the agency’s website: ema.europa.eu/find 
 medicine/human medicines/european public assessment reports.

 disease or condition</header><p>non–hodgkin’s lymphomas (nhl) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders originating in b-lymphocytes, t-lymphocytes or natural killer (nk) cells. nk/t-cell lymphomas are very rare. more than 60 
 specific nhl subtypes have been identified and assigned names by the world health organization (who). 
 nhl subtypes are categorized by the characteristics of the lymphoma cells, including their appearance, the 
 presence of proteins on the surface of the cells and their genetic features. 
 aggressive lymphomas account for about 60 percent of all nhl cases. diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) 
 is the most common aggressive nhl subtype. primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbl) is a subtype of 
 large b-cell lymphoma</p><p>that is putatively derived from a thymic b cell. its clinical and molecular 
 characteristics are distinct from other subtypes of dlbcl and, in fact, closely resemble those of nodular 
 sclerosing hodgkin lymphoma (nshl). transformation of follicular lymphoma (fl) is a morphological 
 diagnosis based on the demonstration of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) in a patient who has been 
 diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma, either consecutively or concurrently.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology</header><p>data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program of the national cancer institute (seer) showed that nhl is the most prevalent haematological malignancy and is the seventh most common new 
 cancer among men and women, accounting for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of cancer-related deaths</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 13/127 
 (howlader et al, 2015). for 2016, seer estimated 72580 new cases of nhl and 20150 deaths due to nhl in the united states (howlader et al, 2015).</p><p>
 dlbcl is the most common type of nhl, accounting for 30–40% of all cases. dlbcl accounts for 
 approximately 31% of all nhls in western countries and 37% of b-cell tumours worldwide. the median age 
 at presentation is 70 years old; however, it can occur at any age, with a slightly higher incidence in men. the 
 incidence rate of dlbcl was 3.44/100000 in the european union (eu) in 2014 (rarecarenet 2017). the 
 probability of having dlbcl increases with age, from 0.13% and 0.09% before the age of 29 to 1.77% and 
 1.4% after the age of 70 in men and women, respectively. for the vast majority of patients, the aetiology of 
 dlbcl is unknown. factors thought to potentially confer increased risk include immunosuppression (including 
 aids, and iatrogenic aetiologies in the setting of transplantation or autoimmune diseases), ultraviolet 
 radiation, pesticides, hair dyes, and diet. a subset of diffuse large b cell lymphoma, including immunoblastic 
 and primary cns disease is highly associated with the ebv virus, although unlike certain indolent histologies, 
 the concept of antigen-driven lymphomagenesis is less developed in dlbcl.pmbcl constitutes approximately 
 2 % to 4 % of all non-hodgkin lymphomas (around 6 % of diffuse large b-cell lymphomas (dlbcl). this 
 disease affects mainly young adults (median age of 35), predominantly women (female/male ratio 1.7-2/1). 
 there are also cases of pmbcl among children and adolescents. no risk factors for this type of lymphoma 
 have been identified.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis</header><p>initially, the classification of non-hodgkin lymphoma was based on morphology, but advances in immunology and molecular medicine allowed the introduction of a biological classification for these diseases. dlbcl arises 
 from mature b-cells at different stages of differentiation. several gene mutations promote changes in b-cells, 
 changing the gene expression and promoting a neoplastic transformation. during b lymphocyte ontogeny, 
 after leaving the bone marrow, those cells travel to secondary lymphoid tissues where they will find their 
 respective antigens promoting the development of secondary follicles. an antigen-dependent phase of b-cell 
 development occurs at this site. in the germinal center of the secondary follicle, these lymphocytes are 
 transformed into centroblasts that have a high rate of proliferation, while frequent and continuous somatic 
 mutations of genes of the immunoglobulin variable chain occur, promoting maturation and differentiation into 
 centrocytes and subsequently into plasma cells or in memory b-cells. multiple lesions involving molecular 
 pathways of b-cell proliferation and differentiation may result in the activation of oncogenes such as the 
 bcl2, bcl6, and myc genes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes such as p53 and ink4, as well 
 as other important transcription factors such as oct-1 and oct-2. 
 the human cd19 antigen is a 95 kd transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin 
 superfamily. cd19 is classified as a type i transmembrane protein, with a single transmembrane domain, a 
 cytoplasmic c-terminus, and extracellular n-terminus. cd19 is a biomarker for normal and neoplastic b cells, 
 as well as follicular dendritic cells. cd19 is critically involved in establishing intrinsic b cell signaling 
 thresholds through modulating both b cell receptor-dependent and independent signalling. cd19 functions as 
 the dominant signalling component of a multimolecular complex on the surface of mature b cells, alongside 
 complement receptor cd21, and the tetraspanin membrane protein cd81 (tapa-1), as well as cd225.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.

 infiltrate tissues or obstruct organs. pain in an enlarged lymph node or organ may be noted if the lymphomatous mass enlarges rapidly. as with other types of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl), diffuse large cell 
 lymphomas can present with b-symptoms, including fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. 
 generalized pruritus may also be present. 
 other symptoms can include the following: anorexia, pedal oedema (caused by extensive pelvic 
 lymphadenopathy), fatigue, discomfort or shortness of breath (caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy). 
 the diagnosis of dlbcl should be carried out in a reference haematopathology laboratory with expertise in 
 morphological interpretation and the facilities to carry out the full range of phenotypic and molecular 
 investigations. 
 a surgical excision biopsy remains the optimal method of diagnosis. this allows assessment of nodal 
 architecture and provides adequate material for phenotypic and molecular studies. ideally, the biopsy should 
 be sent unfixed to the laboratory to allow flow cytometric studies to be carried out and high-quality dna and 
 rna to be extracted.</p><p>
 dlbcl shows an aggressive behaviour with a median survival of less than 1 year in untreated patients.</p><p>
 follicular lymphoma that transformed to diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) portend a poor prognosis for 
 most patients, with a median overall survival (os) of 1 to 2 years. 
 outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive b-cell nhl are poor. only 10% of patients with 
 relapsed/refractory disease will have long-term survival, and long-term benefit is generally limited to patients 
 with chemotherapy-sensitive disease who achieve a response to second line platinum-based therapy and are 
 able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (asct).</p><p>patients with refractory disease, defined as no 
 response to last line of therapy or early relapse after asct, have low response rates to subsequent therapy 
 and short overall survival (os). published reports have demonstrated response rates ranging from 0% to 
 23%, and in 1 study, median os was less than 10 months for such patients (philip et al, 1995; moskowitz et 
 al, 1999; ardeshna et al, 2005; seshadri et al, 2008; hitz et al, 2010; telio et al, 2012; matasar et al, 2013).</p><p>
 similarly poor outcomes are observed for patients who have relapsed disease, but are ineligible for asct for 
 a variety of reasons, such as inadequate response to second line therapy, relapse after second or greater line 
 of therapy, failure to mobilize stem cells, or presence of comorbidities (crump et al, 2004; feugier et al, 
 2005; colosia et al, 2014; van den neste e et al, 2016).</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header><p>the current standard of care for first-line treatment for aggressive b-cell nhl is a regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (chop) in combination with an anti-cd20 
 monoclonal antibody (mab) such as rituximab (flowers et al, 2010). although more effective than 
 chemotherapy alone, first-line r-chop only results in long term disease remission in &lt; 40% of subjects. 
 thus, patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive b-cell dlbcl and pmbcl may comprise 60% or more of 
 all subjects with aggressive b-cell nhl. 
 patients with relapsed or refractory dlbcl and pmbcl typically are treated with a rituximab and platinum-
 based chemotherapy regimen, followed by asct for those who are eligible (philip et al, 1995; nccn, 2014; 
 tilly et al, 2015).</p><p>however, studies in relapsed/refractory b-cell nhl indicate that only half of patients who 
 respond to second-line therapy are able to proceed to asct (philip et al, 1995; moskowitz et al, 1999; 
 gisselbrecht et al, 2012; crump et al, 2014). thus, only a small fraction of patients with relapse/refractory</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 disease benefit from asct.</p><p>friedberg and colleagues have estimated that only 10% of all patients with relapsed/refractory disease will have long term survival following asct in the rituximab era (friedberg, 
 2011).</p><p>outcomes are particularly poor for patients who have primary refractory disease after first-line 
 therapies with or without rituximab; further, most of these patients are not eligible for transplant due to their 
 chemotherapy resistant disease. published objective response rates (orrs) to second-line chemotherapy in 
 patients with refractory disease range from 0 to 23% (philip et al, 1995; josting et al, 2000; ardeshna et al, 
 2005; telio et al, 2012; matasar et al, 2013; hitz et al, 2015), and primary refractory disease was found to 
 be a significant risk factor for failing second-line therapy (moskowitz et al, 1999).</p><p>outcomes are also poor for 
 subjects with aggressive b-cell nhl that is refractory to second-line therapy (orr of 18%) (seshadri et al, 
 2008) or third-line therapy (orr of 14%) (ardeshna et al, 2005) . 
 most patients with pmbcl will initially respond to therapy with a rapid decrease in the tumour mass, but rapid 
 disease progression during treatment cycles is not uncommon. second-line treatment strategies are like 
 those used for dlbcl, attempting re-induction with non-cross-resistant agents, followed by consolidation 
 with hdt-asct in those with a chemo-sensitive disease. in general, the outcomes of these patients have 
 been disappointing (sehn et al, 1998; kuruvilla et al, 2008). the broad use of rituximab in first-line therapy 
 has made recurrence less frequent, but harder to manage successfully (gisselbrecht et al, 2010).</p><p>further, as 
 described in section 3.4, an analysis by the sponsor shows that historically, outcomes for patients 
 relapsed/refractory aggressive nhl are similar, regardless of disease subtype. 
 early relapse after asct, defined as relapse occurring ≤ 12 months after asct, has been found to be an 
 adverse prognostic factor for survival in patients with aggressive b-cell nhl.</p><p>in an analysis of data from the 
 parma trial, the orr to subsequent therapy was 40% for those with an early relapse and 69% for those with 
 relapse more than 12 months after asct (p &lt; 0.0001), and 8-year overall survival (os) rates were 13% and 
 29% (p &lt; 0.0001) for the 2 subsets (guglielmi et al, 1998). similarly, in the collaborative trial in relapsed 
 aggressive lymphoma (coral), 4-year event-free survival for patients who had early relapse after asct was 
 significantly lower than that of subjects who relapsed more than 12 months after asct (46% v 56%; p &lt; 
 0.05) (gisselbrecht et al, 2012).</p><p>similarly, nagle and colleagues (nagle et al, 2013), reported a significantly 
 shorter median os for patients who had early relapse after asct than for those who relapsed ≥ 12 months 
 after asct (8.2 vs. 26.7 month; p = 0.01). 
 poor outcomes also are observed for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive b-cell nhl who respond to 
 salvage therapy, but are ineligible for transplant based on one or more factors, such as age &gt; 65 years, 
 inadequate response or early relapse after salvage therapy, relapse after second or greater line of therapy, 
 failure to mobilize stem cells for asct, or presence of comorbidities or unresolved toxicities.</p><p>a review of 
 small, single-arm studies showed a median os ranged from 4 to 13 months for patients with transplant-
 ineligible relapsed/refractory dlbcl (colosia et al, 2014). in the coral trial, 129 of 193 patients who 
 received third-line therapy, but did not undergo subsequent transplant (transplant ineligible), had worse 
 survival than patients who underwent asct or allogeneic sct (34/193 subjects):</p><p>median survival was 3.3 
 months vs 11.1 months, respectively, and 2-year os was 9.3% vs. 33.9%, respectively (van den neste e et 
 al, 2016). in the groupe d’etude des lymphomes de l’adulte lnh98-5 study of elderly patients with dlbcl, 
 77 of 202 patients treated with r-chop as first-line therapy experienced a relapse and did not undergo 
 transplant; 2-year os for this group was 26% (feugier et al, 2005).</p><p>in a national cancer institute of canada 
 clinical trials group (ncic-ctg) phase 2 study of second-line therapy, 17 elderly patients who were not 
 considered eligible for transplant had a median survival of 8.9 months (crump et al, 2004).</p><p>although the 
 coral study included a small group of patients who underwent asct or allogeneic sct without achieving a 
 response to third-line therapy, national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) guidelines (nccn, 2014) and 
 european society for medical oncology (esmo) guidelines (tilly et al, 2012) suggest that patients who</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 16/127 
 relapse after second-line therapy are unlikely to respond to subsequent therapy and therefore generally are not eligible for asct. 
 according to current esmo guidelines, clinical trials with novel drugs remain acceptable treatment options for 
 subjects with relapsed/refractory dlbcl or pmbcl who are ineligible for asct due to chemo-refractory 
 disease or other causes (tilly et al, 2015; vitolo et al, 2016). treatment of relapsed/refractory tfl is not 
 addressed in either the 2015 or 2016 esmo guidelines, as treatment would proceed according to the 
 transformed phenotype (in this case, dlbcl) (wagner-johnston et al, 2015). 
 thus, the data from the literature indicate that under the current treatment paradigm, where virtually all 
 patients will receive rituximab and an anthracycline as first-line therapy, those who are refractory to any line 
 of therapy, those who are not eligible to proceed to transplant after relapse, and those who relapse early 
 after transplant have uniformly low survival rates and no curative options. 
 collectively, patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive b-cell nhl who are ineligible for asct have no 
 curative options. no therapies are approved in this setting, and both national comprehensive cancer network 
 (nccn) and european society medical oncology (esmo) guidelines indicate that there is a clear unmet 
 medical need that warrants novel treatment strategies for these patients (nccn, 2014; tilly et al, 2015; 
 vitolo et al, 2016).</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>axicabtagene ciloleucel is an engineered autologous t-cell immunotherapy product whereby a patient’s own t cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral transduction using an mscv-based retroviral 
 vector to express a car comprising an anti-cd19 single chain variable fragment (scfv) linked to cd28 and 
 cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains. cd19 is expressed as a surface antigen in dlbcl and other aggressive b-
 cell lymphomas. the transduced anti-cd19 car t cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back into the 
 patient, where they can recognize and eliminate cd19 expressing target cells. 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel binds to cd19 expressing cancer cells and normal b cells. following anti-cd19 car t 
 cell engagement with cd19 expressing target cells, the cd28 and cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate 
 downstream signalling cascades that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions 
 and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and 
 necrosis of cd19 expressing target cells. 
 the indication of the marketing authorisation application (maa) for yescarta was initially proposed for the 
 treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl), primary 
 mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl), and transformed follicular lymphoma (tfl) who are ineligible for 
 autologous stem cell transplant (asct). 
 the indication agreed at the cat is for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
 b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic 
 therapy.</p><p>
 yescarta is intended, for autologous use only.</p><p>
 a single dose of yescarta contains 2 × 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (or maximum of 2 × 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 ml suspension in an infusion bag.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 pmbcl and tfl patients ineligible for asct. in this regard, the use of the proposed targeted cell therapy was 
 considered to be a major therapeutic innovation. 
 however, during assessment the cat concluded that it was no longer appropriate to maintain the accelerated 
 assessment procedure as the evaluation of the dossier was no longer compatible with the previously agreed 
 timetable. the reason for this is attributable to the adoption of a substantial list of questions, including major

 express the gibbon ape leukemia virus (galv) envelope and the moloney murine leukemia virus (momlv) 
 gag-pol proteins. 
 stable, retroviral transfer of the pg13-cd19 transfer vector and subsequent selection of the cell clone pg13-
 cd19-h3 were conducted at the national cancer institute (nci, bethesda, maryland, us). as the vector has 
 the full 3’ltrs (and is no sin-vector) the proviral dna will have two functional ltrs, and due to cellular co-
 expression of the momlv gag-pol and the galv envelope, vector particles are produced and constitutively 
 released into the supernatant. both cell banks are established under good manufacturing practices (gmp). 
 overall the testing strategy and characterisation of the cell banks is considered adequate. the genetic

 characterisation of pg13-cd19-h3 vector impurities was performed to evaluate process consistency among 
 pg13-cd19-h3 vector lots. specific components were evaluated in detail. 
 impurities identified were host cell protein, hc-dna, bsa and p30 protein. each harvest of pg13-cd19-h3

 mycoplasma, 
 in vitro virus and replication competent retrovirus (rcr) are performed only on material in the last harvest from the production campaign. the last harvest is considered a worst-case condition, and testing 
 at this stage assures that the entire production campaign remains free of adventitious agents and that

 in vitro assay and for replication competent viruses (rcr). all pg13-cd19-h3 vector lots tested to date have been negative for 
 adventitious viruses and rcr. study reports on the vector harvest testing were provided. in addition, the

 description of the product and pharmaceutical development</header><p>yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel final product) consists of autologous t cells that have been genetically modified 
 ex vivo to express a chimeric antigen receptor to target cd19 on the cell surface of malignant b cells. the active substance of yescarta, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is composed of a patient’s t cells that have 
 undergone 
 ex vivo t-cell activation, gene transfer by replication-deficient retroviral vector (pg13-cd19-h3 vector), and expansion. these transduced t cells are then formulated in a cryopreservation medium suitable 
 for infusion. each final product bag of yescarta is filled to deliver a target dose of 1.0 x 10
 6 to 2.0 x 106 car positive viable t cells/kg of patient weight. yescarta is supplied cryopreserved at a temperature of ≤ -150°c 
 in cryostorage bags. the cryostorage bag contains a nominal volume of 68 ml of formulated axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel final product. the composition of yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel final product) consists of anti-
 cd19 car-t cells formulated with cryostor cs10, sodium chloride and human albumin.</p><p>
 the active substance of yescarta comprises cd3-positive t cells that have been transduced with an anti-
 cd19 car using a retroviral vector. the product may also contain a small percentage of autologous natural 
 killer (nk) cells or cells with a phenotypic characteristic of nk t cells. b cells, monocytes and other white 
 blood cells are present at very low levels.</p><p>
 excipients used for the production of finished product are 0,9% sodium chloride injection which provides, 
 albumin (human) which is a stabiliser and</p><p>cryostor cs10 agent.</p><p>
 a series of development studies were conducted to determine the optimal conditions for cryopreservation of 
 yescarta.</p><p>
 it was agreed that cryostor is not regarded as a novel excipient. 
 the primary container closure system intended for distribution of yescarta is cryostore, commercially 
 available, ce-marked ethylene vinyl acetate (eva) cryostorage bag specifically designed for storage of blood 
 and blood components. 
 the suitability of the primary container closure system has been shown based on results from extractable and 
 leachable testing, container closure integrity testing, and long-term and accelerated stability studies. 
 the secondary packaging for yescarta is an aluminium cassette, designed to protect the product during 
 storage, shipment, and handling.</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product and process controls</header><p>information regarding the manufacturer of yescarta is provided. the entire manufacturing process is covered by respective gmp certificates.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 virus safety 
 due to the nature of the product, the manufacturing process of the pg13-cd19-h3 vector and of the yescarta 
 finished product does not contain any step that removes or inactivates viruses. in addition, the final finished 
 product is not tested for adventitious viruses. control of adventitious agents is mainly based on selection and 
 testing of starting materials and raw materials of biological origin and testing of the retroviral vector. in order 
 to ensure safety of the product, procedural controls are followed for acceptance of material used in the 
 manufacture of pg13-cd19-h3 vector and axicabtagene ciloleucel. these controls are as follows:</p><p>
 1.</p><p>safety testing of the pg13-cd19-car-h3 master cell bank and pg13-cd19-car-h3 working cell bank</p><p>

 studies in animals were not performed by the applicant due to the lack of a relevant animal model. instead, 
 evaluation of potential on-target/off-tumour activity has been included into a non-glp primary pharmacology 
 study using anti-murine cd19 car t cells as a surrogate for studies of the human anti-cd19 car t cell 
 product.

 clp-2.0 process were submitted.</p><p>

 primary pharmacodynamic studies</header></section><section><header>comparability between nci and kite products</header><p>the manufacturing process of the cd19 car t cells from patients with melanoma (clp-1.0) differed from the manufacturing process of the cd19 car t cells patients with advanced b-cell haematologic malignancies 
 (clp-2.0). differences were as follows: in clp-2.0, t cells were stimulated, transduced and expanded in 
 closed bags using serum-free media and harvested after 6 to 8 days in culture, then cryopreserved prior to 
 use. the clp-2.0 process is similar to the clp-2.2 process used for kte-c19, but clp-2.2</p><p>
 the comparability of anti-cd19 car t-cell product manufactured by the clp-1.0 process and the clp-2.0 
 process was demonstrated through split apheresis studies at nci, which showed a lower transduction 
 efficiency of the clp-2.0 process as compared to the clp-1.0 process (37.1 ± 6.1% compared with 78.4 ± 
 5.4%, respectively), while total cell numbers, fold expansion, the inf-γ release upon co-culture with cd19
 + target cells, and the phenotypic evaluation was similar. products prepared by the clp-2.0 process (nci) and the clp-2.2 process (kite) were compared directly using split apheresis products from 4 subjects. these 
 studies demonstrated statistically equivalent transduction efficiency for the nci clp-2.0 product and kte-

 with cd19+ target cells) and cell growth profiles.</p></section><section><header>cd19 expression profile summary</header><p>targeting b-lineage haematologic malignancies via cd19 is based on earlier findings demonstrating that expression of cd19 is restricted to cells, both normal and malignant, of the b-lineage. early publications by 
 nadler and colleagues (nadler et al, 1983; anderson et al, 1984) showed that cd19 protein is expressed on 
 all b-lineage lymphoid cells, from the pro-b-cell maturation stage to naïve and differentiated b cells. uckun 
 and colleagues (uckun et al, 1988) confirmed and extended these findings by demonstrating that leukemic 
 progenitor b cells also express cd19, and that erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytoid, and multilineage normal 
 bone marrow progenitor cells do not express cd19. more recently, johnson and colleagues (johnson et al, 
 2009) showed that primary lymphoma cells from patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) 
 expressed cd19, whereas reference t cells did not. olejniczak and colleagues (olejniczak et al, 2006) 
 examined the expression pattern and levels of cd19 in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph node 
 tissue from patients with 6 different common b-cell malignancies (cll, small lymphocytic lymphoma [sll], 
 b-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia [all], hairy cell leukemia [hcl], dlbcl, and follicular lymphoma 
 [fl]). nearly all samples within each type were considered positive for cd19. expression levels of cd19 were 
 variable across the different b-cell malignancies, but all b-cell malignancies examined showed consistently 
 measurable levels of cd19 expression above reference cd3
 + t cells. in summary, evidence from key published literature demonstrates that cd19 is expressed on the surface of normal b-lineage cells as well as 
 most b-cell malignancies, including dlbcl and fl, two subtypes of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). other 
 investigators have shown that cd19 is also expressed in primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl) 
 (rodriguez et al, 1994) and mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) (leonard et al, 2001).</p></section><section><header>in vitro</header><p>characterization of human anti-cd19 car t cells initial in vitro characterization studies were performed using anti-cd19 car-transduced t cells, generated using t cells from patients with melanoma. the anti-cd19 car-transduced t cells were generated at nci 
 using the clp-1.0 process.</p><p>the specificity and potency of the anti-cd19 car t cells were evaluated by measuring their ability to produce 
 ifn-γ in response to co-culture with either cd19
 + or cd19- target cells. for each experiment, transduced t cells were cultured overnight with target cells and ifn-γ secreted into the media was measured using an 
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results showed that production of cytokines by anti-cd19 car 
 t cells was dependent on both the presence of the anti-cd19 car t cells and the co-culture with cd19
 + target cells. for control cultures containing either transduced or nontransduced t cells co-cultured with cd19- target cells or no target cells, only minimal cytokine production was observed.</p><p>the characteristics and specificity of the t cells transduced with the anti-cd19 car construct were further 
 assessed by comparing phenotype, scfv expression and cytokine induction using k562 cells (a cell line 
 derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia) engineered to express either cd19 or, as a negative 
 control, the low affinity human nerve growth factor receptor (cd19-k562 and ngfr-k562, respectively). 
 results from these experiments demonstrated that cd3
 + t cells expressed the anti-cd19 car and both cd3
 +cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ cells produced ifn-γ in a car- and cd19-specific manner. the percentage of cd3+</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 t cells (cd4+ and cd8+) that produced ifn-γ in response to a cd19+ target (54%) was generally consistent with the percentage of cd3
 + t cells that expressed the fmc63 scfv (ie, 45%, the transduction efficiency). biological activity of the anti-cd19 car t cells was also tested in a cytotoxicity assay. control t cells were 
 transduced with a car construct (sp6-28z), analogous to fmc6328-z, but specific for hapten 2, 4, 6-
 trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. results demonstrated that t cells transduced with fmc63-28z killed primary cll 
 cells in a dose-dependent and cd19-specific manner, while the t cells transduced with sp6-28z did not.</p></section><section><header>figure 1 cytotoxicity of anti-cd19 car t cells</header><p>additional characterization studies were performed to analyze the composition (percent transduction and phenotype), specificity, and biological activity of autologous anti-cd19 car t cells derived from 15 subjects 
 with advanced nhl enrolled in nci protocol 09-c-0082 investigating anti-cd19 car t cells for the treatment 
 of patients with advanced b-cell haematologic malignancies. the anti-cd19 car-transduced t cells were 
 generated at nci using the clp-2.0 process.</p><p> product composition was determined by immunophenotypic analysis of surface markers (cd3, cd4, cd8 and 
 cd45ra) by flow cytometry. the markers ccr7 and cd45ra are broadly utilized to distinguish between 
 naïve (ccr7
 +cd45ra+), central memory (ccr7+cd45ra-), effector memory (ccr7-cd45ra-) and effector (ccr7
 -cd45ra+) human t-cell subsets. phenotyping assays showed that the anti-cd19 car t cells derived from these subjects with advanced nhl comprised both cd3
 +cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t cells. furthermore, the transduced t cells primarily comprised central memory t cells (t
 cm) and effector memory t cells (tem), as defined by ccr7/cd45ra surface expression.</p><p> 
 specificity, potency, and poly-functionality of the anti-cd19 car t cells derived from the 15 subjects with 
 advanced nhl were further evaluated utilizing luminex
 tm to measure cytokines produced during co-culture with cd19-k562 or ngfr-k562 (negative control) target cell lines. a panel of 17 different cytokines, 
 chemokines, and effector molecules with various immunomodulatory roles was measured in co-cultures of 
 anti-cd19 car t cells and target cells.</p><p>
 the 17 analytes comprised the following: il-2 as a marker of immune cell homeostasis and proliferation; il-
 6, il-13, tumour necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) 
 as markers of pro-inflammatory activity; il-4, il-5, il-10, ifn-γ, and soluble cd137 as markers of immune-</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 modulating activity; macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1α and mip-1β as chemokines; and granzyme a, granzyme b, soluble fas ligand (sfasl), soluble fas (receptor for sfasl), and perforin as effector 
 molecules. all subject-derived anti-cd19 car t-cell products produced ifn-γ when incubated with cd19-
 k562 target cells, consistent with the 
 in vitro data (kochenderfer et al, 2009). induction of all 17 analytes occurred in a cd19-dependent manner. these data demonstrate that anti-cd19 car t-cell products 
 generated from multiple donors all exhibit cd19-dependent activation, and the capacity to produce diverse 
 biological factors in response to car stimulation. 
 characterization of an anti-murine cd19 car construct analogous to kte-c19 
 since the anti-cd19 scfv utilized for kte-c19 does only recognize human cd19, a murine surrogate was 
 engineered for non-clinical proof-of-concept studies in immune competent mice. this surrogate model used 
 an anti-murine cd19 car construct that was similar to kte-c19 with the exception of the scfv, which has 
 been derived from the 1d3 mab recognizing murine cd19. murine t cells were transduced with the anti-
 murine cd19 car construct and adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice challenged with a cd19-
 expressing 38c13 lymphoma cell line to investigate the anti-lymphoma effect of the anti-murine cd19 car t 
 cells.</p><p>
 in addition, the surrogate murine cd19 car t cells were investigated 
 in vitro for cd19-specific activation by measuring inf-γ release in co-cultures of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells and cd19
 + and cd19- target cells. thereby, the anti-murine cd19 car t cells also revealed some basal activity in the presence of cd19
 - cells as well as in the absence of any target cells. the basal activity became evident by a ~30-50 fold increase in ifn-γ release when comparing transduced t cells with untransduced cells in the control situations. 
 irrespective of this basal activity, a significant increase of secreted ifn-γ was still observed, when the cd19 
 car t cells were co-cultured with cd19
 + target cells. a similar basal activity was not observed with the anti-human cd19 car t cells.</p></section><section><header>in vivo</header><p>studies using a murine model of lymphoma and anti-murine cd19 car t cells</p><p>the administration of the anti-murine cd19 car t cells into the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model revealed both the ability of the cd19 car t cells to prevent establishment of a lymphoma and to eradicate already

 both the prophylactic and the therapeutic setting resulted in prolonged survival of the mice while control 
 animals became rapidly moribund due to lymphoma and were euthanized. using the syngeneic mouse 
 lymphoma model, the applicant also investigated the influence of total body irradiation (tbi) prior to the 
 administration of the lymphoma cells and the cd19 car t cells which revealed the importance of the tbi-
 induced lymphodepletion for prolonged survival of these animals and thus for a successful outcome of the

 ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>the environmental risk assessment was performed in accordance with annex ii to directive 2001/18/ec on the deliberate release into environment of genetically modified organisms (gmos) and following the

 in accordance with article 6 of regulation (ec) no 726/2004, national competent authorities established 
 under directive 2001/18/ec have been consulted. 
 the era included as part of the submission of the maa discusses the environmental risk assessment for the 
 clinical use of yescarta. potential risks for the environment associated with the clinical use of yescarta are 
 generation and transmission of replication competent retroviruses (rcrs), transmission of residual infectious 
 retroviral vector particles, or transmission of genetically modified t-cells. since either the likelihood of these 
 risks or the potential hazards have been evaluated to be negligible, the overall environmental risk has also 
 been concluded as negligible. this conclusion has been supported during the consultation process.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.6">2.3.6.  
 discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>non-clinical in vitro pharmacology studies were performed with cd19 car t cells that were generated using two previous manufacturing processes established at the nci (clp-1.0 and clp-2.0); neither of them 
 represents the current process (clp-2.2). it was agreed in the context of scientific advice that the non-
 clinical data generated with cd19 car t cells manufactured at nci do not need to be repeated with cd19 
 car t cells manufactured using the current clp-2.2 process provided that comparability and equivalent 
 performance of the products derived from the different manufacturing processes can be demonstrated. data 
 from split apheresis studies performed at nci were provided that compared the clp-1.0 and the clp-2.0 
 processes. although these data revealed a lower transduction rate of the clp-2.0 process (37.1 ± 6.1%) as 
 compared to the clp-1.0 process (78.4 ± 5.4%), the specific activity against cd19
 + target cells was not impaired as demonstrated by a comparable ifn-γ release upon co-culturing of car t cells and cd19
 + target cells. since the percentage distribution of naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector t cell 
 subsets was comparable in both cd19 car t cell products. although the potential reason for the lack of 
 correlation between transduction efficiency and ifn-γ release when comparing cd19 car t cells 
 manufactured with both processes was not clarified, it is not considered necessary to repeat the non-clinical 
 in vitro data with kte-c19 manufactured using the current clp-2.2 process, since from a non-clinical point of view, comparability and/or equivalent performance has been sufficiently demonstrated between the products 
 derived from the different processes. moreover, ifn-γ release and cytotoxicity are also evaluated during 
 manufacturing of kte-c19 either for release of the final product (ifn-γ secretion) or during characterization 
 studies (cytotoxicity). 
 overall, the provided non-clinical 
 in vitro data sufficiently demonstrate specific activity of kte-c19 against its target antigen cd19. in addition, the immunophenotypic analysis of the anti-human cd19 car t cells 
 suggests that both transduced cd4
 + and cd8+ t cells are present in the final product. percentage distributions of naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector t cell subsets varied between different 
 donors. moreover, the luminex
 tm analysis demonstrated that all 17 tested analytes were specifically released by the cd19 car t cells when co-cultured with cd19
 + target cells suggesting a certain poly-functionality of</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 34/127 
 the car t cells at the end of the manufacturing process. although these data are rather considered as characterization data of the final product than non-clinical pharmacology data, they are still important as they 
 support the versatile capability of kte-c19 with regard to lymphocyte activation, proliferation, trafficking and 
 effector mechanisms.</p><p> 
 in addition to the 
 in vitro evaluation of kte-c19, a murine surrogate cd19 car t cells was established for in vivo</p><p>evaluation in a syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. this approach provided important proof-of-concept for the overall design of the chosen cd19 car construct including for example the choice of the co-
 stimulatory domain. such a surrogate model may also be considered as the most appropriate non-clinical 
 model for investigating the persistence of the cd19 car t cells and for evaluating potential on-target/off-
 tumour effects of the car t cells. on the other hand, it is evident that crucial parameters of the car t cell 
 may differ between the murine surrogate cd19 car t cells and the human cd19 car t cells. this includes 
 for example the binding affinity of the scfv, the manufacturing of the transduced cells, the composition of t 
 cell subsets, and the basal t cell activity which was observed in the murine surrogate only. despite these 
 expected differences, the use of murine surrogate cd19 car t cells in immunocompetent mice instead of 
 testing kte-c19 in immunocompromised mice is an acceptable approach that overcomes some of the 
 limitations of the 
 in vivo</p><p>testing of kte-c19 in immunocompromised animals, such as unspecific xenogeneic immune responses of kte-c19 in mice or the lack of complex interactions of the car t cells with other 
 components of the immune system. since both models do have clear, although differing, limitations with 
 regard to the translation of the non-clinical pharmacology data to human, additional non-clinical 
 in vivo pharmacology data (e.g. testing of kte-c19 in immunocompromised animals transplanted with human cd19+ tumour cells) would not add significant value to the available non-clinical and clinical pharmacology data sets. the provided non-clinical pharmacokinetic investigations focused on the 
 in vivo persistence of the murine surrogate car t cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, which is acceptable for this type of product. 
 the chosen model provides all necessary stimuli that are considered important for a specific activation, 
 expansion, and survival of the cd19 car t cells (e.g. cd19
 + target tumour cells, endogenous cytokines, chemokines and cellular interactions of a fully functional immune system).</p><p>despite these ideal preconditions, 
 the anti-murine cd19 car t cells could only be detected in spleen at day 8, but no longer at day 63 post-
 infusion (kochenderfer et al., 2010a) probably car t cells may have persisted in tissues such as bone 
 marrow, but remained undetectable by the method used; or despite limited persistence, car t cell 
 engraftment was sufficient to eradicate lymphoma and induce long-lasting b-cell aplasia during the 
 observation period in the animal model. 
 yescarta comprises engineered human t-cells, therefore there are no representative 
 in vitro assays, ex vivo</p><p>models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the human product. hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed. 
 instead the on-target/off-tumour effect on normal b cells was confirmed during the pharmacology studies in 
 the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. this effect on normal b cells was expected based on the expression 
 pattern of cd19 and resulting b cell aplasia has been observed in both the syngeneic mouse lymphoma 
 model and in study participants that were treated with kte-c19 in clinical trials. other toxic effects of anti-
 murine cd19 car t cells were not evident in the mouse lymphoma model. however, off-target toxicities are 
 also not expected to be reliably detected in the surrogate mouse model, since off-target recognition of other 
 antigens may differ between the anti-human and anti-murine cd19 car t cells due to the different scfvs 
 that were used in the cd19 car constructs. similarly, the use of kte-c19 in immunocompromised mice 
 would also not be expected to reliably predict off-target effects, since potential differences of cross-
 recognition of unrelated antigens, differences of antigen expression patterns, and differences in the 
 in vivo</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 35/127 
 survival, activation and expansion of kte-c19 are expected to hamper detection of potential off-target effects in such a model. 
 in addition to the potential toxicities of the cd19 car t cells that are either dependent on the expression 
 pattern of the chosen target antigen (on-target/off-tumour toxicities) or on the cross-reactivity of the chosen 
 scfv with other non-target antigens (off-target toxicities), there are also expected risk that are associated 
 with the general mode of action of car t cells, such as uncontrolled t cell proliferation, tumour lysis 
 syndrome (trs), cytokine release syndrome (crs) and macrophage activation syndrome (mas). these toxic 
 effects cannot be investigated in non-clinical studies as they are general effects of car t cells and the extent 
 of expected toxicities are largely based on patient-specific parameters such as the individual tumour load.</p><p>
 no studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of yescarta on fertility, reproduction and 
 development. this is acceptable based on the type of product, the expression pattern of the target antigen 
 and the lack of a relevant animal model. the risk of inadvertent germline transmission of the cd19 car 
 construct has not been addressed; however, the</p><p>guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline 
 transmission of gene transfer vectors (emea/273974/2005)</p><p>indicates that the risk of germline transmission 
 associated with the administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal 
 testing of human cells may be difficult or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human 
 genetically modified cells are not recommended.</p><p>
 it is not known if yescarta has the potential to be transferred to the foetus.</p><p>based on the mechanism of 
 action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including b-cell 
 lymphocytopenia.</p><p>therefore, yescarta is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for women of 
 childbearing potential not using contraception.</p><p>pregnant women should be advised on the potential risks to 
 the foetus.</p><p>assessment of immunoglobulin levels and b-cells in newborns of mothers treated with yescarta 
 should be considered. it is unknown whether it is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding 
 child.</p><p>breast-feeding women should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.</p><p>
 no carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with yescarta. the combination of both the 
 use of a γ-retroviral vector with full-length viral ltrs and the high proliferative potential of the transduced t 
 cells provides a certain risk of insertional oncogenesis which has previously been addressed in a scientific 
 advice procedure. literature data reported an exceptionally high resistance of mature mouse t cells against 
 transformation induced by genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors. moreover, there were no reported 
 cases of insertional oncogenesis (see clinical safety) of either kte-c19 itself or t cells that were transduced 
 with γ-retroviral vectors encoding other transgenes – and that is reassuring.</p><p>the experience so far with 
 mouse and human t cells suggests that t cell transformation due to genomic integration of γ-retroviral 
 vectors is, if at all, a very rare event. 
 no formal pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted. kte-c19 comprises human 
 autologous cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing an anti-cd19 car. as such, appropriate in 
 vitro and in vivo models to assess potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions do not exist. cyp enzymes 
 and other classically described metabolic pathways are not involved in the metabolism of cellular therapy. 
 potential risks for the environment associated with the clinical use of yescarta are generation and 
 transmission of replication competent retroviruses (rcrs), transmission of residual infectious retroviral vector 
 particles, or transmission of genetically modified t-cells. from the environmental risk assessment it is 
 concluded that these risks are negligible.

 nci 09-c-0082: 
 the 13 subjects from this study comprise a group similar to the zuma-1 population with respect to disease 
 characteristics (refractory dlbcl, pmbcl, or tfl), conditioning chemotherapy regimen received (low dose), 
 anti-cd19 car t-cell characteristics (cryopreserved cells manufactured with the</p><p>

 anti-cd19 construct), and target dose (2 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg for all subjects in zuma-1 and 6/7 subjects in nci 09-c-0082).</p><p>
 pharmacokinetics of anti-cd19 car t cells were assessed by means of measuring the presence, expansion, 
 and persistence of anti-cd19 car t cells at approximately 7 days (+/-3), 14 days (+/-3), 4 weeks (± 2 
 weeks), 3 months (± 1 month), and 6 months (± 1 month) after cell infusion.</p><p>
 serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
 (qpcr) test using a method developed at the nci (kochenderfer et al, 2015). the absolute number of 
 persisting anti-cd19 car t cells per microliter (μl) of blood was based on the percentage of anti-cd19 car-
 expressing cells in the product as determined by flow cytometry (see supplemental methods of publications 
 by kochenderfer and colleagues [kochenderfer et al, 2012; kochenderfer et al, 2015]), with normalization to 
 expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin and to the absolute number of mononuclear blood cells to 
 derive a final value of car positive cells/μl of blood.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 in the cohorts 11-14 with cryopreserved car-t cells used, all 13 evaluable subjects had measurable anti-cd19 car t-cells in blood at day 7 and/or day 14. across all subjects, the median values at days 7, 14, and 
 28 were 33 cells/μl, 13 cells/μl, and 1 cell/μl, respectively. the median peak value across all subjects 
 (cmax) was 86 cells/μl (range: 6 to 294 cells/μl). due to the small sample size no correlation with efficacy 
 and safety variables was conducted.</p></section><section><header>zuma-1 phase 1/2:</header><p>anti-cd19 car t-cell levels were measured in the blood of subjects enrolled in phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2 combined. the presence, expansion, and persistence of anti-cd19 car t cells were monitored in blood by 
 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) analysis at various time points before and after infusion of 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel. similarly, levels of circulating cytokines were assessed at multiple time points before 
 and after conditioning chemotherapy and infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. in addition, normal b-cell levels 
 were evaluated in blood by flow cytometry to monitor the on-target and off-tumour effect of anti-cd19 car t 
 cells. 
 results of the primary analysis showed that anti-cd19 car t cells were measurable in peripheral blood 
 within the first 14 days after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion in all evaluable subjects. anti-cd19 car t 
 cells exhibited an initial rapid expansion with a median time to peak level of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood of 
 8 days (range: 8.0 to 78.0 days, with one outlier) after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. the median peak 
 level across all subjects (maximum observed plasma concentration [cmax]) was 41.9 cells/μl (range: 0.8, 
 1513.7cells/μl). levels of anti-cd19 car t cells decreased toward background levels by 3 months of the 
 infusion (range: 0 to 15.8 cells/μl), but were measurable at the last assessment in most evaluable (i.e., 
 responding) patients. the median area under the blood concentration vs time curve (auc) from day 0 to day 
 28 (auc0-28) was 462.3 cells/μl days.

 cd19 car t cells in the blood (c

 (range 0-28.4 cells/μl) after yescarta infusion.</p></section><section><header>dose proportionality and time dependencies</header><p>the number of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood was positively associated with objective response including both cr and pr. subjects who had an objective response had higher levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of 
 anti-cd19 car t cells compared to non-responders. levels of anti-cd19 car t cells were not assessed after 
 disease progression, which limits the ability to correlate long-term cell persistence and dor. the median 
 peak anti-cd19 peak levels in responders (n=55) were 4 times higher than the corresponding level in non-
 responders (n= 28)(45.6 cells/μl vs 11.4 cells/μl). median auc levels in subjects with cr or pr were 5 times 
 higher than the corresponding level in non-responders (562.0 days*cells/µl vs. 103.3 days*cells/µl,). 
 higher peak levels of anti-cd19 car t-cell levels were found to be associated with the occurrence of 
 neurologic events, but not with crs.

 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>results from the nci 09-c-0082 and zuma-1 showed that peak levels of anti-cd19 car t cells occurred within the first 7-14 days after yescarta infusion. in the primary analysis of zuma-1 phase 2, he median 
 peak level of anti-cd19 car t cells in the blood (c
 max) were 41.9 cells/µl (range: 0.8 - 1513.7 cells/μl), which decreased to a median of 2.1 cells/µl by 1 month (range 0 - 167.4 cells/μl) and to a median of 0.4 
 cells/µl by 3 months (range 0 - 15.8 cells/μl) after yescarta infusion .</p><p> 
 the levels of anti-cd 19 declined by day 28 and declined to near background levels within 3 months.</p><p>
 the extent of t cell expansion does not appear to be related to the total dose of car-t cells with respect to 
 one patient within nci-09-c-0082 who received a higher dose (6 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t-cells/kg instead of 2 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car-t cells/kg). the number of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood was positively associated with objective response (cr or pr) 
 based on the central assessment and the 12-month update.</p><p>.</p><p>the median anti-cd19 car t cell c
 max levels in responders (n=73) were 205% higher compared to the corresponding level in nonresponders (n=23) (43.6 
 cells/μl vs 21.2 cells/μl).</p><p>median auc
 day 0 - 28 in responding patients (n=73) was 251% of the corresponding level in nonresponders (n=23) (557.1 days × cells/μl vs. 222.0 days × cells/μl).</p><p>
 patients who had co-medication with steroids (n=26) and tocilizumab (n=43) showed increased cmax and 
 auc-level. for the other covariates such as gender, age, race and tumour burden no significant impact on the 
 pharmacokinetics became evident.</p><p>
 several product characteristics of axicabtagene ciloleucel were studied in association with treatment 
 outcomes:</p><p>percent transduction, ex vivo ifn-γ production in a co-culture assay, as well as the percentage of 
 product t-cell subsets (based on ccr7, cd45ra, cd4, and cd8 expression determined by flow cytometry; 
 and total number of t cells or anti-cd19 car t cells infused). given a limited sample size and exploratory 
 nature of analyses, the results should be taken with caution, product characteristics did not appear to be 
 predictive of efficacy outcomes. as to safety, interestingly the provided data suggests that products which</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 46/127 
 contain increased numbers of more differentiated t cells (tcm, tem and teff) may be associated with higher probability of grade 3 or higher crs (see rmp). 
 in the nci study, four of the five crs had long-term durability with durations of remission of 56, 51, 44, and 
 38 months. crs continued after recovery of non-malignant polyclonal b cells in three of four patients with 
 long-term complete remissions without detectable levels of anti cd-19 car t-cells in the blood. 
 one subject in the study nci 09-c0082 with ongoing cr who received a dose of 1 x 10
 6 cells/kg had detectable anti-cd19 car-t cells at the last visit on day 125 while other subjects with ongoing crs had no 
 detectable anti-cd19 car t- cells in the blood.</p><p>
 the results in regard to temporary relationship between persistence of car-t cells and b-cell aplasia have 
 been provided for both nci and zuma-1 studies. a decline in the number of subjects with detectable anti-
 cd19 car t cells was associated with an increase in the number of subjects with detectable b cells over 
 time, indirectly indicating target engagement. starting from month 9, about 20% of subjects do not have 
 detectable car-t cells but experience b-cell recovery.</p><p>in addition, an increase over time was observed in a 
 subset of subjects who had undetectable anti-cd19 car t cells together with detectable b cells. notably, a 
 subset of subjects across all time points evaluated to date, had both detectable anti-cd19 car t cells and 
 detectable b cells, albeit at very low levels. no data in regard to functional characteristics of persisting anti-
 cd19 car-t cells are available to date.</p><p>
 demonstration of cd19 expression was not required for study eligibility, as the restricted expression of cd19 
 to both normal and most malignant b-cells to be well established by literature. the retrospective tissue 
 analysis revealed that 92 % of enrolled patients were cd19 positive. of note, 5/9 patients with a negative 
 ihc-signal were responder. reasons for potentially false-negative treatment results were degradation of 
 cd19-antigen over time and a lower detection cd19-detection level in heterogenous tumours compared to 
 homogenous, which are acknowledged. overall, there was no overt relationship between the dose of anti-
 cd19 car+ t cells and their expansion and persistence in the peripheral blood. likewise, to date, there was 
 no apparent relationship between the anti-cd19 car+ t cell dose, the anti-cd19 car+ t cell persistence in 
 the blood, and the clinical response or the toxicities related to this therapy, respectively. 
 the prophylactic use of systemic steroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the activity of yescarta 
 (see section 4.2. of the smpc). 
 the pharmacodynamics of zuma-1 phase 2 may support the median time to peak level of anti-car-t-cells in 
 blood after drug infusion. however, the comparative analysis between responder vs. non-responder showed, 
 that biomarker such as ifn-gamma or il-15 were not positively correlated with the treatment outcome, 
 neither for the depth nor for the duration of response. there is currently no evidence of a positive correlation 
 between certain biomarkers such as ifn-gamma and il-15 and a positive treatment outcome (see discussion 
 on clinical efficacy and rmp).</p></section><section><header n="2.4.5">2.4.5.

 the applicant has submitted one key phase ii study (zuma-1 phase 2), one retrospective global patient-level 
 pooled study (scholar-1), supportive phase i study (zuma-1 phase 1), and study nci-09-c-0082. since the 
 efficacy results of zuma-1 phase 2 are to be compared with the results of scholar-1, both studies are 
 considered as main studies and studies zuma-1 phase 1 and nci-09-c-0082 as supportive. 
 the current submission does not include subjects enrolled in phase 2 cohort 3 because enrollment into 
 cohort 3 was initiated in september 2016 and results from this cohort will be described separately.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.6">2.4.6.  
 dose response studies</header><p>nci 09-c-0082: dosing of the conditioning chemotherapy agents and yescarta was based on the results nci study 09-c-
 0082, a phase 1 open label study of the safety and feasibility of anti-cd 19 car t-cells in subjects with 
 advanced b-cell malignancies.</p><p>
 because previous studies have shown an association between adequate lymphodepletion and adoptively 
 transferred t
 -cell expansion and function in animal models, lymphodepletion was included for all subjects. the nci protocol underwent numerous amendments that altered the doses of conditioning chemotherapy 
 agents, post infusion il-2, and anti-cd19 car t-cells.</p><p>
 a total of 14 cohorts were enrolled. cohorts 1 through 10 used fresh cells. cohorts 1 through 9 used high 
 doses of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg for 2 days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2 for 5 days) as 
 conditioning chemotherapy and high doses of anti-cd19 car t-cells (3.0 × 10
 6 cells/kg to 3.0 × 107 cells/kg). cohorts 11-14 used cryopreserved cells. cohorts 11 and 12 were planned to use the same conditioning 
 chemotherapy as cohort 10; the target anti-cd19 car t-cell doses were increased to 2 x 10
 6 cells/kg and 6 x 10
 6 cells/kg, respectively, to assess the potential need for higher doses of the cryopreserved cell product. cohorts 13 and 14 explored a cyclophosphamide dose of 500 mg/m2 for 3 days, with the same doses of 
 fludarabine and anti-cd19 car t-cell as used in cohort 11. the subjects enrolled in cohorts 11, 12, 13, and 
 14 represent a group similar to study zuma-1 with respect to disease status and treatment. 
 zuma-1 phase 1 
 based on the response and safety observations described above for the nci study and the need to achieve 
 adequate lymphodepletion and therapeutic levels of anti-cd19 car t-cells without intolerable toxicity, the 
 zuma-1 study used a regimen of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 dose and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 given 
 concurrently for 3 days and a target yescarta dose of 2 × 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. for subjects weighing &gt; 100 kg, the yescarta dose was fixed to 2 x 10
 8 cells.</p><p>the phase 1 of zuma-1 planned for alternatively reducing conditioning chemotherapy regimens and yescarta 
 doses if the initial dosing was not well tolerated. the dlt definition in the kte-c19-101 study was applied to 
 the nci study (09-c-0082; ind 13871) data in group 3.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 seven subjects were treated in phase 1. six subjects were evaluable for toxicity per protocol, and 1 of the 6 subjects experienced dose-limiting toxicities (grade 4 encephalopathy on day 1 and grade 4 crs on day 6, 
 comprising acute kidney injury, left ventricular failure, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension). on day 16, the 
 subject developed grade 5 ae of intracranial haemorrhage.</p><p>
 additional safety precautions were adopted in the protocol following these events. the safety review team 
 considered the phase 1 regimen to be tolerable; therefore, the same doses of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine,

 analysis sets the protocol specified 2 analysis sets for phase i (safety phase), a dlt evaluable set (patients who received the target and were followed for at least 30 days 
 or patients who received a dose of anti-cd19 car+ t cells lower than the target for that cohort and experienced a dlt during the 30 day post-infusion period), and a 
 safety set (all subjects treated with any dose of kte-c19). for orr, a mitt set as defined for phase ii will be 
 used. 
 for phase ii, the protocol specified 3 analysis sets, i.e. 
 -</p><p>a modified intent to treat set (mitt) consisting of all subjects 
 enrolled and treated with kte-c19 at a dose of at least 1 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car+ t cells/kg -</p><p>a safety set consisting of all subjects treated with any dose of kte-c19 
 -</p><p>the full analysis set (fas) consisting of all enrolled (all leukapheresed) subjects (otherwise described 
 as itt). 
 the primary analysis of efficacy used the mitt set. the fas was used for sensitivity analyses.</p><p>
 methods for the primary endpoint the objective response rate with exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals was to be computed. for cohorts 1 and cohorts 1 and 2 combined, an exact binomial test was to be used to compare 
 the observed response rates to a response rate of 20%.</p><p>
 for the duration of response, a competing-risk analysis method (pepe 1991, fine and gray 1999) was to be 
 used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse. the cumulative incidence of relapse in the presence of 
 non-disease related mortality (the competing risk) will be estimated along with 2-sided 95% confidence 
 intervals at 3-month intervals. kaplan-meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be used 
 for pfs and os. landmark analyses at 3 months intervals were to be provided for survival endpoints. 
 multiplicity and timing of analyses alpha splitting according to song and chi (2007) and wang et al (2007) was defined in order to control the overall type 1 error at 0.025 (one-sided) for testing of cohort 1 and the combined cohorts 1+2. 
 consequently, a significance level of 0.022 was used for cohort 1, and 0.0075 for cohorts 1+2. in order to 
 control the type 1 error maximum patient numbers per cohort were conservatively assumed. in cohort 1, two 
 interim analyses were planned. one interim analysis for futility was planned after 20 subjects with 3 months 
 follow-up data in the mitt set. a second interim analysis for efficacy was planned after 50 subjects with 3 
 months follow-up in the mitt set. the final analysis was planned after 72 subjects with 6 months follow-up. 
 a pocock boundary of the of the lan-demets family of alpha spending functions was pre-specified for the 
 efficacy interim analysis leading to a nominal significance level of 0.017 in the second interim analysis and 
 0.011 in the final analysis.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 according revised international working group (iwg) response criteria for malignant lymphoma as assessed 
 by the investigator (hereafter referred to as iwg 1999 criteria). for the 2 retrospective databases, response 
 was according to investigator assessment (assessment criteria not available).</p><p>subjects were evaluable for 
 response if they had been determined to be refractory, had commenced therapy for refractory disease, and 
 had evidence of response assessment (a date of assessment and an assessment outcome other than ”not 
 done”) after commencement of therapy.</p><p>the latter condition was included in order to avoid underestimating 
 the response rate by the inclusion of subjects receiving only palliative care after the determination of

 analyses of os indicate that survival is poor in all evaluated subgroups. consistent with the literature review, 
 median os was less than 10 months in all subgroups except those who underwent sct after being 
 determined to be refractory.</p><p>
 standardized analyses of response and survival were undertaken to address these potential imbalances. two 
 covariates were specified for use in the standardization: last refractory subgroup and the occurrence of sct 
 at any time after determination of refractory status. results of the standardized analysis showed a rr of 20% 
 (15%, 25%) and a median os of 3.9 months in scholar-1. the standardized analyses suggested odds 
 ratios for zuma-1: scholar-1 of approximately 3.8 for rr and 8 for cr. standardized analyses of os 
 showed 6-month and 1-year survival rates of 77% and 52%, respectively for subjects in zuma-1 compared 
 with 35% and 17%, respectively, for subjects in scholar-1 and a 77% reduction in the overall risk of death 
 for subjects in zuma-1 relative to scholar-1. these standardized results are considered to confirm a 
 response rate of approximately 20% for subjects with refractory aggressive nhl treated with currently

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>the main study for this application is kte-c19-101 (zuma-1), an open-label single arm multicenter trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of kte-c19 in subjects with refractory aggressive non-hodgkin 
 lymphoma, with supporting evidence coming from initial dose and regime finding nci 09-c 0082 trial. cohort 
 1 of zuma-1 phase 2 included 77 patients with dlbcl cohort 2 included 24 patients with either tfl or pmbcl 
 and the ongoing cohort 3 53 patients, of which about 34 have already been treated. the cohort 3 of zuma-1 
 introduced revised crs and neurotoxicity management algorithm including the prophylactic use of 
 tocilizumab and levatiracetam as well as the reactive use of corticosteroids and was originally not intended to</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 support the primary analysis of zuma-1. clinical studies have been conducted at 25 usa sites and 1 israel site (sourasky medical center). no eu sites have been involved.</p><p>
 dose has been selected based on results of nci study 09c0082 aiming to achieve adequate lymphodepletion 
 and therapeutic levels of anti-cd19 car t cells without intolerable toxicity. the same dosing of conditioning 
 chemotherapy agents and axicabtagene ciloleucel was given in zuma-phase-1 with the result of 1 dlt in 
 altogether 6 dlt-evaluable subjects, which was considered as tolerable and effective dose. hence, no lower 
 dose-regimen for chemotherapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel was implemented for phase 2. the dose finding 
 methodology used in nci 09c-0082 and in phase 1 part of the zuma-1 trial is considered generally 
 acceptable. 
 in phase 2 of zuma-1, of the 111 subjects undergone leukapheresis, 103 subjects (93%) were treated with 
 conditioning chemotherapy and 101 (91%) were treated with yescarta. with respect to the conduct of the 
 zuma-1 phase 2 study, changes concerning particularly eligibility criteria of the target population have been 
 implemented. while some of the changes are safety-related to improve prevention and management of aes 
 associated with car-t cells therapy, other changes concerned study design characteristics. these changes 
 did not affect the integrity of the study. 
 further, 19 protocol deviations in 17 patients of the mitt, population were detected. in most of these 
 patients (12/17), the baseline-pet scan to ensure the diagnose was not performed within 28 days of 
 conditioning chemotherapy, but within day -29 and -41 relative to conditioning chemotherapy, while none of 
 these patients received anti-cancer therapy during the interval. three patients received a compromised 
 product, but all of them received the minimum dose of 1x10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg body weight and responded to therapy. with regard to 7 patients, who either received steroids within 7 days prior to 
 leukapheresis (n=2) or within 5 days prior to infusion with yescarta, the treatment ended 2-4 days before 
 treatment with yescarta in all cases. 
 response determination utilized the iwg criteria with updated recommendations (the lugano classification, 
 cheeson et al, 2014) for evaluation, staging and assessment of response in patients with nhl. 
 assessment of quality-of-life data was not included within the endpoints of zuma-1 phase 2; however, 
 outcomes based on the european quality of life-5 dimensions (eq-5d) are being investigated in cohort 3 of 
 zuma-1 (see rmp).</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>results of the zuma-1 phase 2 study indicated that a single dose of treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel at a target doses of 2 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg (+/- 20%) showed a high increase of orr and a clearly better efficacy profile compared to the retrospective global patient-level pooled study (scholar-1) in patients 
 with aggressive forms of nhl, specifically dlbcl, pmbcl and transformed follicular lymphoma. based on the 
 refined estimation in the itt-population, the orr was 66% with a complete response rate of 47% and a 
 partial response rate of 19% (central review). these data are substantiated by similar orr in zuma-1 phase 
 1 (71% orr) and the subset of 13 subjects from nci 09-c-0082 (69% orr). of note, the average remission 
 rate of salvage therapy based on the scholar-1 results was about 25.7%. despite limited follow up, 
 durability of response is documented. for the 85% of patients with stage iii/iv disease, efficacy assessment 
 based on the central review showed lower values of orr and time-dependent endpoints for patients in 
 advanced disease stages (orr: 69, cr: 45%) compared to stage i/ii patients (orr: 93%, cr: 45%), 
 however a clear superiority compared to historical controls persists and no difference was shown with respect</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/481168/2018</p><p>
 page 84/127 
 to cr rates between patients with advanced disease vs stage i/ii patients. for some patients disappearance of either b-symptoms (6/6 patients) or hepatomegaly (5/6 patients) could be shown.</p><p>
 within zuma-1 phase 2, 101 of 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis received axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 while most of these patients had dlbcl (76%), 16% had tfl and 8% had pmbcl. all patients had a baseline 
 ecog-score of 0/1, the median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 10), 2 patients received study 
 treatment for primary refractory disease, 26% had a history of primary refractory disease, 77% were 
 refractory to 2
 nd or later line of therapy and 21% had a relapse within 12 months following asct. baseline patients and disease characteristics appear very consistent between itt and mitt population. since the 
 overall treatment includes the leukapheresis, chemotherapy and imp-administration, all enrolled patients 
 need to be considered. further, main analyses should reflect the objective response data of the central 
 assessment and not be based on study investigators addressing that the concordance of both assessments 
 was 70.4% and that the local assessment tended systematically towards better outcomes. particularly 
 concerning the open-label, single-arm study, efficacy assessment based on the central review assessment 
 was clearly preferred for regulatory decisions to minimize bias.</p><p>
 by the data cut-off 11 august 2017, the orr based on the mitt-analysis and investigator´s assessment was 
 83% (95%ci: 74% to 90%) with a cr rate of 58%, while the orr based on the itt-population and central 
 review was 66% (95% ci: 56% to 75%) with a cr rate of 47%. these data showed that the response based 
 on the itt-population and further based on the central review was lower, however, the general magnitude of 
 effect compared to the outcomes of scholar-1 remains.</p><p>
 while the estimated median dor was 14 months, the estimated median dor among all complete responders 
 was not reached yet with an estimated median follow-up time of 11.3 months. the orr based on the itt 
 population, central review and the 12 months update is consistent across cohorts in zuma-1: cohort 1, 2 and 
 combined (respectively cohort 1: 64%, cohort 2: 70%, combined 66%) and is also consistent with the nci 
 study (orr: 69.2%) and zuma-1 phase 1 (orr: 71%). 
 orrs and 95% cis for the phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2 combined were further analysed by baseline demographic 
 and disease characteristics, product characteristics, and use of tocilizumab and systemic steroids.</p><p>mean 
 orrs for each subset ranged from 67% to 99% and were comparable to the orr for the phase 2 population 
 overall (83%) based on the mitt and investigator´s assessment. no significant impact of subsets based on 
 age, sex, disease type (dlbcl, pmbcl, or tfl), and refractory subgroups, primary refractory status, 
 refractory status to 2 or more consecutive lines of therapy, disease stage, ipi risk score, tumour burden,</p><p>
 cd4:cd8 ratio of (&gt; 1 or ≤ 1) and the use tocilizumab or steroids (yes or no) became apparent.</p><p>responses 
 also were consistent in subjects whose tumours were retrospectively assessed as cd19+ (orr = 85%) or 
 cd19– (orr = 75%). however, the small sample size limits the significance of this subgroup orr analysis. 
 in view of addressing differences in view of morphology and histology, efficacy outcomes (orr, cr, dor, 
 pfs and os) were assessed for subjects with either tfl or pmbcl in a pooled dataset comprising cohorts 2 
 and 3 from phase 2 of zuma-1, using a cut-off date of 11 aug 2017. the pooled data set comprised a total of 
 23 subjects with tfl (16 from cohort 2 and 7 from cohort 3) and 14 subjects with pmbcl (8 subjects from 
 cohort 2 and 6 subjects from cohort 3) who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel. the orr based on the 
 investigator´s assessment was comparable between dlbcl (83%) and the sum of tfl/pmbcl (76%). some 
 variability was seen with 87% (95% ci: 66%, 97%) for tfl and at 57% (95% ci: 29%, 82%) for pmbcl 
 however better outcomes in terms of time-dependent endpoints. given the small sample size of these 
 subgroups, there are no definite conclusions from these results.

 a retrospective, patient-level, pooled analysis of outcomes in refractory aggressive nhl (n = 636) was conducted (crump et al., 2017).</p><p> 
 of 636 scholar-1 evaluable patients, 389 patients are comprised from two randomized phase 3 clinical 
 studies (170 patients in coral, 219 patients in ly12), while 247 patients (mayo n=82, mdacc n=165) are 
 gained from retrospective databases. scholar-1 was developed as a companion study to zuma-1 to provide 
 context for interpreting the zuma-1 results. the analysis included patients who had not responded (stable 
 disease [sd] or pd) to their last line of therapy, or had relapsed within 12 months after asct.</p><p>the orr was 
 26% [95% ci (21, 31)] and cr rate was 7% [95% ci (3, 15)], with a median os of 6.3 months. the historic 
 orr was pre-specified in zuma-1 phase 2 as 20%. this was in general acknowledged.</p><p>however, after 
 obtaining the historical control data of scholar-1, the rate seems to be too low. the current point estimate of 
 the scholar-1 meta-analysis for the response rate was 25.7% (95% ci: 20.9%, 31.3%). in this light, further 
 analyses are required to show that the orr in zuma-1 is also (“significantly”) higher than the refined historic 
 control based on the point estimate. furthermore, the uncertainty in the estimate should be taken into 
 consideration by comparing the results of zuma-1 also to the upper limit of the confidence interval. 
 a re-analysis as “worst case” scenario was performed, by excluding patients with ecog 2-4, patients with 
 unknown ecog, and patient’s whose baseline assessment was more than 3 months before relapse / 
 refractory disease was diagnosed. with these patients, a head to head comparison of response (cr+pr), cr 
 and os comparing scholar-1 and zuma-1 was conducted. in this comparison, the difference in response 
 rates between</p><p>scholar-1 (“worst case” subset) and zuma-1 (mitt set) was 53.1% (43.6%, 62.5%), the 
 difference in cr rates was 46.9% (36.4%, 57.4%), and the hazard ratio for the reduction in the risk of death 
 for subjects in the zuma-1 study was 0.4 (0.29, 0.56). using the itt set and central review, the difference 
 for orr between scholar-1 (30.1%) and zuma-1 phase 2 (66%) was 35.9% and for cr between scholar-1 
 (11.5%) and zuma-1 phase 2 (47%) 35.5%. these values are lower than these provided by the applicant, 
 but however indicate a superior treatment effect for yescarta. 
 comparison of patients’ covariates of zuma-1 and scholar-1 limited to only coral and ly12 shows a rather 
 equal distribution of patients with regard to gender, ipi-score, and proportion of patients with relapse after 
 asct. the proportion of patients with dlbcl was higher in scholar-1 (90% vs. 76%). zuma-1 even has a 
 larger proportion of patients with worse disease stages and higher numbers of already received 
 chemotherapy numbers.</p><p>while zuma-1 only included patients with ecog-scores of 0-1, this applies to only 
 86% of scholar-1 patients. the provided sensitivity analysis of the standardized estimates and comparisons 
 of response by ecog category (applicant´s answer on loq 172) showed –as expected– that patients with 
 ecog-0 and 1 had better outcomes as patients with ecog 2-4. in detail, table 9 shows that e.g. with respect 
 to the group of patients being refractory to second-or-greater-lines-of therapy, 24 % of these had ecog 0/1, 
 while 8% had ecog 2-4. the same applies for patients, who had a relapse after asct: while 8% of the 
 responder had ecog 0/1, only 1% had ecog 2-4.</p><p>
 it is acknowledged, that dlbcl, pmblc and tfl all are classified as large cell lymphoma due to their 
 similarities with respect to pathogenesis, treatment and outcome. pmbcl and transformed fl are typically 
 treated along a dlbcl treatment paradigm. in accordance with the updated who classification (swerdlow 
 2016) transformed fl is not recognized as an entity but as dlbcl – which is nevertheless an heterogenous 
 group- therefore it was considered redundant to be specifically mentioned in the indication. the indication 
 has further been revised (see smpc section 4.1) reflecting the most recent revision of the who classification 
 (revised 4
 th edition 2017) of b-cell lymphoma subtypes, as: yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and primary mediastinal large 
 b-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 a detailed description of the patients based on genetic analyses and histology according to the who 2016 classification is included within section 5.1 of the smpc, while referring to the limited relevance of the

 currently, several zuma studies are ongoing or planned. updated efficacy data from the ongoing zuma-1 
 study (cohorts 1 &amp; 2) would become available by 4q 2018. the durability of the ongoing responses and 
 additional survival data at 24 months would be provided (see rmp). 
 the applicant provided interim data after treatment of 34/ 50 patients within cohort 3. while these data are 
 not part of the maa, they may support the zuma-1 phase 2 data, particularly those of tfl (n=7) and pmbcl 
 (n=6). while the median follow-up time 5.9 months (range: 1.0 to 9.5 months), the efficacy data are 
 consistent to those of zuma-1 phase 2 with respect to orr sec(62%) and a cr rate of 44% at the data 
 cutoff date of 11 aug 2017. the list of planned studies provided by the applicant also contains zuma-7, with 
 the indication is limited to second line dlbcl patients and with randomized open-label design to demonstrate 
 superiority to soc in terms of efs. zuma-7 trial is expected to provide further information as evaluation of 
 the treatment on patient reported outcomes (pros) and quality of life (qol) compared to soc is part of the 
 secondary study objectives (see rmp).</p></section><section><header n="2.4.9">2.4.9.

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety population set for the primary analysis was originally comprised of 119 subjects from the combined zuma-1 &amp; 2, thus presented a population affected by relapsed/refractory dlbcl, pmbcl and mcl. 
 this approach was modified to include only patients from zuma-1 which is acceptable as there are relevant 
 differences in the population and the treatment of patients recruited to zuma-2. therefore, data from 108 
 patients of the zuma-1 trial (7 patients in phase 1 and 101 patients in phase 2) are considered as principal 
 source of safety information. the data cutoff date for the updated analysis was 11.08.2017, at which time all 
 patients would be followed for 12 months from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
 patients were treated with doses of car-t cells of 1.1-2.2 x 10
 6 car t cells/kg body weight. currently the importance of the actually administered dose is not clear as the car t cells will proliferate in vivo. given the 
 general knowledge of lymphocyte proliferation it seems unlikely that a twofold difference in infused cells 
 would be clinically meaningful, but this is of course dependent on the proliferative capability of the cells. the 
 majority of patients was male (70%), white (90%) and from the usa (99%).</p><p>
 serious adverse reactions occurred in 55% of patients.</p><p>the most common serious adverse reactions include 
 encephalopathy (20%), unspecified pathogen infections (15%), bacterial infections (5%), viral infections 
 (5%), pyrexia (5%), and febrile neutropenia (5%) (smpc section 4.8). 
 close to all patients experienced adverse events related to the investigative product with many (over 80%) 
 having grade 3 or higher events and more than half in all trials having investigative product related saes, 
 and a pattern could be distinguished whereby in particular events of encephalopathy, pyrexia, (febrile) 
 neutropenia, anaemia, hypotension and hypoxia tend to form a non-negligible burden on the subject in the 
 form of grade 3 or higher aes and saes and treatment related deaths. 
 the most common grade 3 or higher adverse reactions include encephalopathy (30%), unspecified pathogen 
 infection (19%), cytokine release syndrome (12%), bacterial infection (8%), aphasia (7%), viral infection 
 (6%), delirium (6%), hypotension (6%) and hypertension (6%). 
 the most serious and frequently occurring adverse reactions are crs (93%), encephalopathy (58%), and 
 infections (38%).</p><p>grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia still present at day 30 or 
 beyond occurred in 31%, 27% and 17% of patients respectively (smpc, section 4.8). 
 sequelae of conditioning chemotherapy such as anaemia, cytopenias, neutropenic fever, infection are an 
 expected ae for the treatment regimen. axicabtagene ciloleucel may contribute to these ae via secondary 
 mechanisms such as sequestration of lymphocytes and platelets following cytokine release or via mechanisms 
 involving the bone marrow function.</p><p>neutropenia, neutropenic fever and infections are very common, as is 
 thrombocytopenia. there were two deaths reported in the supportive dataset that were caused by infection. 
 one death was caused by an intracranial haemorrhage following thrombocytopenia that was assessed as 
 chemotherapy related, an infection may have contributed to the fatal outcome.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome is very commonly observed and is clearly caused by axicabtagene ciloleucel. crs 
 occurred in 93% of patients, 12% of whom experienced grade 3 or higher (severe, life threatening and fatal)</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 crs.</p><p>the median time to onset was 2 days (range 1 to 12 days) and the median duration was 7 days, with a range of 2 to 29 days.</p><p>ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients recovered from crs (smpc, section 4.8). crs 
 have been categorized as identified risk (see risk management plan). 
 cardiac failure has been observed as well as cardiac arrhythmia, possibly aggravated by serum electrolyte 
 disturbances. crs was the likely cause of one fatal case of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and one 
 fatal case of brain injury following cardiac arrest. 
 the most common signs or symptoms associated with crs include pyrexia (76%), hypotension (41%), 
 hypoxia (21%), tachycardia (21%) and chills (19%).</p><p>serious adverse reactions that may be associated with 
 crs include acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, 
 capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage 
 activation syndrome (hlh/mas) (smpc, section 4.8). 
 the phenotypically similar tumour lysis syndrome appears to be less common as could be deduced from the 
 low incidence of reported ae of acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphataemia and increase in 
 serum uric acid. however, a relevant shift to increased values of uric acid and creatinine is reported in the 
 laboratory section which could point to a relevant frequency of tumour lysis syndrome that is not identified as 
 such because of the predominant features of crs. to minimise risk of tls, patients with elevated uric acid or 
 high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, prior to yescarta infusion.</p><p>
 signs and symptoms of tls should be monitored and events managed according to standard guidelines 
 (smpc section 4.4). 
 neurological adverse reactions, especially encephalopathy of varying degrees with symptoms and signs such 
 as somnolence, confusion, tremor, headache or aphasia was observed in the majority of patients. 31% of 
 subjects had a ≥ grade 3 neurological adverse reaction. the median time to the onset of neurological adverse 
 reaction was 5 days (range 1-17) and the median time to resolution was 17 days. the relationship of crs 
 and the neurological adverse reaction still requires further clarification. a pathophysiological explanation of 
 the observed encephalopathy seems rather obscure at present. similar neurotoxicity has been observed with 
 other forms of cd19 directed immunotherapies such as blinatumomab so there is a reason to believe that 
 this is caused either by the intended pharmacological effect, i.e. cyotoxicity and cytokine release by car t 
 cells to their natural cd19 positive target (b cells), cd19 expression on other cells of the central nervous 
 system or crossreactivity to a yet unknown target. however, it may also be caused by systemic crs in a 
 population that is prone to this neurological ae. serious neurologic adverse reactions including cerebral 
 oedema have been been categorized as identified risk (see risk management plan). patients with a history of 
 cns disorders such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischemia may be at increased risk. fatal and serious cases 
 of cerebral oedema have been reported in patients treated with yescarta. patients should be monitored for 
 signs and symptoms of neurologic adverse reactions (table 2). patients should be monitored at least daily for 
 10 days at the qualified healthcare facility following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity.</p><p>
 after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within proximity, of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following 
 infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur at 
 any time. monitoring of vital signs and organ functions should be considered depending on the severity of the 
 reaction. patients who experience grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities should be monitored with 
 continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. provide intensive care supportive therapy for severe or life 
 threatening neurologic toxicities. non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines should be considered as clinically 
 indicated for grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate 
 the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by patients on yescarta.</p><p>this includes the use of tocilizumab</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 serious infections have been very commonly observed with yescarta. patients should be monitored for signs 
 and symptoms of infection before, during, and after yescarta infusion and treated appropriately.</p><p>prophylactic 
 anti-microbials should be administered according to standard institutional guidelines (smpc, section 4.4).

 in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids 
 and other supportive care as medically indicated (smpc, section 4.4).

 patients treated with drugs directed against b cells.</p><p>screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv should be performed

 immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with yescarta and managed using infection

 malignancies.</p><p>in the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, the company should be conctacted to obtain 
 instructions on patient samples to collect for testing (smpc, section 4.4). secondary malignancy has been

 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients exposed to prior cd19-directed therapy. yescarta is not 
 recommended if the patient has relapsed with cd19-negative disease after prior anti-cd19 therapy (smpc, 
 section 4.4).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 there is a theoretical risk of aggravation of gvhd in patients who have previously undergone an allogeneic stem-cell transplant (allo-hsct) and then received donor derived engineered car t cells (from prior allo-
 hsct donor) for their relapsed non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). no patients in the zuma-1 had previously 
 undergone allo-hsct.. aggravation of gvhd has been categorized as potential risk (see risk management 
 plan). 
 needle stick injuries may occur among health care providers, although they have been reduced by minimizing 
 handling of body fluids and needles. no health care providers experienced exposure to axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel during the zuma-1 study. administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not associated with a risk of 
 splash or spill and disposal of used and exposed materials should follow local biosafety guidelines. 
 transmission of infectious agents via product has been categorized as potential risk (see risk management 
 plan). 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel must be prepared and administered per specifications or there is a potential risk of 
 decrease in viability of the product. there have been no reports linked to decrease in viability of the product 
 due to inappropriate preparation of cell infusion in the zuma 1 studies.</p><p>decrease in viability of the product 
 due to inappropriate preparation of infusion has been categorized as potential risk (see risk management 
 plan). 
 the γ retroviral vector pg13-cd19-h3 vector used for transduction of subject-derived autologous t cells is 
 replication-defective and to date, no rcr has been detected in vector lots or in axicabtagene ciloleucel final 
 product lots.</p><p>the risk of rcr occurring in subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel is considered to be 
 low due to 1) the vector and packaging cell line used, and 2) rigorous testing prior to release of the final 
 product.</p><p>replication-competent retrovirus has been categorized as potential risk (see risk management 
 plan). 
 this medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion, equivalent to 15% of the who recommended 
 maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult (smpc, section 4.4). 
 yescarta has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p><p>due to the potential for neurologic 
 events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients should refrain from driving or operating heavy or 
 potentially dangerous machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until resolution of neurologic adverse 
 reactions (smpc, section 4.7). 
 there are no data regarding the signs of overdose with yescarta (smpc, section 4.9).</p><p>
 missing information in several patient groups: use in pregnancy and lactation, use in non-caucasian patient 
 populations, use in hiv, hcv positive patients, new occurrence or exacerbation of an autoimmune disorder 
 and long term safety. routine risk minimization activities recommend specific clinical measures to address 
 these (see risk management plan). 
 in an analysis of safety in several subgroups there was an increase of neurological events in subject ≥65 
 years and a higher incidence of sae and ≥ grade 3 ae in women. the observed acute ae/adr are to a large 
 extent of limited duration and reversible. for the treatment of treatment-related ae the protocol zuma-1 was 
 amended several times. in zuma-1 43/101 subjects were treated with tocilizumab (crs 17, neurological 
 events 33, other 5) and 27/101 subjects received glucocorticoids (crs 6, neurological events 15, other 17).</p><p>
 25/101 received tocilizumab and glucocorticoids. no patient tested positive for replication-competent 
 retrovirus so far. testing will include a 12 months time-point, after this time-point testing will only be 
 performed if a positive result has been obtained earlier or on clinical suspicion.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the updated safety analysis set confirms the initially performed analyses and there are no relevant new findings. supportive data are available from 13 patients using different ae collection methodology and 15 
 patients in a different indication (b-precursor all). the safety database is therefore considered rather 
 limited. the follow-up of patients is short, the median fu time in lymphoma dataset is 5.9 months, maximum 
 17.9 months. safety data from a currently recruiting cohort (phase 3) will be provided (see rmp).</p><p>

 plus autologous stem cell transplant (asct). however, only half of the patients with relapsed/refractory 
 disease may undergo asct, as the others are ineligible for asct (due to an inadequate response to second 
 line therapy, relapse after second or greater line of therapy, failure to mobilize stem cells, or presence of 
 comorbidities). these patients have no curative options and thus have a clear unmet medical need.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.

 population and on the central review assessment was 66 % (95% ci: 56%, 75%) with a complete response 
 rate of 47 %; based on the mitt-population and the investigator orr was 83%. the estimated median dor 
 was 14.0 months (95% ci: 8.3, ne) and was not yet reached in patients who achieved cr with a median 
 follow up of 15.1 months. the average remission rate of salvage therapy based on the scholar-1 results is 
 about 25.7%. orrs and 95% cis for the phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2 combined were further analysed by 
 baseline demographic and disease characteristics, product characteristics, and use of tocilizumab and 
 systemic steroids.</p><p>mean orrs for each subset ranged from 67% to 99% and were comparable to the orr

 unfavourable effects</header><p>the most serious and frequently occurring adverse reactions are crs (93%), encephalopathy (58%), and infections (38%).</p><p>most of the reported acute adverse events are likely to be a consequence of crs such as 
 pyrexia, chills, tachycardia, serum electrolyte changes, headache and myalgia are the consequences to the 
 function of important organs such as hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances and acute kidney 
 injury. two of the reported deaths were likely a consequence of crs. crs occurs predominantly in the first 
 two weeks after infusion and eventually subsides. empirical treatment recommendations have been provided 
 that take severity of crs into account.</p><p> 
 the availability of tocilizumab at all hospitals and associated centres must be ensured by the marketing 
 authorisation holder until an authorised treatment for crs is available in the eu. yescarta will only be 
 supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the healthcare professionals 
 involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational program.</p><p>to mitigate the safety risks 
 associated with the treatment of yescarta, it must be ensured that hospitals and their associated centres that 
 dispense yescarta are specially qualified (see annex ii and rmp). 
 neurological adverse reactions occurred in the majority of patients which appear to be mostly non-localising, 
 i.e. encephalopathy with the symptoms and signs such as change in consciousness levels, disturbance of 
 attention, somnolence, agitation, confusion and attention disturbance but there are also potentially localising 
 symptoms and signs such as ataxia, dyskinesia, speech disorders and aphasia. a case of cerebral oedema 
 with a fatal outcome has been reported from an expansion cohort of the ongoing clinical trial. 
 grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia still present at day 30 or beyond occurred in 
 31%, 27% and 17% of patients respectively. cytopenias were observed very commonly and involved all 
 lineages (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anaemia thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) also associated with 
 the occurrence of infections and bleeding. infections were observed very commonly. there were two deaths 
 reported in the supportive dataset that were caused by infection. one death was caused by an intracranial 
 haemorrhage following thrombocytopenia that was assessed as chemotherapy related, an infection may have 
 contributed to the fatal outcome.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.  
 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>the safety database is considered rather limited in terms of size and duration. the follow-up of patients is short, the median fu time in lymphoma dataset is 5.9 months, maximum 17.9 months. safety data from a 
 currently recruiting cohort (phase 3) will be provided (see rmp).</p><p> 
 a pass study using a registry is planned with the purpose of additional characterization of identified risks, 
 further evaluation of potential risks and missing information with special focus on long-term safety to assess 
 whether administration is associated with subsequent neoplasm (see rmp).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
