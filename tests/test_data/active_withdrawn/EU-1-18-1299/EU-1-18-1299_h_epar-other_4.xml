 problem statement 
 disease or condition</header><p>follicular lymphoma (fl) is the most common indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) with increasing occurrence (1/100.000; esmo 2020). the median age of diagnosis is approx. 60 years of age; however, 
 occurrence in younger age is possible (
 j clin exp hematop, vol 54,june 2014). fl develops due to proliferation of neoplastic germinal center b cells, both centrocytes (small to medium sized cleaved cells) 
 and centroblasts (large non-cleaved cells) that have a follicular pattern of growth (
 kahl 2016). fl is subject of various classifications according to the proportion of centroblastic cells, molecular genetics, 
 immunhistochemics and clinical appearance. the current who edition defines fl in accordance to number 
 of centroblastic cells as grade 1, grade 2, grade 3a and grade 3b. the distinction between grade 3a and 
 3b is important due to their apparent differences in molecular genetics and prognosis; it is suggested that 
 grade 3a fl (no centrocytes, centroblasts only) is on the same spectrum as grade 1-2 fl, and grade 3b 
 fl behaves as de novo dlbcl (
 katzenberger et al., am j pathol 2004; karube et al., blood 2007). clinical classification and score grading are the ann arbor classification, which specifies stage i-iv based on lymph 
 node regions and class a (without symptoms) and b (with symptoms), and the follicular lymphoma 
 international prognostic index (flipi from the pre-rituximab era and flipi2 for rituximab-treated patients), 
 which is used for the stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups. the 
 clinicogenetic risk score m7-flipi, published 2015 in lancet oncology by pastore a et al., is based on flipi 
 score and mutation status of seven candidate genes (
 ezh2, arid1a, mef2b, ep300, foxo1, crebbp and card11). based on an observation of clinical characteristics of 95 patients with fl, lockmer et al., bjhaem 2019</p><p>concluded, however that the prognostic factor may be different when applied in a context of different therapeutically agents.</p><p>
 treatment 
 the heterogeneity of fl in terms of clinical, histological and molecular-genetic presentation both at initial 
 diagnosis and increasingly in the course of the disease, which is highly variable both between patients and 
 intra-patient (
 kahl&amp;yang, 2016; fredman, 2018; lockmer at al.) due to the risk of histological transformations, explains the challenges, clinicians are facing. although there are numerous therapeutically 
 options, there seems to be a lack of robust tools for initiation of the right treatment regimen to the right 
 time.</p><p>
 newly diagnosed, low-grade, limited stage fl is often responsive to first-line treatments. advanced stage 
 fl generally requires multiple successive lines of therapy leading to shorter remission periods, chemo-
 refractory disease and transformation to diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) (about 40% of all fl 
 patients). transformed follicular lymphomas (tfl) have a worse prognosis due to poorer response to 
 treatment than primary dlbcl. surgery is not used as a general treatment option; however, removing of 
 symptomatic limited affected organs/tissue may be useful in some cases.</p><p>
 for patients with limited low tumor burden stages i-ii, a radiotherapy-based treatment with or without 
 combination with rituximab is clinical standard followed by consolidation/maintenance, e. g. with rituximab 
 for 2 years. myeloablative consolidation followed by asct prolongs pfs, but advantage on os has not been</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 9/102</p><p> observed (schaaf et al, cochrane database syst rev 2012). patients in advanced stages of fl or cases where radiotherapy is not feasible are treated with systemic (combined) chemo-immunotherapy, 
 immunomodulatory agents and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitors. complete response (cr) 
 rates are low, however, ranging from 1% to 14% (
 dreyling 2017). autologous (auto-sct) and allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-sct) may benefit only a small fraction of patients. therefore, most of the patients 
 will experience disease progression, relapse or refractory disease, and prognoses for these patients are 
 poor. despite the advances in the treatment of fl, there is an unmet need for patients with refractory 
 and/or relapsed fl, who failed on available therapies.</p></section><section><header>figure 1. esmo recommendations for low tumour burden fl (november 2020)</header><p>ema/622447/2022

 step. fl is preceded by an asymptomatic preclinical phase in which premalignant b cells carrying a t(14;18) 
 reciprocal chromosomal translocation develop additional genetic alterations, although not all of these cells 
 progress to the tumour phase. the aetiology of fl is unknown; family history is important (
 br j haematol 2009
 ) and t(14;18) alone is considered not sufficient to cause fl (haematologica, 2014).</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 about the product</header><p>axicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous car t-cell product in which a subject’s t cells are engineered to express receptors consisting of a single-chain antibody fragment against cd19 linked to cd3ζ and cd28 t-
 cell activating domains that result in elimination of cd19-expressing cells {jackson 2016, roberts 2018}. 
 following car engagement with cd19+ target cells, the cd3ζ domain activates the downstream signaling 
 cascade that leads to t-cell activation, proliferation, and acquisition of effector functions, such as 
 cytotoxicity {roberts 2018}. the intracellular signaling domain of cd28 provides a costimulatory signal 
 that works in concert with the primary cd3ζ signal to augment t-cell function, including interleukin (il)-2 
 production {finney 1998}. together, these signals stimulate proliferation of the car t cells and direct 
 killing of target cells. in addition, activated t cells secrete cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that 
 can recruit and activate additional antitumor immune cells {restifo 2012}. 
 yescarta was approved in 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
 b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl), after two or more lines 
 of systemic therapy.</p><p>a single dose of yescarta contains 2 x 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (or maximum of 2 x 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 ml dispersion in an infusion bag.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.

 non-clinical aspects</header><p>one additional non-clinical genotoxicity study has been submitted in the application. the genotoxic potential of axicabtagene ciloleucel is related to the risk of insertional oncogenesis as a result of vector integration

 indication.</p><p>
 the risk of insertional oncogenesis has previously been assessed by literature review and the clinical 
 experience gained with administration of human t cells that were transduced with γ-retroviral vectors. the 
 newly submitted non-clinical genotoxicity study investigated the vector integration sites (vis) in anti-cd19 
 car t cells generated using the kte-c19 manufacturing process and t cells from three healthy donors. the 
 data revealed an even vis diversity for all three donors at the end of manufacturing. no over-represented 
 vis could be detected suggesting that no transduced t-cell clone had acquired a significant growth 
 advantage resulting from the integration event.</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 pharmacokinetics 
 general  
 methods, endpoints and objectives for primary/secondary analysis on pk/pd</header><p>the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for axicabtagene ciloleucel in this application are based on 1 clinical study: kte-c19-105 (zuma-5). zuma-5 is a phase 2, multicenter, ongoing open-label study 
 evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with r/r b-cell inhl of fl or mzl histological 
 subtypes. evaluations of pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 were included as secondary endpoints. the results on pd are provided in the primary analysis report with 
 the data cutoff date of 12 march 2020 only, and pk-parameters are evaluated and provided both in the 
 primary analysis report with the data cutoff date of 12 march 2020 and in the 18-months analysis addendum 
 with dco 14 september 2020. the assessments were based on known or hypothesized aspects of the 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel mechanism of action, and the current knowledge of the safety profile of the 
 lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen and of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. the number, frequency, 
 and timing of blood or serum samples collected for pk and pd analyses were based on the expected 
 concentration-time profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel. presented subgroup analyses should be considered 
 descriptive only, as the study was not designed to test for differences between groups.</p><p> 
 the safety analysis set was used for summary analyses of pk and pd and correlation to safety outcomes. 
 at the cut-off date of 12 march 2020 and 14 september 2020, the safety analysis set comprised respectively 
 146 and 148 subjects with inhl treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel, including 124 subjects 
 with fl and 22 (24 for 18-month update) subjects with mzl.</p><p>
 the inferential analysis set was used for correlation to clinical efficacy outcomes. the inferential analysis 
 set comprised 104 subjects, including 84 subjects with fl and 20 subjects with mzl.</p><p>
 assessments at the time of the primary analysis (data cut-off date of 12 march 2020) included presence, 
 expansion, and persistence of gene-marked anti-cd19 car t cells in blood (pk parameters), levels of b 
 cells in blood over time (to monitor on-target/off-tumor effect), and levels of key soluble analytes (cytokines 
 and chemokines) in serum over time (pd parameters). exploratory correlative analyses of pk and pd results 
 with baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were also performed.</p><p>
 the presence, expansion, and persistence of anti-cd19 chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cells were 
 measured in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) derived from whole blood of 
 subjects treated in zuma-5. serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a validated 
 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay. the qpcr assay was based on the method developed 
 by kochenderfer and colleagues {kochenderfer 2012, kochenderfer 2015, kochenderfer 2017a} and was 
 further optimized and validated by the university of rochester medical center (urmc) central lab services. 
 the qpcr assay was demonstrated to be specific for cells with a stably integrated anti-cd19 car transgene. 
 the lower limit of detection was established at 1 cell equivalent per 100,000 pbmcs (0.001%), and the 
 lower limit of quantification (lloq) was established at 8 to 110 cell equivalents per 100,000 pbmcs 
 depending on dna sample load.</p></section><section><header>table 1: pharmacological methods used in zuma-5</header><p>category/method description</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 summary of results 
 - after lymphodepleting chemotherapy treatment, median serum levels of crp and il-15 increased by at 
 least 2-fold. consistent with lymphodepletion, median serum levels of perforin decreased during this same 
 time period. 
 - on day 3 after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, median serum levels of the majority of key analytes 
 remained steady relative to baseline levels (&lt; 2-fold change; cxcl10, granzyme b, icam-1, il-1ra, il 
 2rα, il-7, tnf-α, and vcam-1) or were elevated by at least 2-fold relative to baseline (crp, ferritin, ifn-
 γ, il-2, il-6, il-8, il-10, and il-15). 
 - with the exception of perforin, the median time to peak for all key analytes was within 8 days after 
 infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel (range of medians: 4 to 8 days), coinciding with the peak anti-cd19 car 
 t-cell expansion at 8 days; the median time to peak for perforin was 29 days, indicative of endogenous t-
 cell recovery. the majority of analytes increased by 2-fold or more at peak in ≥ 50% of subjects 
 (exceptions: granzyme b, icam-1, perforin, tnf-α, and vcam-1).</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>in general, the results presented on pk and pd and on measurable associations with both the drug product and the clinical parameters on safety and efficacy can be considered in line with current knowledge in the 
 pharmacology of car t cell therapy. the observed variability in engraftment kinetics is known to be 
 multifactorial (applied dose, conditioning therapy etc.), which might be an explanation for the observed 
 differences within defined and between defined groups.</p><p>
 the relationship between axicabtagene ciloleucel exposure and clinical efficacy is obvious. interestingly, in 
 terms of or rates, there seem to be no significant differences in the median peak anti-cd19 car-t cell 
 levels between responders and non-responders in contrast to median auc0-28 levels, whereas in terms of 
 ongoing response, the differences in both median peak car t- cell levels and auc0-28 are obvious.</p><p>
 onset and severity of crs and neurological events coincides with the kinetics of engraftment of 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel and a rise in the concentration of cytokines in the serum. with regard to pk and the 
 occurrence of crs and/or neurological events, higher anti-cd19 car</p><p>t-cell levels (peak and auc
 0-28
 ) were 
 associated with grade 3 or higher crs and neurological events, an observation, which is known according 
 to scientific publications. results presented on pd and clinical safety endpoints (crs and neurological 
 events) indicate a positive association of most of the 17 key cytokines, chemokines and immune effector 
 molecules with higher grade crs and neurological events, an observation, which is also in compliance with 
 current scientific knowledge in the treatment with car t-cell products.</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 • autologous stem cell transplant within 6 weeks of planned axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion • history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation • prior cd19 targeted therapy with the exception of subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel in this study and are eligible for retreatment 
 • prior car therapy or other genetically modified t-cell therapy as per protocol amendment 2 (19 jan 2018), the main inclusion criterion with regard to eligible inhl 
 histology was revised to limit histologically proven b-cell inhl to the fl (grade 1, 2 or 3a) or mzl nodal or 
 extranodal histological subtypes based on the who 2016 classification and to remove primary relapse and 
 relapse after asct high risk categories of inhl. an additional inclusion criterion was added to require 
 relapse or refractory disease after 2 or more prior lines of therapy and that prior therapy must have included 
 an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody combined with an alkylating agent (single agent anti-cd20 antibody 
 was not counted as line of therapy for eligibility). additionally, it was clarified that stable disease (without 
 relapse) &gt; 1 year from completion of last therapy is not eligible. furthermore, the inclusion criterion with 
 the requirement of having at least 1 measurable lesion was updated to include the more recent lugano 
 response criteria for malignant lymphoma (cheson et al, 2014). and finally, the requirement for mri of</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 • full analysis set (fas): all enrolled (leukapheresed) subjects; this set was to be used for sensitivity analyses.

 page 34/102</p><p> statistical hypotheses four hypotheses were tested using a fixed sequence procedure in terms of orr and cr rate as determined by central review to control the overall type i error at 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 with the 
 following testing order: 
 • hypothesis 1 (h1): orr as determined by central review less than 40% in subjects with fl in the ias 
 • hypothesis 2 (h2): cr rate as determined by central review less than 15% in subjects with fl in the ias 
 • hypothesis 3 (h3): test for orr as determined by central review less than 40% in subjects with fl in the ias who had had 3 or more lines of prior therapy 
 • hypothesis 4 (h4): test for cr rate as determined by central review less than 15% in subjects with fl in the ias who had had 3 or more lines of prior therapy</p><p>
 hypotheses h1 through h4 were to be assessed at the time of the interim analyses 3, 4, and 5 and at the 
 time of the primary analysis. no formal hypothesis testing was planned for the mzl histological subtype. 
 the analysis is descriptive only. 
 historical control orr and cr rates the historical control rate for orr was estimated based on results of limited available data on the approved therapies for r/r fl after 2 or more prior lines of therapy. these approved therapies at the time 
 of trial design were the pi3k inhibitors idelalisib and copanlisib. in the trial of idelalisib, the orr and cr 
 rate for patients with relapsed fl after 2 or more prior lines of therapy were 54% and 8%, respectively, 
 and in the trial of copanlisib, the orr and cr rate for patients with r/r fl after 2 or more prior lines of 
 therapy were 59% and 14%, respectively. it was anticipated that most subjects would have had prior 
 treatment with at least one of the aforementioned pi3k inhibitors; thus, an orr &lt;40% or cr rate &lt;15% 
 would not be of clinical interest. therefore, these rates were used for hypothesis testing. 
 analyses of primary and secondary endpoints the subject incidence of objective response and complete response together with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be calculated with the clopper-pearson method. an exact binomial test was to be used 
 to compare the orr and cr per central read among the subjects with fl and among the subjects with fl 
 who have had 3 or more lines of prior therapy to the hypothesized historical control rates of 40% and 
 15%, respectively.</p><p> kaplan-meier plots, estimates, and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be generated for dor, pfs 
 and os. kaplan-meier estimates were to be provided for the proportion of subjects who were alive and 
 progression-free at 3-month time intervals. the number of subjects censored or having had events was 
 to be summarized, as well as the reasons for censoring and the event type (pd or death; if applicable).</p><p>
 the reverse kaplan-meier approach (schemper and smith 1996) was to be used to estimate the follow-up 
 time for dor.</p><p>
 planned analyses five interim analyses were planned. an independent data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) was to be chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an analysis of risk versus benefit. the 5 
 interim analyses were as follows:</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 35/102</p><p> • interim analysis 1 was to be conducted after 10 subjects in the safety analysis set had been enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and had had an opportunity to be followed for 
 4 weeks. this analysis was to be for safety only. 
 • interim analysis 2 was to be conducted after 30 subjects in the safety analysis set had been enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and had had an opportunity to be followed for 
 4 weeks. this analysis was to be for safety only. 
 • interim analysis 3 was to be performed when 30 subjects in the fl inferential set had had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. this interim 
 analysis was to be for safety and to assess early demonstration of efficacy.</p><p>
 • interim analysis 4 was to be performed when 80 subjects in the fl inferential analysis set had had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.</p><p>
 • interim analysis 5 was to be performed when at least 80 subjects with fl in the inferential analysis set had had the opportunity to be followed for 9 months after the first disease response 
 assessment.</p><p>
 • the primary analysis was to be performed when at least 80 subjects with fl in the inferential analysis set have had the opportunity to be followed for 12 months after the first disease 
 response assessment. 
 additionally the following updated analyses were planned: 
 • follow-up analysis 1 was planned to be performed when 80 subject in the fl inferential analysis set have had the opportunity to be followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
 this analysis was to be for safety and efficacy and was to be descriptive. 
 • follow-up analysis 2 was planned to be performed when 80 subjects in the fl inferential analysis set have had the opportunity to be followed for 24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
 this analysis was to be for safety and efficacy and was to be descriptive. 
 • the final analysis was to occur after all subjects have completed the study. it should be noted that subjects with mzl were included in the fifth interim analysis and the primary 
 analysis if they had had the opportunity to undergo the week 4 disease assessment. 
 an alpha spending function was to be used to allocate the alpha level between interim analyses 3, 4, and 
 5, and the primary analysis. using the o’brien-fleming boundary of the lan-demets family of alpha 
 spending functions, the nominal 1-sided alpha used to test for efficacy at interim analyses 3 was 
 0.0003.with protocol amendment 5 the remaining alpha was split for interim analyses 4, 5 and primary 
 analysis as 0.0005, 0.0005, and 0.0237.</p><p>
 multiplicity control over endpoints if the criteria for early efficacy were met for h1, the same alpha spending function was to be applied to test h2 at this interim analysis; otherwise, h2 through h4 was not be tested until the subsequent 
 analysis. if the criteria for early efficacy were met for h1 and h2, the same alpha spending function was 
 to be applied to test h3; otherwise, h3 and h4 were not to be tested until the subsequent analysis. if the 
 criteria for early efficacy were met for h1, h2, and h3, the same alpha spending function was to be 
 applied to test h4; otherwise, h4 was not be tested until the subsequent analysis. the study was not to 
 be stopped if early efficacy was demonstrated.</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 assessment. although central confirmation of diagnosis was retrospective and was not required for 
 treatment or continued enrolment on the study per protocol and statistical analysis plan (sap), the 
 number of enrolled subjects with histologic confirmation of fl by central assessment was 101 subjects in 
 the fas. for the majority of the 26 subjects for which local diagnosis of fl could retrospectively not be 
 confirmed per central assessment (“inconclusive”/”other”), this was due to the following: 1) the protocol 
 did not mandate that the same tissue specimens had to be reviewed by local and central review 
 pathologists, 2) the majority of the non-confirmed fl by central assessment were due to insufficient 
 tissue, and 3) insufficient tumor in the samples provided. only for 5 of the 26 subjects central lab 
 assessment was highly suggestive of an alternative non-fl diagnosis (3 subjects with transformed fl, 1 
 subject with small b-cell lymphoma, and 1 subject with mzl per central assessment). these 5 subjects 
 were subsequently excluded from the fas. 
 among subjects with fl (subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl excluded), the full analysis set (fas) 
 comprised 122 subjects. of these subjects, 119 were included in the safety analysis set, 81 were included</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 no manufacturing failures occurred. the median time from leukapheresis to the products release from the 
 manufacturing site was 12.0 days (range: 10 to 37 days). axicabtagene ciloleucel was delivered to the 
 study site a median of 17.0 days (range: 13 to 72 days) after leukapheresis and was administered to the 
 subject a median of 27.0 days (range: 19 to 330 days) after leukapheresis. delays that occurred (&gt; 50 
 days) from manufacturing of the product to delivery to the clinical site or from leukapheresis to infusion of 
 the product were due to the clinical course of the disease.</p></section><section><header>conduct of the study</header><p>on june 2017, the first subject was screened in this study and the first subject was enrolled on 20 jun 2017. the data cutoff date for the primary analysis (12-month follow-up) was 12 march 2020. the data

 the cr rate was 80% (67/84 subjects, 95% ci: 70%, 88%), which was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) 
 than the prespecified control rate of 15%. therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected and the criteria for 
 the key secondary endpoint of cr rate was met (hypothesis 2). 
 among the 58 subjects with fl who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy, the orr was 95% (55 of 58 
 subjects, 95% ci: 86%, 99%), with a cr rate of 81% (47 of 58 subjects, 95% ci: 69%, 90%). the orr

 the cr rate among subjects with fl who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy was tested because the orr 
 among these subjects was significant. the cr rate of 81% was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) than the 
 prespecified control rate of 15%; therefore, the criteria for efficacy for the secondary endpoint of cr rate 
 in subjects who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy was met (hypothesis 4). 
 24 month fu analysis (dco 31 mar 2021) based on the 24-month data cutoff date, the orr and cr rate of subjects with fl who received 3 or more lines of therapy in the fas and ias excluding centrally confirmed non-fl were similar (orr: 91% versus 
 95% respectively; cr rate: 77% versus 78%, respectively). among the subjects with fl who received 3 or 
 more lines of therapy in the fas excluding centrally confirmed non-fl and who achieved a cr or pr, the 
 median time to first objective response was 0.99 month (range: 0.8 to 3.1 months). among the 58 subjects 
 who achieved a cr, the median time to first cr was 1.05 month (range: 0.8 to 12.1 months). twenty nine 
 out of 75 fl patients who had 3 or more prior lines of therapy initially achieved a pr, 19 of whom later 
 achieved cr. the km median estimates of dor, pfs, os, and ttnt in the fas and ias were similar (dor: 
 38.6 months in each analysis set; pfs: 40.2 versus 28.0 months, respectively; os: not estimable in each 
 analysis set; ttnt: 40.2 versus 39.6 months, respectively). the pattern of the km pfs plots in the fas and 
 ias are parallel. median follow-up time for dor was 22.6 months (95% ci: 18.8, 23.0 months).</p></section><section><header>table 9.summary of key efficacy results of subjects with fl who received 3 or more lines of prior therapy excluding centrally confirmed non-fl (fas and ias); dco 31mar2021</header><p>ema/622447/2022

 hypothesis 
 the hypothesis is that the orr of subjects with fl or subjects with fl and 3 or more 
 prior lines of therapy, determined by central assessment, to axicabtagene ciloleucel was 
 significantly higher than the pre-specified historical orr of 40% and the cr rate of 
 subjects with fl or subjects with fl and 3 or more prior lines of therapy, determined by 
 central assessment, to axicabtagene ciloleucel was significantly higher than the pre-

 objectives 
 • to describe clinical and demographic characteristics and treatment patterns in patients with r/r inhl in the real-world setting, who would be eligible for car-t. 
 • to estimate overall response rate (orr) among patients with r/r inhl in the real-world setting. complete response (cr), partial response (pr), overall survival (os), duration of response (dor), 
 progression-free survival (pfs) and time to next treatment (ttnt) will be secondary endpoints. 
 • to compare selected outcomes from the external comparator cohort to those from the zuma- 5 clinical trial. 
 • to describe patient’s quality of life based on available patient reported outcomes (pros) as an exploratory objective. 
 main inclusion criteria 
 • patients aged ≥18 years • patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of inhl, with histological subtype limited to fl grade 1, grade 2, or grade 3a or mzl nodal / extranodal based on criteria established by the world health 
 organization (who) 2016 classification (restricted to patients with fl in the analysis stage) 
 • patients with r/r disease (i.e., r/r inhl) starting third or higher line of therapy on or after 23rd july 2014 (exact date differed according to individual cohort component protocols) 
 main exclusion criteria 
 • transformed fl • fl histological grade 3b • prior anti-cd19 car t-cell therapy or other genetically modified t-cell therapy • eligible within 12 months before of the end of the study database cut-off trial conduct

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>initially, the zuma-5 trial was designed as a single-arm open-label phase 2 multicenter trial in subjects with r/r inhl, and initially patients with biopsy proven progression of r/r follicular lymphoma grade 1, grade 
 2 or grade 3a have been enrolled. between the original trial protocol, dated 26 november 2016 and the 
 current valid version of amendment 5, dated 24 july 2019, a couple of important changes have been 
 introduced, including the addition of patients with r/r marginal zone lymphoma. according to the final 
 protocol, the two cohorts (fl and mzl) were analysed together with very different follow up criteria. the 
 minimum follow-up for mzl patients for the primary analysis was 4 weeks, while the minimum follow-up 
 for fl patients was 12 months. as the sought indication is only for fl pooling of mzl and fl patients is not 
 considered sensible.</p><p>
 the trial was a single-arm open-label trial, and therefore sensitive to selection bias and assessment bias. 
 a dsmb was tasked with the interim review of data. the applicant further planned to protect the conduct 
 of study via limited access of company members to the data of the ongoing trial which was defined in a 
 “trial integrity document”. however, the document showed that many subjects had broad access to raw 
 and aggregated data at all times. no firewall was in place. functions such as biostatisticians were granted 
 full access to the data at any time and were involved in drafting protocol amendments which included 
 substantial changes to the confirmatory analyses (including changes in endpoints, analysis populations, 
 number and timing of interim analyses and type 1 error control over interim analyses). interim analyses 4 
 and 5 were furthermore defined only after the successful interim analysis 3 was conducted. this shows that 
 the conduct of trial was not to the usual standards for a well conducted confirmatory trial, but is not 
 expected to have a major negative impact on general data integrity.</p><p>
 the high number of relevant changes and adaptations of the study protocol (6 protocol amendments) and 
 the sap during the conduct of the trial is noticeable, and may result from the clinical trial initially not having 
 been planned as a pivotal and/or supportive clinical trial for the indication extension on r/r fl. however, no 
 major impact on the data is estimated. the change to add prior therapy with an anti-cd20 monoclonal 
 antibody combined with an alkylating agent as inclusion criterion, e.g., was required in order to ensure that 
 subjects have received standard first line therapy prior to enrollment. 
 as requested, the applicant provided data on clinical efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the indication of 
 r/r fl after 3 or more prior lines of therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl and for a 
 recent data cutoff date (24-month follow-up analysis data cutoff date: 31 march 2021). the originally 
 reported results for orr, cr and duration of response in subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel after 
 3l+ therapy remain compelling, although uncertainties related to a single arm trial may be raised. most of 
 the included patients had not received prior hdt and autologous asct. due to the safety and the logistic 
 issues of car-t therapy, this treatment should be reserved to fl grade 1-3a patients following at least 3-
 4 prior therapies, including hdt. patients with fl grade 3b have been excluded from the pivotal trial, while 
 the proposed target indication in r/r fl actually includes all grade fl, including fl grade 3b. the 
 extrapolation to patients with fl grade 3b is considered permissible, as in clinical practice fl grade 3b is 
 often treated as dlbcl, for which axi-cel is also indicated. 
 a relatively large proportion of subjects (n=23; 19%) reported an important protocol deviation (ipd), from 
 which only a minority [n = 3;2 %)] could be explained as related to the outbreak of the covid-19 
 pandemic. most of the ipds related to missing data were missed fu-antibody samples, missed two</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 56/102</p><p> consecutive exams and missed post treatment pet-ct and/or diagnostic cts. moreover, there were important differences in number and nature of protocol deviations between study sites, requiring the 
 applicant’s remote observation of one site, were n=111 pds occurred in 7 subjects included. however, no 
 major risks were identified and it was concluded that these ipd may not had a negative impact on general 
 data integrity.</p><p>
 bridging therapy between leukapheresis and ldc based on investigator decision was not excluded according 
 to the zuma-5 clinical trial protocol and 4 subjects with fl excluding centrally confirmed non-fl received 
 bridging therapy. 
 for subjects who received bridging chemotherapy, pet-ct scan was to be performed to 
 establish a new baseline before the start of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which ensured that bridging 
 chemotherapy did not impact the analysis of the disease response.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>(based on 24-month dco) zuma-5 the full analysis set (fas) of subjects with fl excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl and who 
 received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, which is the claimed target indication of this maa, comprised 75 subjects. 
 the majority of subjects presented with disease stage grade iii (n=34; 45%) and grade iv (n=31; 41%), 
 and with intermediate (flipi total score of 2) (n=30; 40%) and high risk (flipi total score of 3-5) (n=34; 
 45%) disease. the retrospective cd19 status for n=69/75 evaluable subjects per central assessment 
 revealed that 56 subjects of these 69 (90.3%) were confirmed cd19 positive, 6 subjects were cd19 
 negative, and 7 subjects’ cd19 antigen status were missing/inconclusive at baseline. the median number 
 of prior therapy lines was 4 (range: 3 to 10), and 45 subjects (60%) had received 4 or more lines of 
 therapy. twenty two subjects (29%) had previously received auto-sct and 30 subjects (40%) had 
 previously been treated with a pi3k inhibitor. with 91% of subjects with at least 1 high-risk prognostic 
 factor (progression within 24 months from the first anti-cd20-chemotherapy combination therapy, within 
 6 months after the last line of prior therapy, or after auto-sct), overall this population can been considered 
 at high risk with a medical need for alternative treatment options. 
 response rates at 24 months follow-up in the fas for subjects with fl who received ≥ 3 lines of prior 
 therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl (n = 75): the primary and secondary endpoints 
 orr and cr were 91% (68 of 75 subjects, 95% ci: 82%, 96%) and 77% (58 of 75 subjects, 95% ci: 
 66%, 86%).</p><p>
 with regard to dor the km-median was 38.6 months (95% ci: 24.7, ne) in the fas for subjects with fl 
 who received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl. the subjects 
 with fl had a median follow-up time for dor of 22.6 months (95% ci: 18.8, 23.0 months). among the 75 
 subjects with fl who received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, km estimates of pfs rates at 24 months was 
 71.8% (95% ci: 58.6%, 81.4%). the km median for pfs was 40.2 months (95% ci: 26.6, ne). the km 
 median for os was not reached (95% ci: 40.2 months, ne), with a median follow-up time of 29.7 months 
 (95% ci: 26.9, 31.87 months). estimates of os at 24 months was 85.5% (95% ci: 74.6, 91.9%).</p><p>
 w
 ith regard to analyses for dor and pfs, patients who received other anticancer therapies (including hsct 
 and axi-cel retreatment) were censored. as this kind of analysis might be prone to informative censoring, 
 upon request, sensitivity analyses for dor and pfs in the fl fas excluding centrally confirmed non-fl who 
 received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy, considering the start of other new anticancer therapies or axi-cel 
 retreatment in the absence of prior documented progression as an event (ema censoring rules), were 
 provided. although a larger difference in median pfs has been noted between primary and sensitivity 
 analysis (40.2 months and 28.9 months, respectively), outcomes for dor were very similar (both median 
 and k-m plots) and k-m curves for pfs also followed a similar pattern. in conclusion, censoring patients</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 57/102</p><p> who started a new anticancer therapies or were retreated with axi-cel retreatment in the absence of prior documented progression as reported by central assessment on dor and pfs outcomes, is not considered 
 impactful for the interpretation of data. median follow-up time for ttnt was 29.3 months (95% ci: 25.7, 
 33.6 months). the km median ttnt was 40.2 months (95% ci: 26.6, ne). the longest ttnt was 43.3 
 months as of the data cutoff date. the km estimates of the proportion of subjects who had not commenced 
 subsequent therapy at months 24 was 67.0% (95% ci: 54.8%, 76.6%). 
 although the number of subjects with cd19 negative status at baseline is small, and thus results should be 
 interpreted with caution, efficacy outcomes (cr rate, orr and dor) and pk in patients with baseline cd19
 - status seemed to be at least non-inferior compared to the efficacy outcomes and pk in patients with cd19+ status. in addition, although the data on confirmed cd19 antigen status at relapse are few, there is no evidence of cd19
 − escape. only n=8/75 subjects (11%) in fas with fl excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl and who 
 received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy were non-us subjects (in particular from france), which might 
 compromise the external validity of the zuma-5 study. a significant difference observed is the higher 
 number of prior auto-sct (65%/eu versus 25%/us). however, response (cr rate) and safety profile seem 
 consistent between subjects from eu and us. 
 the results provided for the requested revised analysis sets, and for the 24-month data cut-off date indicate 
 that the orr and cr rate of subjects with fl who received 3 or more lines of therapy in the fas and ias 
 excluding centrally confirmed non-fl were similar (orr: 91% versus 95% respectively; cr rate: 77% 
 versus 78%, respectively). the km median estimates of dor, pfs, os, and ttnt in the fas and ias were 
 similar (dor: 38.6 months in each analysis set; pfs: 40.2 versus 28.0 months, respectively; os: not 
 estimable in each analysis set; ttnt: 40.2 versus 39.6 months, respectively).</p><p>
 scholar-5 
 scholar-5 as a synthetic supportive trial can be acknowledged in general. in a comparative analysis orr 
 and cr in scholar-5 was lower than in zuma-5. the statistical challenges such as potential bias (due to 
 different sources) which are inherent to single-arm trials with external controls make further conclusions 
 from this data impossible. os and pfs from single-arm trials should not be compared with external controls 
 due to an unknown magnitude of bias. the data from scholar-5 overall is considered overall supportive.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.3">2.5.3.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>the data presented on primary and secondary endpoints in subjects with r/r fl, the target indication in the zuma-5 trial, indicate a benefit for the patients. the trial was a single-arm open label trial without a good 
 firewall in place to protect decision making to be influenced by the available data. decisions to include 
 further interim analyses (ia4 and 5) were even made post hoc after the results from interim analysis 3 
 were known. given that the first efficacy interim analysis (ia3) was significant and given the very high 
 effects both for orr as well as crr at all analyses this is not considered of major relevance for the overall 
 extension of indication procedure. the trial is considered to have met the primary objective at ia3, which 
 is then numerically supported by analyses with more subjects and longer follow up. the conduct of trial 
 was not up to the usual standards, however, this is not expected to have a negative impact on general data 
 integrity.</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>the important identified risks and the potential risks identified for axicabtagene ciloleucel are similar to the aes identified for this product class. no further risks and aes could be identified which would be specific for 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel or for the indications to be treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. the important 
 identified risks are crs, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. 
 a new indication is being sought for the treatment of adult patients with r/r fl after three or more lines of 
 systemic therapy with this submission. the evaluation of safety is based on the zuma-5 study. the initial 
 analysis cutoff date is march 12, 2020, which represents the 12 months follow-up data. additional safety 
 data were from the follow-up analysis 1, with a data cutoff date of 14 september 2020, (hereafter referred 
 to as the 18-month analysis) of zuma-5. this prespecified analysis was performed when at least 80 subjects 
 with fl had had the opportunity to be followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.</p><p>
 supporting safety data are also presented from 3 studies of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with 
 aggressive large b-cell lymphomas: kte-c19-101 (zuma-1), kte-c19-109 (zuma-9), and kte-c19-112 
 (zuma-12). the additional safety data are provided with a data cutoff date of 11 august 2020.</p></section><section><header>patient exposure</header><p>throughout the documents, the applicant presented data for patients with fl, but also for patients with marginal zone lymphoma (mzl), sometimes combining these patients in an indolent nhl group. for the 
 primary safety evaluation in this ar, the data obtained in fl patients were considered as main data (18-
 month follow-up, data cutoff 14 september 2020), and data from mzl patients were considered supportive.</p><p>
 the safety analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel.</p></section><section><header>table 15. analysis sets (data cutoff 14 sept 2020)</header><p>in total, as of the 18-month follow-up (cutoff 14 september 2020), 153 subjects with inhl were enrolled (ie, underwent leukapheresis):</p></section><section><header n="127">127 subjects with fl</header><p>, 25 subjects with mzl, and 1 subject with dlbcl. the dlbcl was discovered via a pretreatment biopsy that was examined after the subject enrolled;</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 59/102</p><p> consequently, the subject was deemed ineligible and was withdrawn from the study. a total of 148 subjects (</p></section><section><header n="124">124 subjects with fl</header><p> and 24 subjects with mzl) had received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel; 5 subjects had not received lymphodepleting chemotherapy or axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel. one of these 5 subjects was the aforementioned subject with dlbcl who was deemed ineligible; 
 the reasons for not receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel for the other 4 
 subjects were as follows:</p><p>
 - one subject with fl died due to cardiac arrest before having the opportunity to be treated on 
 study. 
 - one subject with fl was found to be ineligible after enrollment but prior to treatment due to 
 inadequate platelet levels (&lt; 75,000 per mm3); this subject was treated under a compassionate 
 use protocol and was not included in the safety analysis set. 
 - one subject with fl was leukapheresed, but experienced a cr prior to lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy and had partially withdrawn at the time of data cutoff; the subject remains in follow-
 up. 
 - one subject with mzl was leukapheresed, but experienced a cr prior to lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy and was considered ineligible to receive infusion based on inclusion criteria; the 
 subject remains in follow-up. 
 six subjects with fl received bridging therapy between enrollment and lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
 new baseline scans were obtained after bridging treatment and before lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p>
 thirteen subjects (11 subjects with fl and 2 subjects with mzl) were retreated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 these subjects are included in the retreatment analysis set. the outcome of retreatment for these subjects 
 is not part of the main inferential analysis and is analysed separately. (for the retreated patients the safety 
 profile was similar to that observed for the main analysis.) 
 as of the data cutoff date, 18 subjects (14 subjects with fl and 4 subjects with mzl) who received 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel had died. one additional subject with fl who received axicabtagene ciloleucel was 
 removed from the study due to investigator decision and ultimately died. 
 for the 124 subjects with fl who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, the median actual study follow-up time 
 was 20.34 months (range: 0.3 to 37.7 months); 91 of 127 subjects (73%) had a potential study follow-up 
 time of at least 18 months.</p></section><section><header>table 16: demographics (safety analysis set)</header><p>ema/622447/2022

 8.0 to 40 days) for subjects with fl. the median duration in the intensive care unit was 6 days for subjects 
 with fl (range: 2 to 24 days).</p></section><section><header>adverse events</header><p>the overall summary of aes at the 18 months cutoff is displayed in table 19.</p><p>as of the data cutoff date, 3 subjects with fl (2%) who received axicabtagene ciloleucel had died due to

 events resolved within 3 weeks after the infusion for 41 subjects (59%) and within 8 weeks after the 
 infusion for 54 subjects (77%). among the 67 subjects with fl whose neurologic events had resolved, the 
 median duration of neurologic events was 14.0 days (range: 1 to 452 days). three subjects with fl had 
 neurologic events that were present beyond study day 200 as follows: 
 -</p><p>two subjects had grade 1 tremor from day 94 to day 262 and day 19 to day 369, respectively 
 (both events were deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel). 
 - one subject had grade 1 hypoesthesia from day 452 to day 456 that was deemed unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel.</p><p>there were 11 subjects with fl who had neurologic events that occurred &gt; 30 days but &lt; 200 days after 
 the axicabtgene ciloleucel infusion. all of these neurologic events were grade 1 except for the events of 
 grade 2 amnesia and grade 2 confusional state in 1 fl subject.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. cytopenias</header><p>among subjects with fl, 91 subjects (73%) had any cytopenia aes, and 86 subjects (69%) had worst grade 3 or higher cytopenia aes. 79 subjects (64%) had neutropenia aes of any grade, and 75 subjects 
 (60%) had worst grade 3 or higher neutropenia aes. forty-four subjects (35%) had thrombocytopenia aes 
 of any grade, and 29 subjects (23%) had worst grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia aes. forty-four 
 subjects (35%) had anemia aes of any grade, and 29 subjects (23%) had worst grade 3 or higher anemia 
 aes. 
 the number of subjects with fl who had worst grade 3 or higher prolonged neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
 and anemia aes (that were present on or after day 30 following the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on day 
 0) were 34 subjects (27%), 13 subjects (10%), and 8 subjects (6%), respectively. the duration of 
 cytopenias was calculated for subjects whose events had resolved. the mean (standard deviation) and 
 median (range) times to onset of cytopenias were 16.7 (51.7) and 3.0 (1 to 325) days after axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel infusion, respectively. the median duration of cytopenias were 27.0 (range: 1 to 769) days.</p><p>ema/622447/2022

 in the fl patients, there were 9 secondary malignancies identified: squamous cell carcinoma (2 subjects), 
 malignant anorectal neoplasm and secondary anal/rectal cancer (1 subject), and myelodysplastic syndrome 
 (mds), malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, acute bilineal leukemia, and prostate cancer (1 subject 
 each). in addition, there was 1 subject whose death was flagged as due to secondary malignancy; this 
 subject died due to acute myeloid leukemia after having partially withdrawn consent from the study and 
 having agreed to be followed for survival. the events of acute bilineal leukemia and mds were deemed 
 related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p>
 immunogenicity 
 subjects were tested for immunogenicity. in the fl patients, based on an initial screening assay, 14 subjects 
 were antibody-positive at baseline and 14 of the 123 tested subjects (11%) had a positive antibody test 
 result at any time point. samples from all 14 subjects were sent for confirmatory testing via a cell-based

 and summarized here.</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 76/102</p><p> as of 17 october 2020, 789 subjects have been exposed to axicabtagene ciloleucel in company sponsored interventional clinical trials. during the reporting period (18 april 2020 to 17 october 2020) approximately 
 43 subjects were administered axicabtagene ciloleucel in company sponsored clinical trials. in the 
 postmarketing setting, cumulative exposure to axicabtagene ciloleucel was approximately 3666 patients as 
 of 17 october 2020. during the reporting period, approximately 858 patients were administered 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel in the postmarketing setting. 
 during the reporting period 18 april 2020 to 17 october 2020, the axicabtagene ciloleucel company core 
 data sheet was updated twice. the first update, on 13 may 2020, included opportunistic infection data that 
 further characterizes the known axicabtagene ciloleucel risk infections. in addition, the crs and neurologic 
 toxicity grading and management guidances were revised and the 9-month interim data from zuma-5 were 
 added. the second update, on 24 july 2020, included the 12-month primary analysis data from zuma-5. 
 these updates will be incorporated into product information globally. 
 no significant safety issues for axicabtagene ciloleucel emerged following the commercialization of this 
 product, and the overall benefit-risk evaluation for axicabtagene ciloleucel continues to be positive.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.1">2.6.1.  
 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety database included 124 fl patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in the zuma-5 trial. the initial analysis cutoff date is march 12, 2020, which represents the 12 months follow-up data. additional 
 safety data were provided from the follow-up analysis 1, with a data cutoff date of 14 september 2020. 
 this prespecified analysis was performed when at least 80 subjects with fl had had the opportunity to be 
 followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (the median actual study follow-up time was 
 20.34 months, range: 0.3 to 37.7 months; 73% had a potential study follow-up time of at least 18 months). 
 for this assessment report, mostly the data from the 18 months follow-up were used. yet the 18 months 
 follow up is still considered rather short.</p><p>
 essentially, the aes and risks are similar to what has been described for other car t cell therapies and for 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications. no further risks and aes could be identified which would be 
 specific for axicabtagene ciloleucel or for the indication to be treated with kte-x19. the toxicity 
 management plans are presented in the smpc and are in line with the general management plans for this 
 product class. 
 the 
 important 
 identified 
 risks 
 (crs, 
 neurologic 
 events, 
 cytopenias, 
 infections, 
 and 
 hypogammaglobulinemia) were largely reversible and manageable with supportive care and medical 
 interventions.</p><p>
 in general, a lower incidence of crs (78%) and worst grade 3 crs (6%) was observed in the fl patients 
 in the zuma-5 study (vs. 93% and 9%, respectively, in patients with aggressive lymphoma; zuma-1 phase 
 1 and phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2, zuma-9 cohort 1, and zuma-12). this aspect could be attributed to the 
 indolent type of the disease, but also the increased awareness in the clinical sites and the experience in 
 treating crs patients.</p><p>
 in addition, the number of patients with neurologic aes (56%) and worst grade 3 or higher neurologic aes 
 (15%) in the fl patients in the zuma-5 study seems to be a bit lower than what is known for this drug 
 class (vs. 68% and 31%, respectively, in patients with aggressive lymphoma; zuma-1 phase 1 and phase 
 2 cohorts 1 and 2, zuma-9 cohort 1, and zuma-12). however, six subjects with fl had grade 1 or 2 
 neurologic events with an onset &gt; 80 days after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, 2 of which were 
 deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. there were 11 subjects with fl who had neurologic events that 
 occurred &gt; 30 days but &lt; 200 days after the axicabtgene ciloleucel infusion. all of these neurologic events</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 77/102</p><p> were grade 1 except for the events of grade 2 amnesia and grade 2 confusional state in 1 fl subject. three subjects with fl had neurologic events that were present beyond study day 200, two of which were 
 deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. therefore, there might be a tendency for late neurotoxicity in 
 this setting. the mah was requested to provide further analysis on the potential causes of such late 
 toxicities, and to provide an in-depth analysis of late neurotoxicity incidence across all patients treated with 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel. the analysis provided did not identify a consistent 
 pattern in either the time to onset or common etiology for these neurologic events. it is considered though 
 unlikely, that the toxicity from previous lines of chemotherapy would cause these late neurotoxicites, as 
 alluded to by the mah. nonetheless, the mah should further explore this in the future. it is agreed that the 
 smpc does not need to be modified at this stage, as the late neurotoxicities were reported as low grade 
 toxicities.</p><p>
 among the important potential risks, no secondary malignancies were attributed to axicabtagene ciloleucel, 
 no confirmed cases of immunogenicity were identified, no subjects tested positive for rcr, no cases of tls 
 or gvhd were identified.</p><p>
 there was a slight tendency toward a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia (14% vs 27%), worst 
 grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related aes (52% vs 65%), infections (47% vs 59%), and worst 
 grade 3 or higher infections (10% vs 24%) in females. this trend was already observed for axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel in the previous indication; however, no potential causes were identified so far, and seems to occur 
 irrespective of the indication.</p><p>
 compared with subjects who had relapsed, subjects with refractory disease showed a trend toward a higher 
 incidence of axicabtagene ciloleucel-related saes (23% vs 35%) and serious crs (5% vs 15%). 
 additionally, compared with subjects who were not in the double refractory subgroup, subjects in the double 
 refractory subgroup showed a trend towards a higher incidence of saes (42% vs 56%), axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel-related saes (24% vs 47%), worst grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related saes (18% 
 vs 28%), and serious neurologic events (11% vs 25%). these aspects seem to be specific for these disease 
 subgroups and dependent of disease status.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.2">2.6.2.  
 conclusions on clinical safety</header><p>the important identified risks for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the fl indication are crs, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. there are some potential risks linked to the use of this

 crs and serious neurologic adverse reactions and provide guidance on 
 reporting these serious adverse reactions associated with yescarta.</p><p>
 rationale for the 
 additional risk 
 minimization activity 
 the hcp educational material will be provided at launch of the product and at 
 the time of updates in each member state and will highlight the risks of 
 yescarta and will help ensure that the hcps using yescarta are made aware of 
 the risks and will be able to monitor for them. the hcp educational material 
 will also help hcps ensure that they have access to a minimum of 1 dose of 
 tocilizumab prior to yescarta infusion. the treatment center must have access 
 to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. crs 
 is not commonly observed with most anti-cancer medications. therefore, 
 hcps may not be as experienced in managing these adverse reactions. crs 
 occurred in 93% of patients in zuma-1 phase 1 and phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2, 
 and 82% of patients in zuma-5. the median time to onset for crs was 2 
 days for patients in zuma-1 and 4 days for patients in zuma-5, whilst the 
 median time to onset for neurologic events was 5 days for patients in zuma-1 
 phase 1 and phase 2 cohorts 1 and 2, and 7 days for patients in zuma-5. 
 it is anticipated that hcp educational material will enhance early diagnosis 
 and proper evidence-based management of these events, including 
 information on when and how to use tocilizumab and/or steroids. the 
 expected result is improvement in the outcomes of or mitigating severe, 
 life-threatening, and fatal crs and/or neurologic adverse reactions.</p><p>
 target audience and 
 planned distribution 
 path 
 the hcp educational material targets hcps who are likely to prescribe 
 yescarta. the method of delivery of the hcp educational material is 
 determined on a member state basis to align with local clinical organization.</p><p> ema/622447/2022 
 page 88/102</p></section><section><header>hcp educational material</header><p>plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the

 criteria for success 
 the evaluation of the effectiveness of hcp educational material will include 
 the following: 
  evaluations of hcps’ understanding of the risks of yescarta by means of a prescriber survey. the objective of the prescriber survey is to 
 assess the prescribers’ understanding of the risks of yescarta. 
  to meet this objective, the prescriber survey will: o assess whether every prescriber received the hcp educational material. 
 o measure the prescribers’ understanding of known important identified risks associated with yescarta. 
 o assess whether prescribers understand how to identify and treat crs or serious neurologic adverse reactions. 
  a post-marketing registry will assess the incidence of serious neurologic adverse reactions and crs and will thus provide an 
 outcome measure of the effectiveness of the risk minimization 
 program. 
  a summary of all reported severe, life-threatening crs and serious neurologic adverse reactions with an analysis of aes outcomes and 
 treatment. this will be presented within periodic safety reports. 
 these activities will assess whether the hcp educational material is meeting 
 its objectives. if the conclusion is that it is not, kite pharma will discuss with

 easy and immediate patients’ access to information about the common 
 signs and symptoms of crs, and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
 will promote early medical attention and treatment that will help 
 mitigating the risks.</p><p>
 target audience and

 disease or condition</header><p>the agreed indication is: “yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (fl) after three or more lines of systemic therapy”. 
 fl is one of the second most common type of lymphomas representing about 10-20% of all nhl. the 
 clinical course of the disease is characterised by relapses, with progressively diminishing remission periods. 
 the majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stage (iii-iv according to ann arbor staging). one of 
 the characteristics of the fl immunophenotype is the expression on the surface of tumour cells of cd19, 
 which is a common target for different therapeutic modalities in patients with b-cell malignancies.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.2">3.1.2.  
 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>although newly diagnosed fl of low grade is an indolent disease and patients respond well to first-line chemoimmunotherapy, most of patients relapse and received several treatments with different mechanisms 
 of action in second and third line, including chemoimmunotherapy, immunomodulating agents and pi3k 
 inhibitors. for a small proportion of selected patients stem cell transplant (auto- or allo-sct) is an option. 
 after 3, 4, 5 and 6 lines of therapy the overall survival is respectively 1.1, 0.9, 0.6 and 0.5 years (batlevi 
 et al., 2020). the disease remains incurable and there is a risk of histologic transformation to high grade 
 nhl. an unmet need for therapeutic options with novel mechanisms of action and manageable toxicity, 
 especially in late lines of relapsed and/or refractory disease, is recognised in this late clinical setting.</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 main clinical studies</header><p>the main clinical study supporting this application is the single arm trial zuma-5 (kte-c19-105), a phase 2 multicenter study of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with relapsed/refractory indolent non-hodgkin 
 lymphoma (inhl), which is ongoing in the us. the study includes patients with two histological types of 
 indolent nhl (inhl): fl and marginal zone lymphoma (mzl). with regard to the indication r/r fl, only 
 subjects classified fl grade 1-3a have been included, since fl grade 3b is treated as de novo dlbcl.</p><p>the 
 results of the primary (cut-off date 12march 2020) and follow-up 18-month (cut-off date 14sept 2020), 
 and upon request, follow-up 24-month (cut-off date 31mar2021) analyses have been submitted.</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.  
 favourable effects</header><p>objective response rate (orr), defined as complete response (cr) plus partial response (pr) per lugano classification and central assessment, was 91% (95% ci; 82%, 96%) in fl subjects after 3 or more prior 
 lines of therapy (fas, leukapheresed patients). the cr rate was 79% in this population corresponding to 
 the intended indication. median dor is 38.6 months (95% ci: 24.7, ne)</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>the treatment benefit cannot be comprehensively and comparatively assessed as it was only studied in a single-arm trial.</p><p>
 the major initial uncertainty was related to the discrepancy in the number of patients with histologically 
 confirmed fl by local and retrospective central histopathological diagnosis. confirmation of fl by central 
 assessment in all subjects, relevant for the intended marketing authorisation, would be ideal situation. 
 however, the applicant’s approach to provide new sets of populations under consideration of a more recent 
 data cut-off date (31 march 2021), as required, and to revise the data sets for fas, ias and sas by 
 excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-fl (n=5 subjects), is considered acceptable, given that the 
 following revision of the gathered efficacy and safety results in the intended target population did not 
 indicate clinically significant changes. it is known from scientific literature that a reliable pathological 
 diagnosis of fl depends largely on size and quality of the tissue sample, and that discordant histological 
 findings across different biopsies are often observed.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>the aes reported are similar to what has been described for other car t cell therapies and for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications.</p><p>
 the most significant and frequently occurring adverse reactions were crs (77%), infections (59%) and 
 encephalopathy (47%). 
 serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. the most common serious adverse reactions 
 included encephalopathy (16%), unspecified pathogen infections (12%), crs (12%), bacterial infections 
 (5%), fever (4%), viral infection (4%) and thrombosis (3%).</p><p>
 the most common (≥5%) grade 3 or higher non-haematological adverse reactions included encephalopathy 
 (14%), unspecified pathogen infections (11%) and crs (6%).</p><p> ema/622447/2022

 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>the safety database included 124 fl patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in the zuma-5 trial. yet, the potential follow-up time of 18 months is still rather short. while this period would be enough to identify 
 the earlier and immediate aes, there are certain potential risks for which conclusive data could not be 
 obtained due to the limited follow-up time. therefore, aspects regarding secondary malignancies, 
 replication competent retrovirus analysis will be collected in the pass registry study for the long-term 
 follow-up. 
 the number of late neurologic toxicities gave additional uncertainties. similarly, the higher incidence of 
 toxicities in females remains an uncertainty for this product.</p></section><section><header n="3.6">3.6.

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>the observed high orr and cr rates supported by dor data designate that clinically meaningful benefit could be achieved at long term in the intended population of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (fl) 
 patients in 4l+ setting with poor prognosis and progressively increasing refractoriness to prior therapeutic 
 modalities.</p><p>
 the most important unfavourable effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a car t cell product in general are 
 crs, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia. generally these unfavourable 
 effects are either treatable or have a self-limiting course and are reversible. the potential serious 
 consequences of crs have been recognised and treatment algorithms have been developed that are still 
 being refined according to further experience. overall considering the life-threatening disease the safety 
 profile of kte-x19 seems to be acceptable for the target population. since the unfavourable effects are in 
 line with the experience made with this drug class, the identified uncertainties and limitations are of limited 
 relevance.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>while compelling orr and cr were reported and the depth of responses appears to be accompanied by their durability, uncertainty remains regarding the true magnitude of the effects, especially at long term, i. 
 e. after month 24. the currently limited follow-up does not allow to fully contextualise response data based 
 on pfs/os results. the safety database is considered sufficiently characterised due to data available in 
 other patient populations, the toxicity is manageable and no new safety signals have been reported.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.
