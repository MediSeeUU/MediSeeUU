 disease or condition</header><p>large b-cell lymphoma (lbcl) represents a subset of aggressive b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) and includes both diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) (including dlbcl not otherwise specified 
 [nos]) and high-grade b-cell lymphoma (hgbl).</p></section><section><header>state the claimed the therapeutic indication</header><p>axicabtagene ciloleucel is proposed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and high-grade b cell lymphoma (hgbl). 
 following the first round of responses to the rfsi, the mah modified the intended indication as follows: 
 yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) who 
 are refractory or have relapsed within 12 months from completion of first-line therapy.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 10/129</p></section><section><header>epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention</header><p>non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) comprises a heterogeneous group of cancers originating primarily in b lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, in t lymphocytes and natural killer cells. nhl is the most prevalent 
 hematological malignancy and is the seventh most common new cancer, accounting for 4% of all new 
 cancer cases and 3% of cancer related deaths in the us. in europe, nhl is the 12th most common new 
 cancer, accounting for 3% of all new cancer cases and 3% of cancer related deaths. 
 lbcl is an aggressive subset of b-cell nhl, representing 30% to 40% of nhl cases. the most common 
 lbcl subtype is dlbcl (including dlbcl not otherwise specified [nos]), which accounts for more than 
 80% of lbcl cases. in 2016, the world health organization (who) introduced hgbl as a new category 
 of lbcl. hgbl represents up to 13% of lbcl cases.</p></section><section><header>clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>lbcl subtypes include dlbcl nos (defined by exclusion of unique features and further divided according to cell of origin types, germinal center b cell [gcb] and activated b cell [abc]), and other 
 disparate dlbcl entities with unique clinical and pathological features such as primary dlbcl of the 
 central nervous system (cns); primary cutaneous dlbcl, leg type; epstein barr virus positive (ebv+) 
 dlbcl nos; ebv+ mucocutaneous ulcer; dlbcl associated with chronic inflammation; and t 
 cell/histiocyte-rich lbcl. lbcl also includes dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma (fl), but this 
 subtype is not included in the who 2016 categorization due to the classification being based on the 
 investigator’s assessment of the clinical history of fl and not solely on histopathology. hgbl comprises 
 2 subcategories: 1) hgbl with myc, bcl2, and/or bcl6 rearrangements, which is also known as 
 double- or triple-hit lymphoma and excludes fl or lymphoblastic lymphoma; and 2) hgbl nos, which 
 includes lbcl that are “high-grade” and would be previously characterized as b cell lymphoma 
 unclassifiable, and lack genetic features of double- or triple hit lymphomas.</p></section><section><header>management</header><p>the current standard of care for the first-line treatment of dlbcl is the chemotherapeutic regimen cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (chop) in combination with the anti-cd20 
 monoclonal antibody rituximab (r-chop). treatment with this regimen resulted in 5-year and 10-year 
 event-free survival (efs) rates of 47% and 35%, respectively, and 5-year and 10-year overall survival 
 (os) rates of 58% and 44%, respectively in patients 60 to 80 years of age. for patients 18 to 60 years 
 of age treated with r-chop, 3-year efs and os rates are 79% and 93%, respectively. while r-chop 
 has improved outcomes for patients with dlbcl overall, about 10% to 15% of patients have primary 
 refractory disease and a further 20% to 40% of patients have disease that relapses. 
 the optimal therapy for the first-line treatment of patients with hgbl has not been established. a dismal 
 prognosis has been reported for patients with hgbl treated with various chemoimmunotherapy 
 regimens, and there is no consensus whether regimens more intensive than r-chop are required. 
 retrospective data with more intensive regimens such as dose-adjusted rituximab plus etoposide, 
 doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (da-epoch-r) have shown benefit, and 
 have also been reported as first-line treatment for hgbl. a recent retrospective analysis suggests 
 rituximab plus etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (r-epoch) may 
 not improve survival outcomes compared with r-chop (4-year os rates of 49.6% and 54.5%, 
 respectively).</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 11/129</p><p>
 standard second-line therapy in the curative setting for lbcl is comprised of rituximab and platinum-containing salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy (hdt) and autologous stem 
 cell transplant (auto-sct) for those who are eligible. five-year efs rates of 46% and os rates of 53% 
 in patients with r/r nhl have been reported for subjects who received the definitive treatment (salvage 
 chemotherapy and hdt-auto-sct). the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully assessed for hgbl 
 due to conflicting data from several studies. 
 while hdt-auto-sct has curative potential, only half of patients respond to second-line salvage 
 chemotherapy and are able to proceed to auto-sct. other reasons for not undergoing hdt-auto-sct 
 include failure to mobilize cd34
 + stem cells for auto-sct, poor performance status, organ dysfunction, comorbidities, unresolved treatment-emergent toxicities, or age (hdt-auto-sct is typically only 
 recommended for patients younger than 60 to 70 years of age, depending on regional guidelines). 
 furthermore, disease progression can occur at any point preparing for or after auto-sct and an increased 
 risk of death is associated with auto-sct due to early transplant-related mortality. secondary 
 malignancies, including treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and treatment-related acute 
 myeloid leukemia, are also associated with hdt-auto-sct. 
 outcomes are particularly poor for patients who have primary refractory disease or early relapse after 
 first-line therapies; further, most of these patients are not eligible for transplant due to their 
 chemotherapy-resistant 
 disease. 
 published 
 objective 
 response 
 rates 
 (orrs) 
 to 
 second-line 
 chemotherapy in patients with refractory or early relapse disease range from 14% to 55%. for patients 
 who do not respond to salvage chemotherapy, a median os of 4.4 months has been reported in one 
 study. 
 outcomes are also poor for patients with higher second-line age-adjusted international prognostic index 
 (saaipi) scores. studies have reported significantly higher 3-year efs for patients with an saaipi of 0 
 or 1 factors compared with those who had 2 or 3 factors (40% versus 18%, respectively), and 
 significantly improved os and progression-free survival (pfs). a retrospective study demonstrated 4-
 year pfs rates for patients with low risk (0 factors), intermediate risk (1 factor), and high-risk (2 or 
 3 factors) saaipi of 70%, 39%, and 16%, respectively, and 4-year os rates of 74%, 49%, and 18%, 
 respectively. 
 more recently, 2 therapies were conditionally approved in the eu for treating transplant-ineligible 
 patients with r/r dlbcl, and although these new treatment options offer incremental improvements in 
 response rates for selective patients, neither therapy has demonstrated curative outcome. these 
 therapies are tafasitamab, an anti-cd19 antibody, in combination with lenalidomide, with conditional 
 approval based on results from a phase 2 study and polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate 
 comprising a monoclonal antibody against cd79b conjugated to monomethyl auristatin e, in combination 
 with bendamustine and rituximab, with conditional approval based on results from a phase 1b/2 study.</p><p>
 in summary, many patients do not benefit from current standard of care second-line therapy. although 
 higher risk is associated with disease that is refractory or relapses within 12 months of first-line 
 therapy, only 10% of all patients with r/r lbcl are estimated to have long-term survival following 
 auto-sct in the rituximab era. thus, a need remains for alternative second-line therapies, including 
 those with a mechanism of action independent of chemotherapy sensitivity.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.1">2.1.1.  
 about the product</header><p>axicabtagene ciloleucel is an anti-cd19 chimeric antigen receptor (car) t-cell product manufactured from a patient’s own t cells that are obtained by leukapheresis and transduced with a murine γ retroviral</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 12/129</p><p>
 vector to deliver an anti-cd19 car transgene, resulting in expression of the anti-cd19 car protein on the surface of the patient’s engineered t cells. these engineered t cells are then introduced back into 
 the patient via a single intravenous infusion and target the b cell marker, cd19. 
 the anti-cd19 car consists of a murine single-chain antibody fragment that specifically binds human 
 cd19; the partial extracellular domain (hinge) and complete transmembrane and intracellular signaling 
 domains of human cd28, a lymphocyte costimulatory receptor that plays an important role in optimizing 
 t-cell survival and function; and the cytoplasmic portion, including the signaling domain, of human cd3ζ, 
 a component of the t-cell receptor complex. after engagement of the anti-cd19 car with cd19+ target 
 cells, the car intracellular domains trigger a dual signaling cascade that leads to car t-cell activation, 
 proliferation, and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that recruit and activate 
 additional antitumor immune cells and results in tumor cell lysis. 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel has demonstrated the capacity to prolong survival as a third-line treatment for 
 heavily pretreated patients whose disease was refractory to second-line therapy, and may present a 
 favorable efficacy and tolerability profile as a second-line therapy. since patients with r/r lbcl who are 
 refractory to or relapse early after first-line chemotherapy may also be resistant to second-line or beyond 
 chemotherapy, they may benefit from receiving therapies such as car t-cell therapy that have different 
 mechanisms of action earlier in their treatment. thus, administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a 
 second-line therapy may result in further improvement in its efficacy and tolerability profile in patients 
 with disease that failed first-line therapy, and particularly for patients with prognostic factors indicating 
 they might respond poorly to second-line standard of care therapy (soct).</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.

 methods 
 subject samples were collected on the protocol-specified study visits (ie, treatment days 0, 1, 3, and 
 7, with days relative to the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel on treatment day 0; and on study days 
 50, 100, and 150 postrandomization, with days relative to the day of randomization on study day 0). 
 results were mapped to assessment time points that more accurately characterize pharmacokinetic 
 and pharmacodynamic profiles and associations with clinical outcomes after treatment rather than</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 14/129</p><p>
 after randomization to the study (ie, treatment days 0, 1, 3, and 7, weeks 2 and 4, and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 post-treatment).</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetic profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in blood was assessed by means of measuring 
 the presence, expansion, and persistence of anti-cd19 car t cells at multiple time points after cell 
 infusion. serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a validated quantitative 
 polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay for the measurement of levels of anti-cd19 car t cells. the 
 qpcr assay was based on the method developed by kochenderfer and colleagues {
 kochenderfer 2012
 , 
 kochenderfer 2015
 , 
 kochenderfer 2017a
 } and was further optimized and validated by the university of 
 rochester medical center, central laboratory services (university of rochester medical center, central 
 lab services).</p><p>
 the maximum observed number of anti-cd19 car t cells/μg (ie, peak anti-cd19 car t cells/μl), the 
 area-under-the-curve (auc) of the level of anti-cd19 car t cells from infusion to week 4 postinfusion 
 (auc
 0-28), time-to-peak for anti-cd19 car t cells, and the persistence of anti-cd19 car t cells over time in blood were determined for subjects with evaluable samples. due to the timing of samples 
 collected after infusion, the calculated values for peak, auc
 0-28, and time-to-peak are considered estimates. the lower limit of detection (the sensitivity of quantitative detection of car t-cell signal 
 above background at a level of precision acceptable for quantitation) was established at 1 anti-cd19 
 car t cell equivalent per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), and the lower limit of 
 quantification (lloq) was established at 8 to 110 cell equivalents per 100,000 pbmcs depending on 
 dna sample load. 
 analyses of the pharmacokinetics assessments were performed on samples from subjects randomized 
 to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel and who received at least 1 dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel (safety 
 analysis set).</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics results</header><p>anti-cd19 car t-cell levels in blood anti-cd19 car t cells were measurable in the peripheral blood of 162 evaluable subjects within the 
 first 28 days after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. the median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell level was 
 25.84 cells/μl (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μl) and median auc
 0-28 was 236.23 cells/μl•days (range: 0.00 to 1.65 × 10
 4 cells/μl•days). the median time-to-peak was calculated as 8 days (range: 2 to 233 days) (ie, 7 days after the day of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion). by month 3, median levels of anti-
 cd19 car t cells decreased towards baseline in evaluable subjects (0.35 cells/μl; range: 0.00 to 
 28.44 cells/μl) but were still detectable in 12 out of 30 evaluable subjects until 24 months post

 notes: nonresponders are defined as subjects experiencing best response of stable or progressive 
 disease. peak is defined as the maximum number of car t cells in blood measured after the 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. auc is defined as the auc in a plot of number of car t cells in blood 
 against scheduled visit from treatment day 0 to week 4 post-treatment. values of 0.001 in the y-axis 
 indicate values of zero. only subjects in axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included.</p><p>
 ongoing response among 154 evaluable subjects, 70 subjects were in ongoing response (defined as ongoing or complete or partial responses at data cutoff), 64 subjects had relapsed, and 20 subjects had no response.</p><p>
 comparable anti-cd19 car t-cell peak and auc
 0-28 levels were observed between subjects who were in ongoing response and subjects who had relapsed, while the values were lower in subjects with no 
 response. specifically, the median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell level was 29.68 cells/μl (range: 0.55 to 
 276.28 cells/μl) in subjects with ongoing response, 27.44 cells/μl (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μl) 
 for relapsed subjects, and 10.45 cells/μl (range: 0.09 to 622.50 cells/μl) in subjects with no response. 
 the p-value for the overall comparison of peak values was p = 0.0713. the median auc
 0-28 was 276.88 cells/μl•days (range: 4.02 × 10
 3, 3759.66 cells/μl•days) in subjects with ongoing response, 313.23 cells/μl•days (range: 0.00, 1.65 × 10

 }. levels of analytes (proinflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines, chemokines, effector 
 molecules, and angiogenesis and acute phase proteins) were evaluated in serum samples at multiple 
 time points. if the subject experienced a grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related toxicity 
 such as grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (crs) or neurologic event, one additional blood draw for 
 cytokines was to be taken at the time of the grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related toxicity 
 and upon resolution of the event. due to the timing of samples collected after infusion, the calculated 
 values for peak, auc, and time-to-peak are considered estimates. 
 levels of the following 29 serum analytes are presented: 
 • homeostatic/proliferative: interleukin (il)-2, il-7, and il-15 • inflammatory/immune-modulating: il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), il-2 receptor α (il-2rα), il-4, il-5, il-6, il-10, il-12 p40, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
 (gm-csf) 
 • chemokine: c-x-c motif chemokine (cxcl) 10 (also known as interferon [ifn]-γ -induced protein-10 (ip-10), il-8, il-17, monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 (also known as c-c motif 
 chemokine ligand [ccl]2), mcp-4, macrophage-derived chemokine (mdc), macrophage 
 inflammatory protein (mip)-1α, mip-1β, and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (tarc) 
 • immune effector: granzyme b, ifn-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α • acute phase proteins: c-reactive protein (crp), ferritin, and serum amyloid a (saa) • other analytes: intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (vcam)-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)

 0.27% of viable leukocytes (range: 0.02% to 32.18%). at month 3, the first time point at which b cells 
 were measured after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, 52 of 138 tested subjects had detectable b cells, 
 and the median b-cell level was 0.37% (range: 0.02% to 24.51%). with limited evaluable samples (n

 had undetectable b cells, but among the 7 subjects with detectable b cells, the median value was 
 4.02% (range: 0.04% to 23.00%). b cell recovery was clearer at month 9 with the majority of subjects

 association of csf pharmacodynamic parameters with neurologic events 
 levels of 40 analytes in the csf were evaluated for potential associations with grade of neurologic

 cd3
 − cells compared with those whose products had a lower percentage of cd3− cells. across all other product characteristic subgroups, the median best overall response of cr ranged from 
 59% to 76% and were generally consistent with the median best overall response of cr of 68% for the 
 overall population. 
 a possible trend towards higher ongoing response rate at data cutoff (55% versus 31%, respectively) 
 was observed for subjects whose products had a higher percentage (&gt; the median value) of t

 association of product characteristics and safety outcomes 
 preinfusion product characteristics were evaluated in subgroup analyses for the following treatment-
 emergent ae (teae) categories within the safety analysis set: all teaes, serious teaes, teaes and 
 serious teaes deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel, crs, neurologic events, serious neurologic 
 events, cytopenias by lineage (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia), infections, and serious 
 infections. 
 the following key trends were observed for associations of product characteristics with teaes of 
 interest: 
 • a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher crs was observed in subjects who received products that produced higher levels of ifn-γ (12% versus 1%, respectively). 
 • higher incidences of grade 3 or higher crs or neurologic events were observed in subjects who were infused with a higher total number of t
 em plus teff (ccr7−) cells (31% versus 14%) or products that produced higher levels of ifn-γ (33% versus 15%). 
 • higher incidences of grade 3 or higher neurologic events were observed in subjects who were infused with a higher total number of t
 em cells (27% versus 13%), a higher total number of tem plus teff (ccr7−) cells (30% versus 10%), or products that had a higher percentage of teff cells (27% versus 13%). 
 • higher incidences of grade 3 or higher serious neurologic events were observed in subjects who were infused with a higher total number of cd3 cells (19% versus 8%), a higher total number of 
 cd8 cells (19% versus 8%), a higher total number of t
 em plus teff (ccr7−) cells (22% versus 6%), or products that produced higher levels of ifn-γ (21% versus 9%).</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.  
 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results on axicabtagene ciloleucel measurables and clinical parameters on safety and efficacy are in line with current scientific knowledge on the pharmacology of 
 car t cells. the pharmacokinetic profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the zuma-7 trial presents a rapid 
 expansion of car t cells peaking on day 8 followed by a rapid contraction up to week 4 and subsequent</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 31/129</p><p>
 low level persistence up to 18 to 24 months, consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile observed in the other trials with these car-t cells. the median time-to-peak was 8 days for all subgroup populations. 
 car t-cell expansion was associated with efficacy endpoints, and the pharmacokinetic associations with 
 toxicity are consistent with previous observations with axicabtagene ciloleucel. there is no sex or age 
 related difference in the median time-to-peak of 8 days. in addition, the median peak anti cd19 car t-
 cell levels are similar and not influenced by age or sex. interestingly, there is no significant difference in 
 median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell levels and median time-to-peak between cd19 positive and negative 
 patients. 
 higher anti-cd19 car t-cell levels were associated with subjects who were responders compared with 
 subjects who were nonresponders. median anti-cd19 car t cell peak and auc0-28 were numerically 
 higher in subjects whose best response was cr compared with subjects whose best response was pr. 
 higher anti-cd19 car t-cell levels in blood were associated with grade 3 or higher neurologic events. 
 higher anti-cd19 car t-cell levels were observed in subjects who experienced grade 3 or higher crs. 
 quantification of serum analytes revealed a rapid and transient increase in several proinflammatory and 
 immune-modulatory analytes following infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, which is consistent with the 
 known mechanism of action of anti-cd19 car t-cell therapy. the median time-to-peak for 19 of 29 
 serum analytes was 8 days (ie, 7 days after the day of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion). the median 
 time-to-peak was 1 day for il-4; 2 days for gm-csf, il-2, il-7, il-15, il-17, mcp-1, and mip-1β; 4 
 days for saa; and 5 days for mcp-4. by week 4 post-treatment, the majority of the serum analytes had 
 returned to near baseline levels. of the 29 serum analytes, the peak levels for the following analytes 
 were nominally higher (nominal wilcoxon rank sum p ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced grade 3 
 or higher crs (n = 11) versus grade 2, grade 1, or no crs (n = 159) after infusion of axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel: cxcl10, ferritin, gm-csf, granzyme b, icam-1, il-2rα, il-6, il-10, il-15, il-17, mcp-1, and 
 vcam-1. of the 29 serum analytes, the peak levels for the following analytes were nominally higher 
 (nominal wilcoxon rank sum p ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced a grade 3 or higher neurologic 
 event (n = 36) versus grade 2, grade 1, or no neurologic event (n = 134) after infusion of axicabtagene

 higher among subjects who experienced grade 3 or higher neurologic event (n = 6) versus subjects who 
 experienced grade 2, grade 1, or no neurologic event (n = 7) after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 before lymphodepleting chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (baseline), b-cell levels were 
 generally low (possibly due to first-line therapy, r-chop) with median levels &lt; 1% of total leukocytes 
 (median = 0.27), but detectable in the majority of subjects (81 of 141 tested subjects). after 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, at month 3, b-cell levels were undetectable in most subjects (86 of 138

 rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel or soct. randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, 
 relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy, or relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and saaipi 
 (0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening. 
 for subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, treatment consisted of lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
 followed by a single intravenous infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. bridging therapy of corticosteroids 
 was allowed prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy for subjects with high disease burden, at the 
 discretion of the investigator. for subjects in the soct arm, treatment consisted of a single protocol-
 defined, platinum-based salvage chemotherapy regimen as selected by the treating investigator. 
 subjects who responded to salvage chemotherapy were to proceed to hdt with or without total body 
 irradiation (tbi), followed by auto-sct. 
 disease response and progression were evaluated per the lugano classification {
 cheson 2014
 }, by 
 blinded central assessment and by the investigator. subjects in both treatment arms were to be assessed 
 for response and progression at the same times relative to randomization (study day 0): study days 
 50, 100, 150, and month 9, then every 3 months thereafter until month 24, and then every 6 months 
 from months 30 to 60. for a subject who completed the long-term follow-up period, the study was to 
 take approximately 5 or 15 years to complete as determined by randomization to the soct or 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel arms, respectively. 
 the primary analysis of efs was conducted on the full analysis set (fas), defined as all randomized 
 subjects, and according to the randomized treatment regardless of whether study treatment was 
 received, when all subjects had the opportunity to be followed for the month 9 disease assessment (ie, 
 the month 9 timepoint had passed for all subjects) and 250 efs events by blinded central assessment 
 had been observed.</p></section><section><header>study participants</header><p>approximately 350 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or soct. randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, relapse ≤ 6 months

 discretion of the investigator for disease temporalization, but chemoimmunotherapy was not allowed as 
 bridging therapy because of possible disease-modifying effects that would confound the short- and 
 longterm disease assessments in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm. bridging therapy was to consist of 
 corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone at a dose of 20 to 40 mg or equivalent, either orally [po] or iv daily

 a hierarchical testing scheme of efs, followed by orr and then os (see “statistical methods” below). 
 overall 350 subjects were planned to be randomized (175 subjects per arm). 
 an efs hazard ratio (test/control arm) of 0.67 was hypothesized in the fas set, which corresponds to 
 a median efs of 4 versus 6 months (control vs test arm). the primary analysis was planned when 250 
 efs events had been observed; the study was been sized to achieve approximately 90% power at the 
 1-sided 2.5% significance level to detect a 50% improvement in efs. the efs analyses was planned 
 as event-driven and was to occur when the required number of events have been observed. 
 for the analysis of orr, response rates of 36% and 78% in the control and test arms were assumed. 
 orr was to be tested with a stratified (randomization factors) cochran-mantel-haenszel test at the 
 2.5% level among subjects with measurable disease at baseline.</p><p>
 an os hazard ratio of 0.73 was hypothesized in the fas set, which corresponds to a median os of

 first-line therapy (primary refractory, vs relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy vs relapse &gt; 6 and ≤

 data handling procedures were to be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the 
 validity and credibility of the study. these procedures were to be outlined in the study statistical 
 analysis plan and trial integrity document (tid). according to the tid, biostatisticians and 
 biostatistical programmers from the sponsor had access to the restricted data at all time. however, 
 access of the sponsor’s team to treatment allocation (and to corresponding variables such as choice of 
 standard of care treatment, leukapheresis, etc) was seemingly restricted with no exceptions for

 the primary efs analysis. additionally, the dsmb was to review safety and efficacy data at the time of</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 36/129</p><p>
 the planned interim efs analysis. the dsmb was tasked to also review sae information and susars on a regular basis throughout the study.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>analysis sets the primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints was to be conducted in the fas, defined as all randomized subjects according to the itt principle.</p><p>
 the safety analysis set was defined as the subset of all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
 dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel or standard of care chemotherapy and a safety asct analysis set was 
 defined as the subset of subjects randomized to the soct arm who underwent transplant as part of 
 protocol therapy. subjects were to be analyzed according to the treatment received. 
 the primary analysis of hrqol was to be performed on the subset of subjects in the fas who have a 
 baseline and at day 150 post-randomization assessment.</p><p>
 primary endpoint efs was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per lugano classification (cheson et al, 2014), commencement of new lymphoma therapy, or death from any 
 cause.</p><p>for the primary analysis of efs, disease progression events and censoring times were 
 determined by blinded central review. details for the definition of efs events and timing, and 
 censoring times were defined in the study protocol.</p><p>
 a stratified (randomization stratification factors) log-rank test was to be used for the primary 
 comparison of efs. additionally, stratified (randomization stratification factors) cox regression models 
 were to be used to provide the estimated efs hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to soct. the median efs time and event-free rates at 3-month 
 intervals were to be provided.</p><p>
 sensitivity analyses were to be performed using the actual stratification factor values, in which the 
 strata for relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy and relapse from 6 to 12 months of first-line therapy 
 were determined based on the time of completion of the first-line therapy (rather than time of 
 initiation</p></section><section><header>or</header><p> completion). further sensitivity analyses of efs were to be performed to assess ascertainment time bias in disease progression: progression events that occurred between scheduled 
 assessments were to be moved forward to the next schedule assessment after / before the observed 
 progression, and efs events that occurred after more than one missed visit were to be censored at the 
 last evaluable disease assessment or visit prior to the observed progression. additionally, a sensitivity 
 analysis in which subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm who underwent sct while in an 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel induced response were to be considered to have had an efs event on the date 
 of sct. efs based on investigator disease assessments was to be analyzed with the same methods as 
 efs.</p><p>
 key secondary endpoints orr was defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a partial response by the lugano classification (cheson et al, 2014) as determined by blinded central review. all subjects who did not 
 meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cutoff date were to be considered non-
 responders. disease assessments obtained after randomization and up to an observation of 
 progression per lugano classification were to be used. derivation of best response was to include all</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 37/129</p><p>
 assessments until an efs event, including any assessments obtained after sct for the soct arm. testing of orr was to be performed with a stratified (randomization factor) cochran-mantel-haenszel 
 test for the common odds ratio of response. an exact binomial 2-sided 95% confidence interval was to 
 be generated for the objective response rates and best response rates for each treatment arm. 
 wilson’s score method with continuity correction will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for 
 the difference in objective response rates between treatment arms (newcombe 1998). 
 os was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. subjects who have not died 
 by the analysis data cutoff date were to have survival time censored at their last date known to be 
 alive. for subjects alive or dead after the data cutoff date, survival time was to be censored at the 
 data cutoff date. a stratified (randomization stratification factors) log-rank test was to be used for the 
 primary comparison of os. additionally, a stratified (randomization factor) cox regression model was 
 to be used to provide the estimated os hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>
 multiplicity control (over endpoints) to preserve the overall significance level, statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints was to follow a hierarchical scheme (see also figure 4). efs was to be tested first at the 
 primary efs analysis. conditional on a statistically significant improvement in efs, orr was to be 
 tested at the 2.5% level at the time of the primary efs analysis. conditional on a statistically 
 significant improvement in efs and orr, os was be tested up to 3 times at an overall 1-sided alpha 
 level of 2.5% (see description of interim analyses below).</p></section><section><header>figure 4. study testing scheme</header><p>interim analyses one interim analysis of efs and 2 interim analyses of os were planned.</p><p>the interim efs analysis was for futility and was to occur when 135 efs events had been observed. an

 null hypothesis, the probability of stopping for futility at this interim analysis was approximately 60%.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 38/129</p><p>
 the required 135 efs events were anticipated to occur approximately 19 months after the first subject was randomized. the primary analysis of efs was to be conducted when all randomized subjects had 
 had the opportunity to be followed to the month 9 disease assessment and 250 efs events as 
 determined by blinded central review had been observed. if more than 250 efs events were observed 
 at the time of the data cutoff for the primary analysis, all observed events were to be used in the 
 analysis. prior to the primary efficacy analysis, modeling and monitoring of cumulative efs events was 
 to be performed to determine a data cutoff date to achieve the planned analysis target event goal. 
 conditional upon statistically significant tests of efs and orr, testing of os was to be performed. two 
 interim analyses of os were to occur, a first at the time of the primary efs analysis and a second 
 when approximately 160 deaths had been observed or no later than 4 years after the first subject was 
 randomized. a spending function of the rho family (kim &amp; demets 1987) with parameter (rho = 6) was 
 to be used to allocate the alpha between the 2 interim analyses of os and the primary analysis of os. 
 approximately 110 os events were anticipated at the time of the interim os analysis 1, and 160 at the 
 time of the second os interim. the primary analysis of os was to occur when approximately 210 
 deaths have been observed or no later than 5 years after the first subject is randomized. the protocol 
 stated that, based on the alpha spending function and projected event rates, alpha was to be allocated 
 as 0.1% (ia1), 0.4% (ia2), and 2% for the primary analysis of os. notably, this is not in line with the 
 defined spending function, which would have led to an allocation of 0.05% (ia1), 0.5% (ia2), and 
 2.4% (primary analysis).</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 39/129</p></section><section><header>results participant flow</header><p>abbreviations: ae, adverse event; alt, alanine aminotransferase; auto-sct, autologous stem cell transplant; cva, cerebrovascular accident; fas, full analysis set; hdt, high-dose therapy; pd, progressive disease; pet-ct, positron emission tomography – computed

 protocol was amended 5 times. however, no subjects were treated until amendment 2 (dated 21 
 november 2017) and therefore, changes made before and in amendment 2 are not provided here. 
 amendment 3 was not submitted to any irbs or ecs, as well as any ex-us health authorities (ha); 
 therefore, all changes made in amendment 3 and amendment 4 were implemented in, and described 
 below under, amendment 4. major changes after protocol amendment 4 and for all subsequent 
 amendments are also summarized below. amendment 5 was submitted to and approved by has, irbs 
 and ecs outside of the us; no subjects were enrolled under this amendment in the us. amendment 5.1 
 was subsequently submitted to and approved by the fda and irbs/ecs in the us. 
 amendment 4: 19 march 2019 • broadened the definition of the time point from which the period of relapse is determined for the stratification factors from “relapse ≤ 6 months of initiating first-line therapy” and “relapse &gt; 6 
 and ≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to “relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy” and 
 “relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation 
 or completion of first-line therapy. 
 • broadened the definition of the time point from which progression is determined for the inclusion sub-criterion “partial response (pr) as best response after at least 6 cycles and biopsy-proven 
 residual disease or disease progression” from “≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to “≤ 
 12 months of first-line therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation or completion of first-
 line therapy. 
 • broadened the definition of the time point from which the period of relapse is determined for the inclusion sub-criterion “relapsed disease defined as complete remission to first-line therapy 
 followed by biopsy-proven disease relapse” from “≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to 
 “≤ 12 months of firstline- therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation or completion of 
 first-line therapy. 
 • updated the inclusion criteria to maintain alignment with the who lymphoid malignancy categories, wherein changes made in 2016 led to the recognition of dlbcl subtypes of t-
 cell/histiocyte-rich large b-cell lymphoma, ebv+ dlbcl, and primary cutaneous dlbcl, leg type 
 as unique entities and the hgbl category was created {swerdlow 2016}. therefore, inclusion 
 criteria were updated from dlbcl including transformation from fl to lbcl including dlbcl, 
 nos; hgbl with or without myc and bcl2 and/or bcl6 rearrangement; dlbcl arising from fl; 
 t-cell/histiocyte-rich large b-cell lymphoma; dlbcl associated with chronic inflammation; 
 primary cutaneous dlbcl, leg type; and ebv+ dlbcl.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 41/129</p><p>
 • clarified the required duration of subject observation after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion was to be aligned with country-specific requirements.</p><p>
 • aligned requirements for initiating leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and retreatment with the axicabtagene ciloleucel clinical study program. 
 • clarified the duration of the period for collecting information for concomitant therapy was to include targeted concomitant therapies from study day 150 until month 12, and that recording 
 of this information stopped at month 12, change in lymphoma therapy, or disease progression, 
 whichever came first. 
 • updated that pet-cts were to continue through month 9 or until a change in lymphoma therapy or disease progression, whichever came first. clarified that imaging follow-up was to be 
 performed for subjects who discontinued protocol therapy due to an assessment of pd, but for 
 whom there was no change in lymphoma therapy. clarified that subjects for whom ct scans with 
 contrast were contraindicated were to undergo mri with contrast in addition to noncontrast ct 
 scans. 
 • clarified that samples of apheresis and final product were to be retained and tested to understand the mechanism of action and safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 • updated the soa tables (for both treatment arms) to include respiratory rate as a vital sign procedure and the wpai:gh was added to the therapy days –5 and 0 assessments to align with 
 collection of the other pros. the axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment arm soa was updated with 
 an additional blood draw for pbmcs at treatment day 3 and the mini-mental state examination 
 was removed as a mandatory part of the neurologic assessment. the soct arm soa table was 
 updated with additional blood draws at cycle 1 and study days 50, 100, and 150 and for long-
 term follow-up assessments at months 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60. 
 • added 3 timepoints for pro assessment (months 18, 21, and 24) to the long-term follow-up</p><p>• updated the ae reporting period to post-randomization through study day 150 or a change in lymphoma therapy, whichever occurred first 
 • updated the sae reporting period to after signing of the informed consent through the study day 150 visit or until initiation of a new lymphoma therapy, whichever occurred first. the 
 reporting period for targeted saes was updated to 5 years for the soct arm and 15 years for 
 the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, or until disease progression, whichever occurred first.</p><p>
 • described the reporting requirements for deaths to match the current axicabtagene ciloleucel clinical study program 
 amendment 5 (current protocol version for ex-us has and irbs/ecs): 25 june 2020 • modified the primary efs analysis event trigger from 270 to approximately 250 efs events with an acceptable lower limit for the observed total efs events of 225, which was to maintain the 
 power for the primary analysis to within 5% of the targeted 90%. 
 • increased the required duration of follow-up for the primary analysis of efs from the study day 150 assessment to the month 9 assessment 
 • added a second interim os analysis and a sensitivity analyses of os. the second interim analysis of os was to occur when approximately 160 deaths have been observed or no later than 4 years 
 after the first subject is randomized. the sensitivity analyses were added to address the 
 confounding effect from treatment switching. 
 • added a time frame for the primary analysis of os so that it was to occur either when approximately 210 deaths have been observed or no later than 5 years after the first subject 
 was randomized.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 42/129</p><p>
 • added ttnt as an exploratory endpoint • provided guidance for sites to encourage collection of a biopsy confirming disease progression and to submit the biopsied tissue to the central laboratory 
 • updated the revised pregnancy and lactation reporting language to be consistent with eu requirements and to align across kite programs 
 • clarified the teae definition as any ae that begins on or after the first dose study treatment (axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or standard of care salvage chemotherapy), to be in alignment 
 with the definition used in other kite studies.</p><p>
 amendment 5.1 (us only): 16 september 2020 • reference to an acceptable lower limit for the observed total efs events to trigger the primary analysis was removed at the request of the fda 
 • removed “approximately” from the 250 events required to trigger the primary analysis at the request of the fda 
 changes in planned analyses 
 the following changes in analyses or additional analyses occurred after sap finalization: 
 • the primary efs analysis was planned to occur after 250 efs events had been observed in the study. because the time to reach 250 efs events was longer than estimated, the first interim 
 os analysis was conducted at 153 events instead of the planned 110 events. as a result, the 
 interim os analysis conducted at 153 events meets the criteria for both originally planned interim 
 os analyses at 110 and 160 events. the only subsequent planned os analysis will be the primary 
 (final) os analysis, expected to occur when 210 events are observed or no later than 5 years 
 after the first subject is randomized. 
 • pfs based on central assessment was analyzed with the same methods per investigator assessment, as well as in subgroups defined by the baseline characteristics in section 7.7.10.2. 
 and presented in data tables. 
 • modifications within some categories of baseline characteristics and subgroup covariates occurred. 
 • hdt-related teaes (for the soct arm) are provided in data tables in addition to the sap-specified salvage chemotherapy-related and auto-sct-related teae tables. 
 the following clarifications to definitions were made after sap finalization: 
 • concordance between efs determined by central and investigator assessment was determined using efs events instead of progression events. 
 • therapy day 0 is used in select data tables and listings in the following instances: o when referring to the day of administration of the first dose of salvage chemotherapy in the soct arm 
 o in tables, listings, and narratives that use one term to refer to the day of administration of the first dose of either axicabtagene ciloleucel in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm or 
 salvage chemotherapy in the soct arm.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 43/129</p><p>

 inadequate samples or sample types, or lack of clinical history such as the location of the tumor) were 
 considered by the central laboratory to be dlbcl without further classification of subtype possible. 
 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct arms were categorized as dlbcl nos/without further

 refractory disease were derived from the clinical database (133 subjects [74%] and 132 subjects [74%] 
 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct arms, respectively) but the percentages of subjects whose 
 disease relapsed ≤ 6 months or &gt; 6 to ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy differed between the ixrs and 
 the derived data due to a protocol change that broadened the definition of the time point from which the 
 period of relapse is determined.</p><p>

 all randomized subjects had the opportunity to be followed for at least 15 months after randomization. 
 the median potential follow-up time (from randomization to the data cutoff date) was 24.94 months

 at the time of the data cutoff (18 march 2021), 252 efs events by blinded central assessment had 
 occurred for 108 subjects (60%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 144 subjects (80%) in the soct 
 arm.</p><p>
 axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment was superior to soct, with a stratified hr of 0.398 (95% ci: 0.308, 
 0.514; stratified log-rank p &lt; 0.0001). the km median efs time for the axicabtagene ciloleucel and

 soct arm.</p><p>
 the primary analysis of efs used the stratification factors as collected via ixrs at randomization. 
 sensitivity analyses of efs using stratification factors derived from the ecrf and efs without

 the most common efs events in either the axicabtagene ciloleucel or soct arm were disease 
 progression (82 subjects [46%] and 75 subjects [42%], respectively), new lymphoma therapy (9 
 subjects [5%] and 63 subjects [35%], respectively), and death from any cause (11 subjects [6%] and 
 6 subjects [3%], respectively).</p><p>
 at the data cutoff date, 72 subjects (40%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 35 subjects (20%) in

 in the fas were censored before month 12.</p><p>
 twelve subjects (2 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 10 in the soct arm) initiated a new lymphoma 
 therapy in the absence of an evaluable postbaseline disease assessment and had efs event dates

 notes: therapies taken during retreatment period in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included.</p><p>
 in table above, percentages represent subject incidences for each therapy, regardless of lines of therapy that each subject received, and if multiple therapies are included in the line of therapy, each line of 
 therapy can be counted in &gt; 1 category (eg, if salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy 
 [hdt]+auto-sct is considered a line of therapy per investigator, it is counted under both 
 chemo[immune]therapy and hdt+auto-sct). 
 overall, 38% of patients received chemo(immuno)therapy as any line of subsequent therapy, while 29% 
 received this therapy as the first subsequent therapy after axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 data collection for subjects who received subsequent therapies was limited and did not include collection 
 of scheduled disease assessments. subsequent therapies were not protocol-defined and, after new 
 lymphoma therapy, disease assessments were not required at regular intervals (as was for on-protocol 
 therapy) and were per standard of care and investigator discretion. 
 therefore, efficacy analyses for the 29% of subjects (n = 53) who received chemo(immuno)therapy as 
 the first subsequent therapy after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion are limited to orr, cr, time-to-
 next therapy, and the percentage who proceeded to hdt-asct (13%; n = 7) and are summarized in 
 table below. efs and progression-free survival (pfs) are not provided because there were no scheduled 
 disease assessments after a subject received a new lymphoma therapy, which was received off-protocol, 
 and the date of the last evaluable disease assessment could not be obtained for efs and pfs censoring.</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 76/129</p></section><section><header>table 13. subsequent chemo(immuno)therapy and transplant in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm of zuma-7 (full analysis set, n = 180)</header><p>axicabtagene ciloleucel</p><p> (n = 180)

 therapy) to the start of the next subsequent lymphoma therapy (not including transplant immediately following 
 chemo(immuno)therapy) or death from any cause. subjects who did not receive subsequent lymphoma therapy after

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>zuma-7 is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel versus soct in adult subjects with r/r lbcl. adult subjects with r/r lbcl after first-line 
 rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel or soct. randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, 
 relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy, or relapse &gt; 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and saaipi 
 (0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening.</p><p>
 the stratification factor for response to first line therapy was modified in the conduct of study with 
 amendment 4 and was changed from time since initiation of first line therapy to time since initiation or 
 completion of first line therapy. the inclusion factor for response to first line therapy was modified in 
 the same way. this led to an inclusion criterion and a stratification factor, which were not well-defined 
 after amendment 4. this change was justified by differing definitions of early relapsed disease in the 
 literature and the fact that also subjects with refractory or progressive disease within 12 months after 
 completion of therapy have a poor prognosis. neither of these two reasons provide a strong or 
 compelling reason to implement such a change in an ongoing, open-label trial, which is hence not 
 endorsed. upon request the applicant clarified that this broadened definition of early relapsed disease</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 84/129</p><p>
 lead to the inclusion of only 16 additional subjects (4.5% of the total sample size). on the one hand this makes the necessity of broadening the inclusion criterion somewhat questionable, on the other 
 hand it shows that the impact is likely to be minor. this was further substantiated by sensitivity 
 analyses, which were provided upon request. they show that the treatment effect was only marginally 
 impacted. at the same time they all indicate that the treatment benefit for os and efs in subjects who 
 relapsed or were refractory after 12 months from initiation of 1l therapy was smaller compared to 
 subjects who relapsed or were refractory before 12 months from initiation of 1l therapy. to 
 substantiate that a treatment benefit for subjects with later relapse/refractory disease is still present 
 additional subgroup analyses were requested. 
 for subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, treatment consisted of lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
 followed by a single intravenous infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. bridging therapy of corticosteroids 
 was allowed prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy for subjects with high disease burden, at the 
 discretion of the investigator. for subjects in the soct arm, treatment consisted of a platinum-based 
 salvage chemotherapy regimen as selected by the treating investigator from several protocol defined 
 options. subjects who responded to salvage chemotherapy were to proceed to hdt with or without tbi, 
 followed by auto-sct. the treatment scheme in the soct arm is in line with the current esmo gl, which 
 recommends salvage regimens with rituximab and chemotherapy followed by hdt and asct. the 
 salvage chemotherapy regimens used represent current medical practice. 
 the primary objective was to determine if axicabtagene ciloleucel is superior to soct as measured by 
 efs, as determined by blinded central assessment. 
 key secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with soct on 
 orr (determined by blinded central assessment), os, pfs (determined by investigator assessment), 
 and dor and duration of cr among responding subjects (determined by blinded central assessment), 
 and to evaluate the safety and effect of pros and qol of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with soct. 
 the analysis of efs, orr and os was controlled for multiplicity using a hierarchical approach.</p><p>
 the analysis of os followed a group sequential design (i.e., with interim analyses), which was modified 
 multiple times throughout the study. the first interim analysis was planned at the time the efs analysis, 
 which was initially assumed to happen after 140 os events. with amendment 5 (25 june 2020)</p><p>this 
 interim analysis was assumed to happen after 110 os events and a second interim analysis after 160 
 os events was introduced. in parallel the alpha-spending function was changed from an o’brien-fleming 
 spending function to a kim-demets spending function. the changes were justified by the lower number 
 of expected os events by the time of the efs analysis and by the wish to reserve sufficient alpha for the 
 final analysis in order to maintain the overall power for os, which is considered comprehensible. nominal 
 significance levels were defined in the protocol as well, but did not match the alpha spending function 
 (see statistical methods for details). at the time of the first interim analysis (18 march 2021) the second 
 interim analysis was dropped again as 153 events had accrued by that time. upon request the mah 
 clarified that the kim-demets alpha spending function (with ρ = 6) and one interim analysis after 153 
 os evens (if = 73%) and a final analysis planned at 210 events is to be used. this leaves α = 2.44% 
 for the final analysis. in principle this is considered acceptable. however, given the uncertainties in the 
 definition of the alpha spending function and significance levels to be applied and the post hoc nature of 
 this decision, this is considered to add uncertainties with respect to the robustness of the os analyses. 
 a type 1 error inflation cannot be fully excluded. 
 the study was open-label, which is endorsed given the different treatment (and manufacturing) 
 profiles, where blinding would have been infeasible. a dsmb was installed for safety (and efficacy)</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 85/129</p><p>
 reviews and a trial integrity document (tid) was in place to detail the access to (restricted) data, which is in principle endorsed as well.</p><p>
 it can be seen from the tid, however, that not only monitors had access to subject level or 
 aggregated data but that operations managers, statistical programmers and biostatisticians had 
 access, the latter to full access at any time. seemingly the access to treatment allocation was 
 restricted for all sponsor’s personnel, and statisticians involved in the protocol changes were not 
 identical to the study team biostatisticians/programmers and had no access to the zuma-7 study data. 
 however, no clearly defined firewall was in place to separate individuals involved in the monitoring of 
 the study from individuals involved in the conduct of the study. this is considered problematic as it 
 cannot be excluded that changes have been made in the light of the accruing data (i.e., post hoc with 
 an unknown and unquantifiable impact on the results especially for os). upon request, the mah 
 clarified that no analyses by treatment arm were conducted prior to the primary efs analysis and that 
 the decisions were not made in the light of accruing data. 
 a total of 359 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or soct, 
 with 180 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 179 subjects in the soct arm.</p><p>
 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm 178 patients underwent leukapheresis, 65 patients received bridging 
 therapy, 172 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and 170 patients received axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel. 
 while more male and younger subjects were enrolled, the distribution across the two treatment arms 
 are similar. the distribution of patients across baseline and disease characteristics was similar in both 
 arms. while the distribution between the two treatment arms is similar here as well, the molecular 
 subgrouping seems to be slightly different compared to the general dlbcl population: 61% gcb and 
 9% abc (55%-5% in the soct arm), whereas in the literature there is a prevalence of 50% vs ~35-
 40% for these subtypes. this means a relative underrepresentation of the abc subtype, although this is 
 similarly present in both treatment arms.</p><p> 
 for the 180 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and the 179 subjects in the soct arm, the 
 median potential follow-up time was 25.00 months (range: 17.48 to 37.75 months) and 24.84 months 
 (range: 17.58 to 37.26 months), respectively; and the median actual follow-up time was 20.07 months 
 (range: 0.59 to 37.75 months) and 18.23 months (range: 0.03 to 37.26 months), respectively.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the primary objective of the study was met: at the primary efs analysis, axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of an efs event compared with soct 
 (stratified hr = 0.398 [95% ci: 0.308, 0.514]; stratified log-rank p &lt; 0.0001). 
 these efs data provide compelling arguments in favour of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the patient 
 population studied. importantly, there seem to be no difference in efficacy for sex, and also both age 
 groups below and above 65 years benefitted from the therapy.</p><p>
 of note, efs events were imputed as the randomization date (in case of the initiation of a new lymphoma 
 therapy in the absence of any evaluable disease assessment). given the nature of the events that led to 
 an imputation for an efs event at day 0 (in cases where a patients’ preference for another treatment 
 than the assigned standard of care) and the imbalances in these events between treatment groups (n 
 = 10 in soct and n = 2 in axicabtagene ciloleucel) this is considered problematic. it seems to be partly</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 86/129</p><p>
 based on patients’ preferences in this open label study and results in bias in favor of axicabtagene ciloleucel. this apparently makes the derived treatment estimates for efs anti-conservative. despite the 
 definition in the sap this is hence not endorsed. it is acknowledged, however, that these intercurrent 
 events do not impact the derivation and interpretation of os, and should not impact efs to an extend 
 which would render the benefit questionable. 
 importantly, there is no difference in the efs results for the different molecular subtypes, and 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment provided a benefit for both gcb-like and abc-like disease: generally, 
 abc dlbcl is associated with substantially worse outcomes when treated with standard 
 chemoimmunotherapy. additionally, axicabtagene ciloleucel proved to be superior to soct for all disease 
 subtypes. 
 while for efs (per central assessment), axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment was superior to soct when 
 assessed by cd19 ihc-positive status, for cd19 ihc-negative subjects (number of subjects: n=13 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel, n=12 soct), the km median efs was longer in the soct arm compared with 
 the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm. nonetheless, for the orr (per central assessment), axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel treatment was superior to soct when assessed by cd19 ihc-positive or ihc-negative status. 
 the orr for cd19 ihc-positive subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct arms was 83% and 
 52%, respectively, and for cd19 ihc-negative subjects was 85% and 67%, respectively. however, the 
 complete response data does not show a superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment: 38% 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. 42% soct. it seems that the cd19 negative patients were more likely to 
 have partial response as an outcome when compared to soct: 46% vs. 25%.</p><p>
 while similar orr findings, when comparing the outcomes of cd19 positive vs. negative patients, cd19 
 positive patients benefitted more from axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment, than the cd19 negative 
 subjects: complete response: 67% for cd19 positives vs. 38% for cd19 negatives; partial response: 
 16% cd19 positives, 46% cd19 negatives. 
 while there are a number of cd19 negative patients who benefitted from axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, 
 a clear-cut and definite superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. soct cannot be established, moreover, 
 outcome data are more favourable in cd19 positive patients when compared to cd19 negative subjects. 
 the data are less reliable due to the lower patient numbers, yet these tendencies are clearly observable. 
 more data are required to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy in cd19 negative patients. 
 since there is no definite data to prove a benefit of axicabtagene ciloleucel over soct in cd19- negative 
 patients, this aspect needs to be included in the smpc.</p><p>
 a total of 65 patients (36%) received bridging therapy. in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, the orr was 
 the same for the 65 subjects who received bridging therapy (83%) and the 115 subjects who did not 
 receive bridging therapy (83%) the cr rate was also similar: 66% for subjects who received bridging 
 therapy and 64% for subjects who did not receive bridging therapy. it can be concluded, that bridging 
 therapy did not influence the outcomes measured.</p><p> 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in orr with orr rates 
 of 83% in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 50% in the soct arm. given that objective response is 
 a prerequisite to reach hdt-auto-sct, the orr translates into at least 50% of subjects in the soct arm 
 not being able to reach definitive therapy. the cr rate was 2-fold higher in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 arm (65%) compared with the soct arm (32%).</p><p> ema/804955/2022</p><p>page 87/129</p><p>
 the zuma-7 interim os results (cutoff date 18 mar 2021) suggested a trend favouring axicabtagene ciloleucel (median os had not been reached) over soct (median os of 25.7 months). while the data 
 are still immature, the interim analysis of os favoured axicabtagene ciloleucel over soct.</p><p>
 the km median pfs time was longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm.</p><p>although not included in this 
 ar, the pfs subgroup analysis revealed that patients with diagnosis labelled as “other”, as well as asians 
 and african americans had no benefit beyond standard of care. the importance of this result is blurred 
 by the relatively low number of patients in these subgroups.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.3">2.5.3.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>zuma-7 demonstrated superior efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a second-line therapy in adult subjects with r/r lbcl compared to soct. the chosen soct arm is in line with the current esmo gl 
 and, as such, acceptable. of note, the recruited patient population may not be fully representative of 
 the population encountered in clinical practice (e.g. proportion of abc-like disease type). issues in the 
 conduct of study result in uncertainties regarding the derived effects: measures such as a firewall to fully 
 blind the study team in charge with the conduct of study where not in place and hence decisions to alter 
 the study might have been made in the light of the accrued data. modifications to the analysis plan for 
 os render the type 1 error control for os questionable. as the study was not powered for os, only a 
 numerical (rather than statistically significant) benefit might be derived for os anyhow. given the results 
 for efs, orr and cr, this is considered acceptable.</p></section><section><header n="2.6">2.6.  
 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>the safety data analysis set (sas) is based on the main study kte-c19-107 (zuma 7), which is an ongoing (fu ongoing, not recruiting) phase 3 randomized open label clinical trial in adult subjects with 
 relapsed/refractory dlbcl, evaluating axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with soct (salvage 
 chemotherapy followed by hdt-auto-sct) as second line treatment. the primary analysis was performed 
 when 250 event-free survival (efs) events had been observed by central assessment and all subjects 
 had passed the month 9 time point. data are provided as of dco 18 mar 2021 for 170 subjects who 
 received axicabtagene ciloleucel and 168 subjects who received at least 1 dose of salvage chemotherapy 
 in the soct arm (safety analysis set). 
 at the date of data cutoff (18 march 2021), the zuma-7 study had ended for 66 subjects (37%) who 
 had received axicabtagene ciloleucel and for 86 subjects (48%) who had received ≥ 1 dose of standard 
 of care salvage chemotherapy. the primary reason for ending the study for subjects who received 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel was death for 64 subjects (36%) and lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%). the 
 primary reason for ending the study for subjects who received soct was death for 75 subjects (42%), 
 withdrawal of consent for 7 subjects (4%), lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%), investigator decision 
 for 1 subject (1%), and other reason for 1 subject (1%). at dco, the median actual follow-up times of 
 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct arms were 19.6 months and 18.0 months, respectively; 
 the median potential follow-up times were 24.1 months and 24.9 months, respectively, and the minimum 
 potential follow-up times were 16.0 months and 17.2 months, respectively.

 zuma-1(supportive data) in general the safety assessments performed were the same, although the timing of some assessments differed. thus, the difference in safety follow-up between zuma-1 and zuma-7 is the duration of the 
 collection period for aes and saes. in zuma-1, aes were to be collected from commencement of</p><p> ema/804955/2022 
 page 96/129 
 leukapheresis, and saes were to be collected from the time of informed consent. ae and sae collection were to continue until month 3 after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. from month 3 to either month 
 24 or pd (whichever occurred first), only serious targeted aes were to be reported. to investigate the 
 potential impact of the differences in the duration of safety follow-up for subjects who received 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel in zuma-7 and zuma-1, ad-hoc analyses of the overall subject incidences of 
 teaes and targeted saes according to the teae or sae start date were conducted as follows: 
 - teae start date: ≤ 3 months (≤ 92 days) or &gt; 3 months (&gt; 92 days) after the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 infusion or the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. 
 - sae start date: ≤ 24 months (≤ 731 days) and &gt; 24 months (&gt; 731 days) after the axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel infusion or the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy.

 axicabtagene ciloleucel arm with a serious worst grade 3 or higher neurologic event and 1 subject (1%) 
 in the soct arm with a serious worst grade 2 neurologic event. the 3 most common serious treatment-
 emergent neurologic events of any grade in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm were encephalopathy (17 
 subjects, 10%), aphasia (9 subjects, 5%), and confusional state (6 subjects, 4%), and the only serious 
 neurologic event in the soct arm was encephalopathy. 
 treatment-related neurologic events were reported for 92 subjects (54%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 arm and 24 subjects (14%) in the soct arm, including 35 subjects (21%) and 1 subject (1%), 
 respectively, with grade 3 or higher neurologic events. the most frequently reported (in ≥ 10% of

 tremor (37 subjects, 22%), confusional state (35 subjects, 21%), aphasia (35 subjects, 21%), 
 encephalopathy (29 subject, 17%), and somnolence (18 subjects, 11%).</p><p>
 no treatment-related neurologic events occurred with a subject incidence higher than 10% in the soct 
 arm: the most frequently reported treatment-related neurologic events in the soct arm were 
 paresthesia (9 subjects, 5%), agitation, lethargy, cognitive disorder, depressed level of consciousness, 
 delirium, and taste disorder (2 subjects each, 1%). 
 serious treatment-related neurologic events were reported for 32 subjects (19%) in the axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel arm, including 25 subjects (15%) with grade 3 or higher serious neurologic events. no subject 
 in the soct arm had a serious treatment related neurologic event. the most frequently reported (in ≥ 
 2% of subjects) serious treatment-related neurologic events of any grade in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 arm were encephalopathy (17 subjects, 10%), aphasia (9 subjects, 5%), and confusional state, 
 somnolence, and tremor (5 subjects each, 3%). 
 among subjects who had a treatment-emergent neurologic event, the median time to onset was 7.0 
 days (range: 1 to 133 days) after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and 23.0 days (range: 1 to 108 
 days) after the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. 
 at the data cutoff date, neurologic events had resolved in 96 of the 102 subjects in the axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel arm and in 32 of the 33 subjects in the soct arm. a total of 6 subjects in the axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel arm and 1 subject in the soct arm had ongoing neurologic events at the data cutoff date or 
 unresolved neurologic events at the time of death (source listing 16.3.4.1.2 and listing 16.3.7). among 
 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, 1 subject had ongoing neurologic events as of the data cutoff 
 date and 5 subjects had neurologic events that were unresolved at the time of death, as follows: 
 -</p><p>one subject had grade 2 non-serious paresthesia of the lower limbs that started on therapy day 
 16 and grade 1 non-serious memory impairment that started on therapy day 17; both events 
 were ongoing at the data cutoff date. the event of paresthesia was deemed unrelated to 
 leukapheresis or study treatments and memory impairment was deemed related to axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel.</p><p> ema/804955/2022

 depressed level of consciousness and grade 3 non-serious somnolence that both started on 
 therapy day 45. these events were unresolved at the time of death due to pd on therapy day 
 46. the events were deemed unrelated to leukapheresis or study treatments.</p><p>
 -</p><p>one subject had grade 1 non-serious hypoesthesia, which started on therapy day 77 and was-
 unresolved at the time of death due to pd on therapy day 326. the event was deemed-unrelated 
 to leukapheresis or study treatments. 
 -</p><p>one subject had grade 2 non-serious tremor, which started on therapy day 4, changed to a 
 grade 3 serious event on therapy day 13, and changed to a grade 2 non-serious event on 
 therapy day 24 (listing 16.3.2.1) and was unresolved at the time of death due to pd on therapy 
 day 206. the event was deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
 one subject in the soct arm had an ongoing neurologic event of grade 1 non-serious paresthesia, which 
 started on therapy day 20 and was ongoing at the data cutoff date. the event was deemed related to

 a post-marketing risk mitigation program includes administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel at qualified 
 sites that have demonstrated availability of tocilizumab for use in managing crs and neurologic events 
 and educational materials for healthcare providers and patients. a long-term post-marketing study will 
 follow patients who have received yescarta for 15 years and will assess the long-term safety, assess 
 the risk of new malignancy, further characterize important risks, and identify new signals. 
 post-marketing data are provided from the most recently available periodic safety update report/periodic 
 benefit-risk evaluation report for axicabtagene ciloleucel (source m5.3.6). as of 17 april 2021, 808 
 subjects have been exposed to axicabtagene ciloleucel in company-sponsored interventional clinical 
 studies. it is estimated that 4,497 patients have been exposed to axicabtagene ciloleucel in post-
 authorization use. no new identified or potential risks for axicabtagene ciloleucel have emerged following 
 the commercialization of this product and the overall benefit-risk evaluation for axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 continues to be positive.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.1">2.6.1.  
 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the applicant provided a comprehensive safety data package for dco 18 march 2021. the number of patients treated in zuma-7 was n=170 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and n=168 in the soct arm. 
 the median actual follow-up times of subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct arms were 19.6</p><p> ema/804955/2022 
 page 113/129 
 months and 18.0 months, respectively. at the date of data cutoff (18 march 2021), the zuma-7 study has ended for 37% of subjects who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel, and 48% who had received ≥ 
 1 dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. the primary reason for ending the study for subjects 
 who received axicabtagene ciloleucel was death for 64 subjects (36%) and lost to follow-up for 2 subjects 
 (1%). the primary reason for ending the study for subjects who received soct was death for 75 subjects 
 (42%), withdrawal of consent for 7 subjects (4%), lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%), investigator 
 decision for 1 subject (1%), and other reasons for 1 subject (1%).</p><p>
 generally, there are no differences observed in number and grading of teaes in zuma-7 related to the 
 procedures in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm (leukapheresis, lymphodepletion and treatment), when 
 comparing with the other clinical trials in the axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment program. teaes in both 
 treatment arms have been treated according to general toxicity management recommendations, were 
 generally manageable and resolved as of dco; no new safety signals have been reported in either 
 treatment arm. regards teaes observed in the soc arm, which mainly are pancytopenia, 
 hypophosphatemia and febrile neutropenia, these can be considered specific side effect of agents in the 
 permitted regimens for salvage soct, and there is no indication that number and/or grading of occurred 
 teaes differ from them in the zuma-7 soct arm.</p><p>all subjects treated (100%) in both arms had ≥ 1 
 teae. the number of grade 3 or higher teaes assessed related to the axicabtagene ciloleucel was n= 
 112 subjects (66%) versus n=131 (78%) in the soct arm. in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, 85 
 subjects (50%) had an sae, and 72 subjects (42%) had a 3 or higher sae. in the soct arm, 77 subjects 
 (46%) had an sae, and 67 subjects (40%) had a grade 3 or higher sae. the number of saes assessed 
 related to axicabtagene ciloleucel and soct, respectively, was n= 63 subjects (37%) versus n=59 
 subjects (35%).</p><p>fatal teaes were reported for 7 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 2 
 subjects in the soct arm. at the data cutoff date, 142 of 338 subjects (42%) in the safety analysis set 
 had died, including 64 subjects (36%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 75 subjects (42%) in the 
 soct arm.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.2">2.6.2.  
 conclusions on clinical safety</header><p>according to the provided data, no new major safety concerns arise from the new population as no additional safety issues in treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel other than the known have been 
 identified. overall, the teaes and risks are similar to what has been described for other car t cell 
 therapies and for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications, and are manageable with the current 
 risk minimization measures presented in the smpc.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.3">2.6.3.

 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>the current standard of care for the first-line treatment of dlbcl is r chop, which results in 5 year and 10-year efs rates of 47% and 35%, respectively, and 5-year and 10 year os rates of 58% and 44%, 
 respectively in patients 60 to 80 years of age. for patients 18 to 60 years of age treated with r-chop, 
 3-year efs and os rates are 79% and 93%, respectively. the optimal therapy for the first-line treatment 
 of patients with hgbl has not been established, and there is no consensus whether regimens more 
 intensive than r-chop are required; 4 year os rates of 54.5% and 49.6% have been reported for r-
 epoch and r-chop, respectively.</p><p>
 standard second-line therapy in the curative setting for lbcl is comprised of rituximab and platinum-
 containing salvage chemoimmunotherapy followed by hdt and auto-sct for those who are eligible. the 
 efficacy of this regimen has not been fully assessed for hgbl. while hdt auto sct has curative potential, 
 only half of patients respond to second-line salvage chemotherapy and are able to proceed to auto sct, 
 and poor outcomes are observed for patients who cannot undergo auto-sct. besides chemoresistant 
 disease, other reasons for patients not being eligible to receive second line therapy include failure to 
 mobilize cd34+ stem cells for auto sct, poor performance status, organ dysfunction, comorbidities, 
 unresolved treatment emergent toxicities, or older age. for patients who receive second-line therapy, 
 outcomes are particularly poor for those with primary refractory disease or early relapse after first-line 
 therapies and for patients with higher saaipi scores. 
 more recently, 2 therapies (polatuzumab vedotin and tafasitamab) were approved for transplant 
 ineligible patients with r/r dlbcl, and although these new treatment options offer incremental 
 improvements in response rates, duration of responses remain suboptimal and neither therapy has 
 demonstrated curative outcome. thus, a need remains for alternative second line therapies with curative 
 intent, including those with a mechanism of action independent of chemotherapy sensitivity.</p><p> ema/804955/2022

 favourable effects</header><p>efs (stratified hr 0.398, 95%ci 0.308, 0.514), orr and cr data are considered favourable and indicate a superior efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a second-line therapy in adult subjects with r/r lbcl 
 compared with soct. 
 the risk of an efs event for subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm was significantly reduced 
 compared with the soct arm. median efs time was 6.3 months longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 arm compared with the soct arm. the km estimated event-free rate was higher for axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel relative to soct. treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in a significant improvement 
 in orr compared with soct. the cr rate was 2-fold higher (65% vs 32%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 arm compared with the soct arm.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>issues in the conduct of study result in uncertainties regarding the derived effects: measures such as a firewall to fully blind the study team in charge with the conduct of study where not appropriately pre-
 specified and hence decisions to alter the study might have been potentially made in the light of the 
 accrued data. modifications to the (interim) analysis plan for os (multiple changes to the timing and 
 number of interim analyses, changes and contradictions in the approach to control for multiplicity) add 
 uncertainty and potentially render the type 1 error control for os questionable. 
 efs estimates might be biased in favour of axicabtagene ciloleucel. it is acknowledged, however, that 
 this does not impact the derivation and interpretation of os, and should not impact efs to an extend 
 which would render the benefit questionable. an additional limitation is the immaturity of the os data. 
 while there are a number of cd19 negative patients who benefitted from axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, a clear-cut and definite superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. soct 
 cannot be established in cd19 patients, moreover, outcome data in cd19- patients are inferior to the 
 outcomes found in cd19 positive patients. the data are less reliable due to the lower patient numbers, 
 yet these tendencies are clearly observable.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.

 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>generally, the spectrum of the unfavourable effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a car t cell product is known, and currently no major additional issues seem to arise. the disadvantage and limitation,

 of 18 march 2021: median follow-up of 19.6 months for subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel),

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>the strength of the findings is given by the fact that the proposed new indication is based on a trial first of its kind in the field of car-t cells: a randomized trial comparing axicabtagene ciloleucel versus soct 
 in adult subjects with r/r lbcl. the proposed indication is supported by the data obtained in the zuma-
 7 study: zuma-7 demonstrated superior efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a second-line therapy in 
 adult subjects with r/r lbcl compared with soct. the observed superiority based on efs, orr, cr rates 
 indicate that clinically meaningful benefit could be achieved in a second line therapy setting in the 
 intended population of patients with r/r lbcl. the safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel as second-
 line treatment in the intended target population appears acceptable, no new safety concerns have been 
 identified. overall, the teaes and risks are similar to what has been described for other car t cell 
 therapies and for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications, and are manageable with the current 
 risk minimization measures presented in the smpc. 
 the proposed new indication introduced with this extension includes hgbl. the who classifications from 
 2016/ 2022 indicate hgbl as an independent entity within the lbcls. inclusion of both dlbcl and hgbl 
 subtypes as disease entities are supported by the efficacy data, and mechanism of action based on the 
 expression of cd19. importantly, the sample size of patients enrolled in the zuma-7 trial diagnosed with 
 hgbl (hgbl: 43 pts, 24%; dlbcl: 110 pts, 61%) was considered sufficient to support the inclusion of 
 this indication. 
 the new extension of indication contains a limitation to patients relapsing within 12 months from 
 completion of first-line chemoimmunotherapy. indeed, patients with late relapses eligible for standard 
 of care and higher chance of definitive treatment with hdt-asct have not been enrolled. an 
 extrapolation for later relapsing patients was not supported: while indirect comparisons for efs and os 
 are difficult to interpret, the orr of 88% with salvage chemotherapy (coral data) in later relapsing 
 patients is similar to the orr of 83% with yescarta in early relapsing patients indicating comparable 
 antitumour activity. in order to accommodate the study cohort and the sought indication, the mah 
 modified the indication to contain the 12 months limit, which was endorsed. 
 in the zuma-7 study, hdt + auto-sct were parts of the treatment protocol in the control arm for 
 patients intended to proceed to hdt-auto-sct if there was a response to second-line therapy. even 
 though transplant eligibility was not specifically addressed as criterion for axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 treatment eligibility it is likely that investigators only selected patients for the trial that could also be 
 eligible for the soct arm. thus, patients not eligible for hdt/sct were not part of the trial population. 
 from an efficacy point of view, it is acceptable to extrapolate the result from the trial to the population 
 that was not included. since safety has been established in later line settings that also included more 
 advanced and likely more fragile patients extrapolation of safety is also accepted. furthermore, there 
 are not clearly defined criteria for transplant eligibility that could be used for defining the target 
 population. 
 some cd19 ihc negative patients seem to have benefitted from axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, but a 
 definite superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. soct cannot be established for cd19 ihc negative 
 patients. on the other hand, data indicate that the outcome in cd19-negative patients may be worse 
 compared to cd19-positive patients. however, due to the low patient numbers a substantial uncertainty 
 on the efficacy in cd 19-negative patients remains. these findings would point to sensitivity issues of 
 the ihc detection method, also known in the literature. still, literature data clearly show that quantitative 
 antigen density in lbcl assessed by flow cytometry correlates with outcomes after axicabtagene 
 ciloleucel therapy. it is clear that further measures are required to address cd19 negativity in the future.</p><p> ema/804955/2022

 the current esmo guideline on dlbcl diagnosis (published in ann oncol (2015) 26 (suppl 5): v116-v125.) states that: “a morphological diagnosis of dlbcl should be confirmed in all cases by

 combination of both techniques”. the mah implemented/committed to two measures, which were
