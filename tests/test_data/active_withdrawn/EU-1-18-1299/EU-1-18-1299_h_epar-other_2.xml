 grounds for the comp opinion</header><p>the comp opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 was based on the following grounds: 
 • the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor 
 was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing a response in 
 relapsed/refractory patients; 
 • the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
 lymphoma; 
 • the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.8 in 10,000 persons in the european union, at the time the application was made.</p><p>• although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
 product containing autologous t cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 
 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
 condition. the sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrate that remission was 
 recorded in relapsed and refractory patients. the committee considered that this constitutes a 
 clinically relevant advantage.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.

 condition</header><p>follicular lymphoma (fl) represents the second most common subtype of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl). it is an indolent b-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed germinal center b-cells 
 consisting of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium-sized cleaved follicular center cells) and 
 centroblasts (large non-cleaved follicular center cells), mixed with non-malignant cells such as t-cells, 
 follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages (smith et al., 2013; xerri et al., 2016). the who 
 classification has adopted a grading from 1-3, where grade 3 has been subdivided into grade 3a, in 
 which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are sheets of centroblasts (ott et al., 
 2002). the clinical aggressiveness of fl increases with increasing numbers of centroblasts, and 
 subsequently grades. fl grade 1-3a comprises the most prevalent indolent (low-grade) lymphoma 
 subtype of nhl. fl grade 3b is categorized with other fls but is at an intermediate stage of large cell</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000068456</p><p> 
 page 5/14</p><p>transformation and is typically treated as an aggressive (high-grade) lymphoma (dreyling et al., 2021; swerdlow et al., 2016). 
 the aetiology of fl is still poorly understood. it has been suggested that age, gender, and ethnicity 
 may affect a person’s likelihood of developing fl. the incidence of the disease increases with age; 
 although in principle fl may occur at any age, it is extremely rare in children and adolescents. the 
 median age at diagnosis of fl is around 60-65 years. although onset can be gradual at the time of 
 initial diagnosis, advanced fl is typically incurable, and the response rates are lower with shorter 
 durations of response with successive lines of therapy. 
 fl involves lymph nodes, but also spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and waldeyer ring. 
 involvement of non-haematopoietic extra-nodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal (gi) tract or soft 
 tissue are uncommon but may occur in a setting of widespread nodal disease. fl may occasionally be 
 primary in extra-nodal sites, including skin, gi tract, particularly the duodenum, ocular adnexa, breast, 
 and testis. 
 patients with fl generally present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with waxing and waning 
 symptoms present for years. most patients therefore have widespread disease at diagnosis, including 
 peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. approximately 
 10% of the patients have localized disease at diagnosis and less than 20% present with b symptoms 
 (fever, night sweats and weight loss) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) levels. the 
 bone marrow is involved in 40-70% of the cases (swerdlow et al., 2016; freedman, 2020). as an 
 intrinsic disease characteristic, fl typically evolve over time to an aggressive subtype, in 15% of 
 cases. disease relapse is usually rapid, where remissions become a serious challenge despite multiple 
 interventions. eventually, patients succumb to the refractory, high-grade disease transformation and 
 the complications driven by treatments. 
 the approved therapeutic indication “
 treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (fl) after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy” 
 falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of follicular lymphoma”.</p></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat</header><p>the medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the cat/chmp (see epar).</p></section><section><header>chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature</header><p>patients with advanced stage fl disease may experience b symptoms and suffer from unexplained fatigue/asthenia, local effects of lymphadenopathy such as abdominal pain, chest pain, cough or 
 dyspnoea, or symptoms of bone marrow failure leading to cytopenia. other symptoms depend on the 
 location of the lymphoma (e.g., gi bleeding due to gi lymphomas, superior vena cava syndrome due 
 to vein compression, renal failure due to ureter compression, and rarely spinal cord compression). 
 particularly patients with relapsed disease may have reduced quality of life. 
 although the life expectancy has improved due to recent therapeutic advances, fl patients frequently 
 relapse and become progressively more refractory to subsequent lines of therapy. advanced-stage fl 
 is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy, although patients often have good responses 
 to treatment and might live for several years. the survival outcome worsens significantly as the 
 patients progress through multiple lines of therapy and most patients eventually die of progressive 
 lymphoma and its complications (link et al., 2019). furthermore, histologic transformation to high-</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000068456</p><p> 
 page 6/14</p><p>grade nhls that are clinically more aggressive with a poor outcome is relatively common in patients with fl, occurring at a rate of approximately 2-3% per year (kridel et al., 2016; freedman, 2018). 
 the sponsor has not identified any changes in the severe nature of the condition since the orphan 
 designation in 2015. fl remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating, mainly due to 
 lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to 
 aggressive lymphoma.</p></section><section><header>number of people affected or at risk</header><p>the sponsor performed a review of epidemiological data to calculate the prevalence of fl in europe. published data from national, regional and global population-based cancer registries and other relevant 
 sources including the association of nordic cancer registries (ancr; denmark, sweden, finland, 
 norway, and iceland; 2018 data), cancermpact (europe5: germany, italy, spain, france, and the uk; 
 2021 data), global burden of disease (gbd; eu28; 2019 data), hmrn (yorkshire region in the uk; 
 2007-2016 data), and international agency for research on cancer (iarc; eu28 as defined by who; 
 2020 data) were searched. in addition, a search on pubmed and google scholar for peer-reviewed 
 articles reporting frequency measures for fl during the period 2007-2020 was conducted, but no 
 information on direct prevalence estimates for fl was obtained from the published reports found. 
 the sponsor has provided a prevalence estimate based on a literature search and assumptions 
 regarding 5 year and 10 to 20-year survival. they do not appear to have consulted ecis.</p><p>
 the sponsor noted that the median survival rate of fl ranges between 10-20 years, with a 5-year 
 survival of 80-90% (buske et al., 2012; federico et al., 2009; provencio et al., 2017). in addition, fl 
 has been reported to represent 20% of all nhl cases (casulo 2015a et al., luminari et al., 2019, 
 maurer et al., 2014).

 fl, follicular lymphoma; icd, classification of disease; uk, united kingdom; sorted by period</p><p>the sponsor argued that the epidemiology of fl has not been well characterised. there are only a few peer-reviewed published articles on the epidemiology of fl in europe and there is limited information 
 provided in the epidemiological data sources. most population-based studies and epidemiological data 
 sources estimate haematological malignancies at broader categories (such as hodgkin versus non-
 hodgkin lymphoma). for example, data sources such as ancr, gbd, and iarc registries do not 
 provide direct fl estimates. it has been noted that due to the paucity of epidemiological literature on 
 fl, it is unclear whether the distribution of nhl prevalence by age and sex is similar in fl. 
 based on the review of the epidemiological data sources found and the above-mentioned assumptions, 
 the sponsor concluded that the highest 1-year, 5-year and 10-year prevalence of fl reported in europe 
 was 2.09, 2.02 and 3.63 per 10,000 persons, respectively {ancr 2018, gbd 2019, hmrn 2019, iarc 
 2020}. in view of the most recent prevalence figures accepted for this condition, it appeared that the 
 assumptions regarding the incidence and survival for the prevalence estimate are underestimated.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000068456</p><p> 
 page 8/14</p><p>the sponsor provided a revised prevalence estimate for fl upon request. according to ecis, the 2020 age standardized incidence of nhl in eu27 was 1.83 per 10,000 persons (a). kanas and colleagues 
 established nhl subtype distribution from peer-reviewed literature and showed that the weighted 
 average (weighted by study population size) for the fl proportion across eu was 16.3% (kanas et al., 
 2022a) (b). the incidence of fl was estimated using the formula: incidence of nhl (a) x proportion of 
 nhl presented as fl (b). the estimated incidence of fl based on this was 0.298 per 10,000 persons. 
 the sponsor then indicated that a search of epidemiological data sources was conducted to estimate 
 the overall median duration of the disease, based on reported median overall survival (os), which 
 ranged from 11 years to 16.3 years (mozas et al., 2020; provencio et al., 2017). for this estimation, 
 the sponsor limited the sources to studies published using real-world data only, randomized control 
 trials and usa only specific estimates were excluded. 
 a maximum median os was then used by the sponsor to estimate the complete prevalence for fl 
 (16.3 years). the updated prevalence was calculated using the standard formula prevalence (p) = 
 incidence of fl (i) x median os (d) = 0.298 x 16.3 = 4.85 per 10,000 persons in the eu. the final 
 proposed estimate of 4.85 in 10,000 people was accepted by the comp and rounded off to 4.9 in 
 10,000 people in the european community.</p></section><section><header>article 3(1)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
 those affected by the condition. 
 existing methods</header><p>the sponsor described the treatment methods available to patients with fl based on european and american treatment guidelines (dreyling et al., 2021; nccn 2020). several therapies are authorised 
 both centrally and nationally in the eu for treatment of adult patients with fl, nhl, and lymphomas. 
 these medicines include rituximab (mabthera), yttrium-90 [90y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan 
 (zevalin), idelalisib (zydelig), duvelisib (copiktra), obinutuzumab (gazyvaro), lenalidomide (revlimid), 
 bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, interferon-
 alpha-2a/b, prednisolone, and vincristine. other treatment options also exist, such as radiotherapy and 
 autologous stem cell transplantation (asct) or allogenic sct. 
 patients with newly diagnosed fl are generally treated with an anti-cd20 antibody in monotherapy, 
 rituximab (r) or obinutuzumab (g), or an anti-cd20-containing regimen (e.g., g/r-b, g/r-chop, and 
 g/r-cvp). available treatment options for r/r fl patients depends on the patient’s health, age, stage of 
 disease, comorbidities, tumour burden, and the type and duration of response to prior therapy. the 
 most recent european society for medical oncology (esmo) guidelines for newly diagnosed and 
 relapsed fl describe the current standard of care for these patients (dreyling, ann oncol. 2021; 32(3): 
 298-308). according to the guidelines, therapy should be initiated only upon the development of 
 symptoms. the guidelines identify two types of fl patient populations that are offered two different 
 treatment algorithms depending on their tumour burden.</p><p>the clinical course of fl is characterized by recurrences requiring multiple lines of treatment until 
 eventually patients run out of treatment options and develop fatal disease resistant to any available 
 treatment.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 variation that the product should be intended for fl without any grade-relevant restrictions, since an extrapolation 
 of the positive benefit/risk balance of yescarta observed in the studied fl grade 1-3a and dlbcl populations to 
 patients with fl grade 3b can be considered acceptable. the label of yescarta is thus for all grades of fl.</p></section><section><header>significant benefit</header><p>the sponsor did not seek protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 page 11/14</p><p>the sponsor argued that axi-cel represents a significant benefit based on the improved efficacy observed in the pivotal study zuma-5 for the indication extension compared to therapies approved in 
 the eu for the treatment of adult patients with r/r fl in the fourth- and later lines setting. a post hoc 
 analysis using supportive datasets from scholar-5 was presented to provide further context to the 
 clinical outcomes in zuma-5. 
 the primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of axi-cel in the extension of indication to include 
 treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) fl were obtained from the ongoing, open-
 label, multicentre, single-arm phase 2 study zuma-5. the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy 
 and safety of axi-cel in adults with r/r indolent nhl (inhl), including fl. eligible fl patients (≥18 
 years) had r/r fl grade 1-3a after at least two prior lines of therapy, which must have included an 
 anti-cd20 therapy combined with an alkylating agent. patients with histological grade 3b fl were 
 excluded from the study. axi-cel was administered as a single iv infusion with a target dose of 2x10
 6 anti-cd19 car+ t-cells/kg (1.0-2.4×106 anti-cd19 car+ t-cells/kg). for patients weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2x10
 8 anti-cd19 car+ t-cells was administered. data were reported from an extended 24-month follow-up analysis with a data cut-off (dco) date of 
 31-mar-2021. the primary endpoint of zuma-5 is objective response rate (orr), defined as the 
 proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (cr) and partial response (pr) as assessed 
 by central review per lugano 2014 classification response criteria (cheson, j clin oncol. 2014; 32(27): 
 3059-68). secondary efficacy endpoints included orr and cr per central assessment for patients who 
 had at least three lines of prior therapy, duration of response (dor) and progression-free survival 
 (pfs) both per central and investigator assessments, and os. 
 among the 75 patients with fl who received 3 or more prior lines of therapy in the fas excluding 
 centrally confirmed non-fl, the median age was 60.0 years (range: 34-79) and 31% (23/75) were 65 
 years of age or older. most of the patients were white (93%; 70/75) and males (63%; 47/75). the 
 majority had stage iii or iv disease (87%; 65/75) (at initial diagnosis) and refractory disease (77%; 
 58/75). more than half of the patients (57%; 43/75) had high tumour bulk as defined by gelf criteria. 
 the flipi score was also high in 45% (34/75) of the patients and around half of patients (51%; 38/75) 
 had a history of disease progression within 24 months of initiating their first chemoimmunotherapy 
 (pod24). the patients had a median of 4 prior lines of therapy (range: 3-10), where 33% (25/75) had 
 received 4 prior lines and 27% (20/75) had received 5 or more prior lines of therapy. all patients had 
 received a prior anti-cd20 therapy and an alkylated agent, and 24% (18/75) were considered double 
 refractory (refractory to the first 2 lines of therapy). in addition, 29% (22/75) had previously received 
 an asct, 40% (30/75) had previously received a pi3k inhibitor, and 37% (28/75) had previously been 
 treated with lenalidomide. 
 the baseline data submitted showed that patients recruited included those who were relapsed or 
 refractory to 5 lines or more of therapy where pi3k inhibitors such as zydelig and copiktra, or anti-
 cd20 therapy such as mabthera, gazyvaro and zevalin, or anthracyclins such as pixruvi as well as 
 revlimid (lenalidomide) had been used.</p><p>
 at the dco for the extended 24-month follow-up analysis, the primary endpoint orr was 91% (68/75; 
 95% ci: 82, 96) in fl patients who had received 3 or more prior lines of therapy (fas, leukapheresed 
 patients). the observed benefit of axi-cel in terms of orr was supported by the secondary endpoints. 
 the cr rate was 77% (58/75; 95% ci: 66, 86) in the subset of patients corresponding to the proposed 
 therapeutic indication. the kaplan-meier median estimates for dor was 38.6 months (95% ci: 24.7, 
 not estimable [ne]) and 40.2 months (95% ci: 26.6, ne) for pfs. the median os was not reached at 
 the last dco.</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000068456</p><p> 
 page 13/14</p><p>in study 106-06, treatment with ibritumomab resulted in an orr and cr rate of 74% (95% ci: 60, 85) and 15% (95% ci: 7, 27), respectively. a median dor of 6.4 months and a median time to 
 progression (ttp) of 6.8 months was shown (zevalin smpc; witzig et al., 2007). the fl patients in 
 this study had received a median of 4 (range: 1-9) prior regimens. in study 106-04, the orr and cr 
 rate was significantly higher in patients treated with ibritumomab compared to rituximab with 80% 
 versus 56%, and 30% versus 16%, respectively. of note, all patients in this study were rituximab 
 naïve which would challenge applicability of the efficacy outcomes in the contemporary era where 
 almost all r/r fl patients have received prior treatment with rituximab. the duration of cr and ttp, 
 however, were not significantly different between the two treatment arms, not in the overall patient 
 population, nor in the fl subgroup (gordon et al., 2004). the median pfs was 11.2 and 10.1 months 
 for patients in the ibritumomab and rituximab arms, respectively (zevalin smpc). by contrast, zuma-5 
 demonstrated an orr of 91%, with a cr rate of 77%, and the median pfs was 40.2 months. 
 the sponsor concluded that the efficacy outcomes observed in zuma-5 demonstrated a substantial 
 benefit of axi-cel in r/r fl patients after 
 ≥3 prior lines of therapy, a disease setting which currently lacks any optimal authorised treatments. 
 the data obtained from the pivotal phase 2 study 106-06 is considered the most relevant evidence to 
 contextualize the benefit of yescarta over zevalin. the sponsor did not provide any comparison of 
 baseline characteristics for the study populations from the two pivotal studies zuma-5 and 106-06 but 
 noted that zuma-5 encompassed a more heavily pre-treated patient population, enriched for high-risk 
 features such as pod24 and refractory disease. the reported efficacy outcomes from the two clinical 
 studies indicated that patients with r/r fl treated with axi-cel in zuma-5 achieved a more durable and 
 higher orr and cr rate compared to patients treated with ibritumomab in the pivotal study 106-06. 
 specifically, the cr rate of axi-cel in zuma-5 was &gt;5 times higher than that reported for ibritumomab 
 in study 106-06 (77% vs. 15%). the orr was also higher (91% vs. 74%) and the reported dor more 
 durable for axi-cel than ibritumomab (median 6.4 months for ibritumomab and 38.6 months for axi-cel 
 at the dco for an extended 24-month follow-up analysis) in patients with r/r fl who had received 
 three or more prior lines of therapy. 
 the indirect comparison of efficacy data from the two pivotal single-arm studies zuma-5 and 106-06 
 provide adequate evidence to support the claim for sb of axi-cel based on better efficacy in terms of 
 higher, deeper, and more durable responses compared to ibritumomab in r/r fl patients in the fourth- 
 and later lines setting. 
 the comp agreed to recommend maintaining the orphan designation.</p></section><section><header n="4">4.  
 comp position adopted on 12 may 2022</header><p>the comp concluded that: • the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the designated orphan medicinal product; 
 • the prevalence of follicular lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.9 in 10,000 persons in the 
 european union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
 • the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
 lymphoma;</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p>

 page 14/14</p><p>• although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the european union, the assumption that yescarta may be of potential significant benefit to those 
 affected by the orphan condition still holds. the sponsor has provided clinical study data which 
 demonstrated improved and sustained response rates after treatment with yescarta as compared 
 to zevalin in adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after three or more lines 
 of systemic therapy. 
 the comp, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of article 
 5(12)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
 • the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; • the criteria for designation as set out in article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. the committee for orphan medicinal products has recommended that yescarta, autologous t cells 
 transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor, 
 axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of follicular lymphoma (eu/3/15/1579) is not removed from the 
 community register of orphan medicinal products.</p></section></body></xml>
