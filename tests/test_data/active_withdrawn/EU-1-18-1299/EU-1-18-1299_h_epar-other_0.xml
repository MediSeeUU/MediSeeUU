  1 notifications are issued for type i variations and article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type ii variation or extension application or a worksharing application). opinions are issued for all other procedures. 
 2 a commission decision (cd) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex ii, labelling, package leaflet). the cd is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of article 23.1a(a) of regulation (eu) no. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

 adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular 
 lymphoma (fl) after three or more lines of systemic 
 therapy. consequently, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
 of the smpc and package leaflet are proposed to be 
 updated. as a consequence, the rmp (version 7.0) 
 has been updated to align with the indication 
 extension.

 to make minor editorial corrections throughout the 
 smpc and package leaflet.

 based on the mitt population (results from an independent 
 review committee), the objective response rate and the 
 complete response rate were 74% and 54%, respectively.  
 the median time to response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 
 to 12.2 months). the duration of response was longer in 
 patients who achieved complete response compared to 
 patients with a best response of partial response. of the 55 
 patients who achieved cr, 7 patients had sd and 10 had 
 pr at their initial tumour assessment and converted to cr 
 as late as 12 months after yescarta infusion.  median 
 duration of response and median overall survival have not 
 been reached.
  due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of yescarta, a 
 period of b-cell aplasia is expected following treatment. 
 among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 
 40% had detectable b cells; the b cell aplasia observed in 
 the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior 
 therapies. following yescarta treatment, the proportion 
 of patients with detectable b cells decreased: 20% had 
 detectable b cells at month 3, and 22% had detectable b 
 cells at month 6. the initiation of b cell recovery was first 
 noted at month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable b- 
 cells. this trend of b- cell recovery continued over time, as 
 64% of patients had detectable b- cells at month 18, and 
 77% of patients had detectable b- cells at month 24. it is 
 important to note that patients were not required to be 
 followed after they progressed; thus, the majority of 
 patients with evaluable samples were responders.
