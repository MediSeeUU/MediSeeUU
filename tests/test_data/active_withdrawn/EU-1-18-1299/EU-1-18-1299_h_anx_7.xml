 treated with yescarta. at least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome 
 (crs) and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion. the treatment centre must have 
 access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional 
 case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the european medicines 
 agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab must be 
 available prior to infusion.</p><p>
 posology</p><p>
 yescarta is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 a single dose of yescarta contains 2 x 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (or maximum of 2 x 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 ml dispersion in an infusion bag.</p><p>
 the availability of yescarta must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen.</p><p>
 pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) • a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenous and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenous must be administered prior to infusing yescarta. the recommended days are on the 5
 th, 4th, and 3rd day before infusion of yescarta.</p><p>
 pre-medication • paracetamol 500-1 000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 25 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent) approximately 1 hour before yescarta infusion is recommended. 
 • prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the activity of yescarta.</p><p>
 monitoring • patients must be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities. physicians should consider 
 hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs or symptoms of crs and/or 
 neurologic events. 
 • after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the physician’s discretion. 
 • patients must be instructed to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>

 there is no clinical experience in patients with active hiv, hbv or hcv infection.</p><p>
 paediatric population the safety and efficacy of yescarta 
 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet 
 been established. no data are available.</p><p>
 elderly no dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age. efficacy was consistent with the overall treated patient population.</p><p>
 4 method of administration</p><p>
 yescarta is to be administered via intravenous infusion.</p><p>
 yescarta must not be irradiated. do not use a leukodepleting filter.</p><p>
 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product this medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells. healthcare professionals handling yescarta must take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential 
 transmission of infectious diseases.</p><p>
 preparation for infusion • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>• the yescarta bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.</p><p>
 • once the patient id is confirmed, remove the yescarta bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines for the handling of waste of human-derived material 
 (or immediately contact kite). 
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. yescarta must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new medium prior to infusion. thawing takes 
 approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 °c-25 °c) for up to 3 hours. however, yescarta infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 administration • for autologous use only. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage 
 that is listed in the european medicines agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative 
 measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion. 
 • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • central venous access is recommended for the administration of yescarta. • verify the patient id again to match the patient identifiers on the yescarta bag. • prime the tubing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) prior to infusion. 
 • infuse the entire content of the yescarta bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. • after the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) to ensure all yescarta is delivered.</p><p>

 yescarta is intended solely for autologous use and must not be administered to other patients. before 
 infusion, the patient’s identity must match the patient identifiers on the yescarta infusion bag and 
 cassette. do not infuse yescarta if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the 
 intended patient.</p><p>
 patients must be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of 
 potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities. physicians should consider hospitalisation for 
 the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of crs and/or neurologic events. after 
 the first 10 days following infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within the proximity of a qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks 
 following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs or 
 neurological adverse reactions occur. monitoring of vital signs and organ function must be considered 
 depending on the severity of the reaction.</p><p>
 reasons to delay treatment</p><p>
 due to the risks associated with yescarta treatment, infusion must be delayed if a patient has any of 
 the following conditions: 
 • unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or hypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. 
 • active uncontrolled infection. • active graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).</p><p>
 serological testing</p><p>
 screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing of 
 yescarta (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 blood, organ, tissue and cell donation</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation.</p><p>
 concomitant disease</p><p>
 patients with active cns disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac function are 
 likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require 
 special attention.</p><p>
 primary central nervous system (cns) lymphoma</p><p>
 there is no experience of use of yescarta in patients with primary cns lymphoma. therefore, the 
 risk/benefit of yescarta has not been established in this population.</p><p>
 6 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>
 nearly all patients experienced some degree of crs. severe crs, including life-threatening and fatal 
 reactions, was very commonly observed with yescarta with a time to onset of 1 to 12 days in zuma-
 1 and 1 to 11 days in zuma-5 (see section 4.8). crs should be managed at the physician’s discretion, 
 based on the patient’s clinical presentation and according to the crs management algorithm provided 
 in table 1. interleukin-6 (il-6) receptor inhibitor based therapy such as tocilizumab has been 
 administered for moderate or severe crs associated with yescarta.</p><p>
 at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient must be on site and available for administration prior to 
 yescarta infusion. the treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 
 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a 
 shortage that is listed in the european medicine agency shortage catalogue, the treatment centre must 
 have access to suitable alternative measures instead of tocilizumab to treat crs.</p><p>
 monitor patients daily for signs and symptoms of crs for at least 10 days following infusion at the 
 qualified clinical facility. after the first 10 days following infusion, the patient is to be monitored at 
 the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks 
 following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs occur. 
 treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the crs symptoms experienced by 
 patients on yescarta. these include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids for 
 moderate, severe, or life-threatening crs as summarised in table 1. patients who experience grade 2 
 or higher crs (e.g. hypotension, not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental 
 oxygenation) must be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. for patients 
 experiencing severe crs, consider performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function. for 
 severe or life-threatening- crs, consider intensive-care supportive therapy.</p><p>
 yescarta must not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disease until 
 these conditions have resolved.</p><p>
 crs has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and 
 pulmonary). in addition worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of crs. 
 patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction must be managed by standards of critical care 
 and measures such as echocardiography are to be considered.</p><p>
 diagnosis of crs requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including 
 infection. in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum 
 antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 evaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (hlh/mas) 
 is to be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive crs.</p><p>
 yescarta continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. 
 tumour necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
 yescarta-associated crs.</p><p>

 severe neurologic adverse reactions, also known as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
 syndrome (icans) have been very commonly observed in patients treated with yescarta, which could 
 be life-threatening or fatal (see section 4.8). patients with a history of cns disorders such as seizures 
 or cerebrovascular ischaemia may be at increased risk. fatal and serious cases of cerebral oedema 
 have been reported in patients treated with yescarta. patients must be monitored for signs and 
 symptoms of neurologic adverse reactions (table 2). patients must be monitored at least daily for 10 
 days at the qualified healthcare facility following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic 
 toxicity/icans. after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the 
 physician’s discretion. counsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at 
 least 4 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of 
 8 neurologic toxicity/icans occur. monitoring of vital signs and organ functions must be considered depending on the severity of the reaction.</p><p>
 patients who experience grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities /icans must be monitored with 
 continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. provide intensive-care supportive therapy for severe 
 or life-threatening neurologic toxicities. non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines are to be considered for 
 seizure prophylaxis as clinically indicated for grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. treatment 
 algorithms have been developed to ameliorate the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by 
 patients on yescarta. these include the use of tocilizumab (if concurrent crs) and/or corticosteroids 
 for moderate, severe, or life-threatening neurologic adverse reactions as summarised in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2: neurologic adverse reaction/icans grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>grading assessment

 serious infections have been very commonly observed with yescarta (see section 4.8). patients must 
 be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before, during, and after yescarta infusion and 
 treated appropriately. prophylactic anti-microbials should be administered according to standard 
 institutional guidelines.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after yescarta infusion (see section 4.8) and may be 
 concurrent with crs. in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with 
 broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 9 hbv reactivation</p><p>
 hbv reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur 
 in patients treated with drugs directed against b-cells. screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv must be 
 performed before collection of cells for manufacturing of yescarta.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias</p><p>
 patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
 yescarta infusion. grade 3 or higher prolonged cytopenias following yescarta infusion occurred very 
 commonly and included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. monitor blood counts after 
 yescarta infusion.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia</p><p>
 b-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with 
 yescarta. hypogammaglobulinaemia has been very commonly observed in patients treated with 
 yescarta. immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with yescarta and managed 
 using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement.</p><p>
 hypersensitivity reactions</p><p>
 allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of yescarta. serious hypersensitivity reactions 
 including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) or residual gentamicin in yescarta.</p><p>
 secondary malignancies</p><p>
 patients treated with yescarta may develop secondary malignancies. monitor patients life-long for 
 secondary malignancies. in the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact the company to 
 obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.</p><p>
 tumour lysis syndrome (tls)</p><p>
 tls, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. to minimise risk of tls, patients with 
 elevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, 
 prior to yescarta infusion. signs and symptoms of tls must be monitored and events managed 
 according to standard guidelines.</p><p>
 prior treatment with anti-cd19 therapy</p><p>
 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients exposed to prior cd19-directed therapy. 
 yescarta is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with cd19-negative disease after prior 
 anti-cd19 therapy.</p><p>
 excipients</p><p>
 this medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion bag, equivalent to 15% of the who 
 recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.</p><p>
 patients are expected to enrol in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better 
 understand the long-term safety and efficacy of yescarta.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no interaction studies have been performed with yescarta.</p><p>
 10 live vaccines</p><p>
 the safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following yescarta treatment has not 
 been studied. vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the 
 start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery 
 following treatment with yescarta.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception</p><p>
 the pregnancy status of women of child bearing potential must be verified before starting yescarta 
 treatment.</p><p>
 see the prescribing information for lymphodepleting chemotherapy for information on the need for 
 effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p>
 there are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of 
 contraception following treatment with yescarta.</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no available data with yescarta use in pregnant women. no reproductive and developmental 
 toxicity animal studies have been conducted with yescarta to assess whether it can cause foetal harm 
 when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 it is not known if yescarta has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. based on the mechanism of 
 action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including b-cell 
 lymphocytopenia. therefore, yescarta is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for 
 women of childbearing potential not using contraception. pregnant women must be advised on the 
 potential risks to the foetus. pregnancy after yescarta therapy must be discussed with the treating 
 physician.</p><p>
 assessment of immunoglobulin levels and b-cells in newborns of mothers treated with yescarta must 
 be considered.</p><p>breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is unknown whether yescarta is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. 
 breast-feeding women must be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.</p><p>

 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>crs occurred in 93% of patients in zuma-1 and 77% of patients in zuma-5. eleven percent (11%) of patients in zuma-1 and 6% of patients in zuma-5 experienced grade 3 or higher (severe, life-
 threatening, and fatal) crs. the median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1 to 12 days) for patients in 
 zuma-1 and 4 days (range: 1 to 11 days) for patients in zuma-5, and the median duration was 
 7.5 days (range: 2 to 29 days, with the exception of one outlying observation of 58 days) for patients 
 in zuma-1 and 6 days (range: 1 to 27 days) for patients in zuma-5. ninety-eight percent (98%) of 
 patients in zuma-1 and 99% of patients in zuma-5 recovered from crs.</p><p>
 the most common signs or symptoms associated with crs included pyrexia (90%), hypotension 
 (42%), hypoxia (23%), chills (23%), tachycardia (17%) and sinus tachycardia (17%). serious adverse 
 reactions that may be associated with crs included pyrexia (5%), hypoxia (3%), hypotension (1%), 
 acute kidney injury (1%), atrial fibrillation (1%), atrial flutter (1%) and ejection fraction decrease 
 (1%). see section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 neurologic adverse reactions neurologic adverse reactions occurred in 66% of patients in zuma-1 and 57% of patients in zuma-5. thirty-one percent (31%) of patients in zuma-1 and 16% of patients in zuma-5 experienced 
 grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) adverse reactions. neurologic toxicities occurred within 
 the first 7 days of infusion for 93% of patients in zuma-1 and 65% of patients in zuma-5. the 
 median time to onset was 5 days (range: 1 to 17 days) for patients in zuma-1 and 7 days (range: 1 to 
 177 days) for patients in zuma-5. the median duration was 13 days in zuma-1 and 14 days in 
 zuma-5, with resolution occurring within 3 weeks for 61% and 60% of patients respectively, 
 following infusion.</p><p>
 the most common signs or symptoms associated with neurologic adverse reactions included tremors 
 (30%), encephalopathy (28%), confusional state (25%), aphasia (15%), and somnolence (12%). 
 serious neurologic adverse reactions reported in patients who were administered yescarta included 
 encephalopathy (12%), confusional state (5%), aphasia (3%), agitation (2%), somnolence (2%) and 
 delirium (1%).</p><p>
 15 other neurologic adverse reactions have been reported less frequently in clinical trials and included dysphagia (5%), myelitis (0.2%), and quadriplegia (0.2%).</p><p>
 adverse reactions reported in the post-marketing setting include status epilepticus (0.4%), spinal cord 
 oedema and icans which were reported in the context of neurologic toxicity.</p><p>
 see section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia and infections</p><p>febrile neutropenia was observed in 16% of patients after yescarta infusion. infections occurred in 50% of patients. grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) infections occurred in 22% of 
 patients. grade 3 or higher unspecified pathogen, bacterial, and viral infections occurred in 15%, 7%, 
 and 5% of patients respectively. the most common site of infection was in the respiratory tract. see 
 section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias</p><p>grade 3 or higher neutropenia , anaemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 60%, 32%, and 29% of patients, respectively. prolonged (still present at day 30 or with an onset at day 30 or beyond) 
 grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia occurred in 26%, 16%, and 8% of 
 patients, respectively. in zuma-1, grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia 
 present after day 93 occurred in 11%, 7%, and 3% of patients, respectively. see section 4.4 for 
 management guidance.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 16% of patients treated with yescarta. cumulatively, 36 (33%) of 108 subjects in zuma-1 received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy at the time of the 
 54-month analysis, and 32 (27%) of 119 subjects in zuma-5 received intravenous immunoglobulin 
 therapy at the time of the 24-month follow-up analysis. see section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>
 immunogenicity</p><p>
 the immunogenicity of yescarta has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
 (elisa) for the detection of binding antibodies against fmc63, the originating antibody of the 
 anti-cd19 car. three out of 106 patients in zuma-1 preliminary tested positive via an elisa 
 screen for anti-fmc63 antibodies prior to being treated with yescarta. in zuma-5, 13 out of 116 
 patients preliminary tested positive for antibodies in the elisa screen prior to being treated with 
 yescarta, and 2 subjects who had negative results prior to treatment had positive test results after 
 treatment. results of a confirmatory cell-based assay demonstrated that all patients treated with 
 yescarta and had an elisa positive result were antibody negative by the confirmatory assay, before, 
 during and after treatment. an impact of these antibodies on efficacy or safety was not discernible.</p><p>
 special population</p><p>
 there is limited experience with yescarta in patients ≥ 75 years of age. generally, safety and efficacy 
 were similar between patients ≥ 65 years and patients &lt; 65 years of age treated with yescarta. 
 outcomes were consistent between patients with eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) of 0 
 and 1 and by sex.</p><p>
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions</p><p>
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in appendix v.</p><p>

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 yescarta, an engineered autologous t-cell immunotherapy product, binds to cd19 expressing cancer 
 cells and normal b-cells. following anti-cd19 car t-cell engagement with cd19 expressing target 
 cells, the cd28 and cd3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signalling cascades that 
 lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions, and secretion of inflammatory 
 cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of cd19-
 expressing target cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in phase 2 of zuma-1 and zuma-5, after yescarta infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were 
 evaluated over a 4-week interval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other 
 molecules in blood. levels of cytokines and chemokines such as il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, tnf-α, 
 ifn-γ, and il2rα were analyzed. peak elevation was observed within the first 14 days after infusion, 
 and levels generally returned to baseline within 28 days.</p><p>
 due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of yescarta, a period of b-cell aplasia is expected following 
 treatment. among 73 dlbcl and pmbcl patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had 
 detectable b-cells; the b-cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to 
 prior therapies. following yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells 
 decreased: 20% had detectable b-cells at month 3, and 22% had detectable b-cells at month 6. the 
 initiation of b-cell recovery was first noted at month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable b-cells. 
 this trend of b-cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 
 18, and 77% of patients had detectable b-cells at month 24. patients were not required to be followed 
 after they progressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders. among 
 113 fl patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 75% of patients had detectable b-cells. following 
 yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable b-cells decreased: 40% of patients had 
 detectable b-cells at month 3. b-cell recovery was observed over time, with 61% of patients had 
 detectable b-cells at month 24.</p><p>
 analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of crs or 
 neurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of inflammatory serum 
 analytes including il-6, were correlated with grade 3 or higher neurologic events and grade 3 or 
 higher crs. higher levels of multiple serum analytes including il-15 were associated with grade 3 or 
 higher neurologic events and grade 3 or higher crs in zuma-1 and were associated with grade 3 or 
 higher crs in zuma-5.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 dlbcl, pmbcl and dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma (zuma-1) a total of 108 patients were treated with yescarta in a phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive b-cell nhl. efficacy was based on 
 101 patients in phase 2, including histologically confirmed dlbcl (n = 77), pmbcl (n = 8), or 
 dlbcl arising from follicular lymphoma, (n = 16) based on the 2008 who-classification. dlbcl 
 in zuma-1 included patients with dlbcl nos, other dlbcl subtypes, and high-grade b-cell 
 17 lymphoma (hgbcl) based on the 2016 who-classification. forty-seven patients were evaluable for myc, bcl-2, and bcl-6 status. thirty were found to have double expressor dlbcl (overexpression 
 of both myc and bcl-2 protein); 5 were found to have hgbcl with myc, bcl-2 or bcl-6 gene 
 rearrangement (double- and triple-hit); and 2 were found to have hgbcl not otherwise specified. 
 sixty-six patients were evaluable for cell-of-origin classifications (germinal center b-cell type [gcb] 
 or activated b-cell type [abc]). of these, 49 patients had gcb-type and 17 patients had abc-type.</p><p>
 eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with refractory disease defined as progressive disease (pd) or 
 stable disease (sd) as best response to last line of therapy, or disease progression within 12 months 
 after autologous stem cell transplant (asct). patients who were refractory to chemotherapy or who 
 relapsed after two or more lines of systemic therapy were generally ineligible for haematopoietic stem 
 cell transplantation. patients must have received at least prior anti-cd20 antibody therapy and an 
 anthracycline containing regimen. patients with cns lymphoma, a history of allogeneic stem cell 
 transplantation (sct) or prior anti-cd19 car or other genetically modified t-cell therapy were 
 excluded. patients with a history of cns disorders (such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischemia), 
 cardiac ejection fraction of less than 50% or room air oxygen saturation of less than 92%, or 
 autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression were ineligible. the median duration of 
 follow-up was 63.1 months (still ongoing). a summary of the patient demographics is provided in

 of 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 101 received yescarta. nine patients were not treated, 
 primarily due to progressive disease or serious adverse events after enrolment and prior to cell 
 delivery. one out of 111 patients did not receive the product due to manufacturing failure. the median 
 time from leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days (range: 14 to 51 days), and the median time 
 from leukapheresis to infusion was 24 days (range: 16 to 73 days). the median dose was 2.0 x 10

 (p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>
 in the primary analysis, based on the mitt population (minimum follow-up of 6 months) the orr 
 was 72% and the complete response (cr) rate was 51%, as determined by an independent review 
 committee. in the 12 month followup analysis (table 5), the orr was 72% and the cr rate was 51%. 
 the median time to response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 6.3 months). the dor was longer in 
 patients who achieved cr, as compared to patients with a best response of partial response (pr). of 
 the 52 patients who achieved cr, 7 patients had sd and 9 had pr at their initial tumour assessment 
 and converted to cr as late as 6.5 months. the orr results within pmbcl and dlbcl arising from 
 follicular lymphoma were both 88%. cr rates were 75% and 56%, respectively. of the 111 patients in 
 the itt population, the orr was 66% and the cr was 47%. other outcomes were consistent with 
 those of the mitt population.</p><p>
 in the 24-month follow-up analysis, based on the mitt population (results from an independent 
 review committee), the orr and the cr rate were 74% and 54%, respectively. the median time to

 2 intravenously and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenously, both given on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before yescarta. all patients were hospitalized for observation for a minimum of 7 days after yescarta 
 infusion. the administration and monitoring of yescarta is consistent between zuma-5 and zuma-

 the primary analysis was performed, when at least 80 consecutively enrolled fl patients had a 
 minimum follow-up of 12 months from first response assessment. the primary endpoint was orr. 
 secondary endpoints included cr rate, orr and cr in subjects who received 3 or more lines of prior 
 therapy, dor, os and progression free survival (pfs) and incidence of adverse events. three out of 
 the 122 fl patients enrolled at the time of the primary analysis were not treated, primarily due to 
 ineligibility, experiencing cr prior or death prior to the treatment. 
 a 24-month follow-up analysis was performed, when at least 80 fl patients had a minimum follow-up 
 of 24 months after infusion.</p><p>
 as of the 24-month follow-up analysis, no additional patients underwent leukapheresis nor were 
 treated with yescarta. no manufacturing failures occurred. the median time from leukapheresis to 
 product release was 12 days (range: 10 to 37 days), leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days 
 (range: 13 to 72 days) and leukapheresis to yescarta infusion was 27 days (range: 19 to 330 days). the

 the 24-month follow-up analysis was performed on the 122 enrolled fl patients, and 119 of these 
 patients were treated with yescarta. among the 122 enrolled fl patients, 75 had 3 or more lines of 
 prior therapy, resulting in an orr of 91% and cr rate of 77%. the median time to response was 1 
 month (range: 0.8 to 3.1 months), the median dor was 38.6 months and the proportion of responders 
 who remained in response was 56% at month 24. twenty nine out of 75 fl patients who had 3 or 
 more prior lines of therapy initially achieved a pr, 19 of whom later achieved cr. subgroup analysis 
 included orr in patients who were refractory (88%), flipi score ≥3 (94%), high tumour burden 
 (91%), progression of disease within 24 months of first immunotherapy (89%) and prior treatment 
 with pi3k inhibitor (90%). key efficacy results for fl patients with 3 or more prior lines of therapy

 (fl) affecting your lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell 
 called b lymphocytes and other organs in your body. too many of these abnormal white blood cells 
 accumulate in your tissue and this is the cause of the symptoms you may have. it is used to treat these 
 conditions when other available medicines have stopped working for you.</p><p>
 the medicine is made specially for you as a single administration of your own modified white blood 
 cells. it is given by a drip (
 infusion) into a vein (intravenously).</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you are given yescarta

 -</p><p>have kidney problems. 
 -</p><p>have low blood cell levels (blood counts). 
 37 - have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. 
 -</p><p>have any lung, heart or blood pressure (low or raised) problems. 
 -</p><p>have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. this happens when transplanted cells 
 attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
 stools. 
 -</p><p>notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse. if you have lymphoma this might include 
 fever, feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss. 
 -</p><p>have an infection. the infection will be treated before the yescarta infusion. 
 -</p><p>have had hepatitis b, hepatitis c or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given 
 yescarta.</p></section><section><header>tests and checks  
 before you are given yescarta your doctor will:</header><p>• check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. • look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given yescarta. • check if your cancer is getting worse. • look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. • check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. this will show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. you may be given 
 medicines to help prevent the condition. 
 • check for hepatitis b, hepatitis c or hiv infection. • check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months.</p></section><section><header>after you have been given yescarta  
 tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following:</header><p>• chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat, which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome. take 
 your temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with yescarta. if your temperature is 
 high, see your doctor immediately. 
 • fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
 • fever, which may be a symptom of an infection. • extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red blood cells. 
 • bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood known as platelets.</p><p>
 your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
 components may decrease.</p><p>
 do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
 yescarta. your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with yescarta.</p><p>
 in some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with yescarta. for 
 example:</p><p>
 -</p><p>if yescarta infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received preparatory 
 chemotherapy you may have to receive more preparative chemotherapy.</p><p>38</p></section><section><header>children and adolescents</header><p>yescarta must not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and yescarta</header><p>tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p><p>
 before you are given yescarta tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
 your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
 yescarta.</p><p>
 in particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
 • in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting chemotherapy) to prepare your body for the yescarta cells. 
 • during yescarta treatment. • after treatment while the immune system is recovering.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. this is because the effects of yescarta in 
 pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
 breast-fed child. 
 • if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with yescarta, talk to your doctor immediately. 
 • you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. yescarta can only be given if the results show you are not pregnant.</p><p>
 discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received yescarta.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>some people may feel tired, dizzy or have some shaking after being given yescarta. if this happens to you, do not drive or use heavy machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until your doctor tells 
 you that you have completely recovered.</p></section><section><header>yescarta contains sodium</header><p>this medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion bag. this is the equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
 adult.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how yescarta is given</header><p>yescarta will always be given to you by a healthcare professional.</p><p>• since yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you to prepare your medicine. your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in 
 your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). some of your white blood cells are separated from 
 your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. this can take 3 to 6 hours and 
 may need to be repeated. 
 • your white blood cells are sent away to make yescarta. it usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to receive your yescarta therapy but the time may vary. 
 39</p></section><section><header>medicines given before yescarta treatment</header><p>during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given yescarta you may be given other medicines. this is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. these other medicines may include: 
 • paracetamol. • an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.</p><p>
 prior to receiving yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, 
 which will allow your modified white blood cells in yescarta to multiply in your body when the 
 medicine is given to you.</p><p>
 your doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours.</p></section><section><header>how you are given yescarta</header><p>yescarta will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre.</p><p>
 • yescarta is given in a single dose. • your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of yescarta through a catheter placed into your vein (
 intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. • yescarta is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells. your healthcare professional handling the treatment will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves 
 and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local 
 guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material to clean up or dispose of any 
 material that has been in contact with it.</p><p>
 you must receive yescarta infusion in a qualified clinical facility and be discharged only when your 
 doctor thinks it is safe for you to go home. 
 your doctor may do blood tests to check for side effects.</p></section><section><header>after you are given yescarta</header><p>• plan to stay within proximity from the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after you have been given yescarta. your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily 
 for at least 10 days and will consider whether you need to stay at the hospital as an in-patient for 
 the first 10 days after infusion. this is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and 
 help you if you have any side effects.</p><p>
 if you miss any appointments, call your doctor or the qualified clinical facility as soon as possible to 
 reschedule your appointment.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p><p>

 44</p></section><section><header>the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</header><p>it is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering yescarta.</p><p> 
 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product • yescarta contains genetically-modified human blood cells. local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material applicable for such products must be followed. 
 • yescarta must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers. • yescarta is prepared from autologous blood of the patient collected by leukapheresis. patient leukapheresis material and yescarta may carry a risk of transmitting infectious viruses to 
 healthcare professionals (hcp) handling the product. accordingly, hcp must employ 
 appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) when handling leukapheresis material or 
 yescarta to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases. 
 • work surfaces and materials that have potentially been in contact with yescarta must be decontaminated according to local guidelines on the handling of waste of human-derived 
 materials.</p><p>
 preparation for infusion • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the yescarta cassette.</p><p>• the yescarta product bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. 
 • once the patient’s id is confirmed, remove the yescarta product bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is 
 compromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material (or 
 immediately contact kite). 
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. • thaw yescarta at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. yescarta must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new medium prior to infusion. thawing</p><p>takes 
 approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, yescarta is stable at room temperature (20˚c - 25˚c) for up to 3 hours.</p><p>• however, yescarta infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 do not use a leukodepleting filter.</p><p>
 administration • the medicine must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with experience in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and 
 management of patients treated with yescarta.</p><p>
 • ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. hospitals should have access to an additional 
 dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional case where 
 tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the european medicines agency 
 shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable alternative measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab 
 are available on-site. 
 • the patient’s identity must be matched with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag.</p><p>• yescarta is for autologous use only.</p><p>• yescarta must be administered as an intravenous infusion using latex-free intravenous tubing without a leukocyte depleting filter within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>
 • gently agitate the bag during yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. all contents of the infusion bag must be infused.</p><p>
 • sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) solution for injection must be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. when the full 
 45 volume of yescarta has been infused, the infusion bag must be rinsed with 10 to 30 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure as many cells as 
 possible are infused into the patient.</p><p>
 disposal of yescarta • any unused medicinal product or waste material that has been in contact with yescarta (solid and liquid waste) must be handled and disposed in accordance with local guidelines on the 
 handling of waste of human-derived material. work surfaces and material which have 
 potentially been in contact with yescarta must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.</p><p>
 accidental exposure</p><p>• accidental exposure to yescarta must be avoided. local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material must be followed in case of accidental exposure, which may include 
 washing of the contaminated skin, and removal of contaminated clothes.
