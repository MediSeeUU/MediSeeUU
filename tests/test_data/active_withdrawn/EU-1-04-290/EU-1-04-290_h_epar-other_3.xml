 introduction</header><p>alimta (pemetrexed) is an antifolate that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting the folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
 in vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (ts), 
 dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (garft) which are 
 crucial for the 
 de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed with prolonged intracellular half-life result in prolonged pemetrexed drug action in 
 malignant cells. 
 alimta 
 was 
 granted 
 a 
 marketing 
 authorisation 
 (ma) 
 in 
 the 
 european 
 union 
 (eu) 
 on 
 20 september 2004. alimta is indicated:</p><p>- in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable 
 malignant pleural mesothelioma; 
 - in combination with cisplatin for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology; 
 - as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
 cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has not progressed 
 immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. first line treatment should be a platinum doublet 
 with gemcitabine, paclitaxel or docetaxel; 
 - as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
 non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
 with this variation application the marketing authorisation holder (mah) of alimta proposed to extend 
 the nsclc maintenance therapy indication to all patients that have received first-line platinum-based 
 chemotherapy, independently of the type of agent the platinum is combined with. in other words, 
 patients need not have received as first line treament a platinum doublet with gemcitabine, paclitaxel 
 or docetaxel, but any platinum-containing combination. for this new indication, the proposed posology 
 is similar to the one authorised for pemetrexed as a single agent: pemetrexed 500 mg/m
 2 of body surface area (bsa) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 
 21-day cycle. the mah proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the smpc.</p></section><section><header>information on paediatric requirements</header><p>pursuant to article 8 of regulation (ec) n° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an ema decision (p/345/2010) for the following conditions: 
  treatment of lung carcinoma (small cell and non-small cell carcinoma)</p><p>on the granting of a class waiver</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.

 introduction</header><p>lung cancer is among the most frequent types of cancer among european men and women and is one of the few that continues to show an increasing incidence. prognosis is poor with relative 1-year 
 survival rates of approximately 30% and 5-year survival rates around 10%. although the standardised 
 mortality ratio is declining slightly in men it is still rising in women in the vast majority of european 
 countries. 
 lung cancer is subdivided in two groups, the small cell lung cancer (sclc) and the non small cell lung 
 cancer (nsclc). sclc is recognized by its chemo- and radiosensitivity. nsclc is a heterogeneous 
 group of tumours with common treatment and prognosis. nsclc accounts for the vast majority of lung 
 cancers (80%, d’addario et al, 2010
 ). nsclc includes squamous cell carcinoma (40% of cases), adenocarcinoma (35% of cases) and large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma (25% of cases). 
 surgery is the preferred treatment of patients with early disease. however, more than 60-65% of 
 patients present with locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic disease (stage iv) and are not 
 suitable for surgery. patients with inoperable nsclc are typically candidates for chemotherapy 
 (d’addario 
 et al. 2005; azzoli et al. 2009; d’addario et al. 2010; nccn 2011). for patients with a disease staged as iiib or iv the primary goal of therapy is palliative. moderate gains in survival and 
 other outcomes like time to disease progression and quality of life have been shown with platinum-
 based chemotherapy. despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with locally 
 advanced or metastatic nsclc remains poor. only one third of patients obtain an objective response 
 with initial chemotherapy, with an overall survival time of 7 to 13 months (pfister 
 et al. 2004; wakelee and belani 2005; sandler 
 et al. 2006; scagliotti et al. 2008; manegold et al. 2008; levy et al. 2010). platinum-based combination regimens with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or taxanes (paclitaxel or 
 docetaxel) have been the mainstay for the initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nsclc 
 (pfister 
 et al. 2004; nccn 2011). platinum-based doublets are preferred over non-platinum combinations (azzoli 
 et al. 2009). the addition of bevacizumab to standard doublets has been shown to improve upon the standard 
 chemotherapy regimens (sandler</p><p>et al. 2006). the most recent asco, esmo, and nccn guidelines have been updated to add pemetrexed and irinotecan to the list of third generation cytotoxics, as well 
 as the addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based therapy (azzoli 
 et al. 2009; d’addario et al. 2010; nccn 2011). 
 alimta (pemetrexed) was initially authorised in the eu in the indications (combination treatment of) 
 mesothelioma and second line nsclc (as monotherapy). the second line monotherapy nsclc 
 indication, granted based on the results of the jmei pivotal trial, was then both extended and restricted 
 by two variations of the marketing authorisation.</p><p>
 with variation emea/h/c/000564/ii/09 (ec decision date: 8 april 2008) and based on the results of 
 the jmdb pivotal trial, a first-line nsclc indication (in combination with cisplatin) was approved. at the 
 same time, it had become more and more obvious that pemetrexed is active only in non-squamous 
 nsclc histologies. as a result, the first line indication was limited to non-squamous histologies and the 
 originally granted second line was restricted accordingly. 
 a nsclc maintenance indication after first-line chemotherapy was approved in 2009 (variation 
 emea/h/c/00054/ii/15, ec decision date: 02 july 2009) based on the results of one pivotal, 
 multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase iii study (jmen), which compared the 
 efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus bsc with that of placebo plus bsc</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 4/29</p><p>in 663 patients with locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic (stage iv) nsclc who had not progressed after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in combination 
 with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. 
 another agent approved for maintenance treatment of nsclc patients with stable disease after first-
 line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is erlotinib. however, no studies have examined the benefit 
 of maintenance therapy immediately following treatment with a pemetrexed-platinum induction 
 regimen. pemetrexed-containing regimens were not included in previous advanced nsclc 
 maintenance studies, including study jmen (pemetrexed), saturn (erlotinib), and atlas (erlotinib 
 and bevacizumab combination) (ciuleanu 
 et al. 2009; cappuzzo et al. 2010; miller et al. 2009). this question was addressed with the pivotal trial of this variation application, the paramount study

 to take vitamin supplementation and dexamethasone during the maintenance phase of the treatment 
 period to maintain the double-blind design of the study. maintenance therapy continued until the 
 patient met 1 or more of the specified reasons for discontinuation, including progressive disease (pd).</p></section><section><header>objectives</header><p>the objective of this trial was to compare maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus bsc versus placebo plus bsc in patients with stage iiib (with pleural effusion and/or positive supraclavicular 
 lymph nodes) or stage iv non-squamous nsclc whose disease had not progressed during 4 cycles of 
 pemetrexed and cisplatin induction chemotherapy.</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>objective progression free survival (pfs) was the primary efficacy variable in this study. objective pfs time was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the first date of objectively determined 
 pd or death from any cause. for patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who 
 did not have objective pd, pfs was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease 
 assessment. 
 investigator assessments of radiological data were considered primary for the analyses of pfs [and 
 objective tumour response rate (rr)]. an independent review of radiological data (lesion 
 measurements based on ct scans) was conducted and any revisions of measurements resulting from 
 the review were used for sensitivity analyses. 
 secondary endpoints included: overall survival (os), objective tumour response rate (rr) assessed 
 using recist (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors), patient-reported outcomes using the eq-
 5d questionnaire and toxicity [aes rated using the national cancer institute (nci) ctcae (common 
 terminology critertia for adverse events) scale].</p><p>
 overall survival (os)</p><p>time was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death 
 from any cause. for patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date, os was censored at 
 the last contact date (last contact for patients in post-discontinuation period = last known alive date in 
 mortality status). 
 the eq-5d (euroqol group 1990) is a standardised, non-disease-specific instrument for describing and 
 valuing health status that has been used previously with cancer patients (pickard et al. 2007). the eq-
 5d is a self-administered health-status questionnaire consisting of 2 parts.</p><p>
  the first part includes 5 descriptive questions relating to mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, on which the patient is required to rate his/her health. 
 each attribute has 3 levels: no problem, some problems, and major problems, thus defining 243 
 possible health states, to which has been added “unconscious” and “dead” for 245 in all.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 7/29</p><p> the second part of the eq-5d is a visual analogue scale (vas) that allows patients to rate their present health condition. possible scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best 
 imaginable health state). 
 the 245 health states defined by the 5-dimensional descriptive system can be converted into a 
 weighted health-state index by applying a method described in detail by dolan (1997). this method 
 permits the measurement of preferences. the possible values for health utility ranges from -0.59 
 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension) on a scale where 0 
 represents death and 1 represents the best possible health state (shaw et al. 2005). the eq-5d has 
 been translated and validated into 102 official languages, including french, german, and spanish. the 
 eq-5d was completed by only those patients for whom a translation is available in his/her native 
 language. patients were expected to complete the questionnaire at the following times: 
  at baseline, after consent  on day 1 of each cycle of induction therapy (the cycle 1 day 1 assessment does not have to be completed if the baseline assessment is completed within 7 days prior to day 1 of cycle 1) 
  on day 1 of each cycle of maintenance therapy</p><p> at the 30-day post-discontinuation visit - assessments were completed prior to treatment administration on days that the patient received therapy.</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>the sample size of 558 randomised patients was derived assuming the true os hazard ratio (hr) was 0.70 and assuming 390 events (30% censoring) in the final analysis of os. this sample size was 
 selected for this study to provide 93% statistical power for the final analysis of os. under the 
 assumption that the true pfs hazard ratio (hr) was 0.65, the primary unadjusted log-rank test of pfs 
 had 90% power to show a statistically significant difference between arms provided that there were at 
 least 238 events included in the analysis. therefore, the primary analysis of pfs was to occur after at 
 least 238 events (57% censoring) of progressive disease or death were confirmed among randomised 
 patients.</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio, allocating twice as many patients to the pemetrexed plus bsc arm. randomisation was stratified for the following 3 prognostic factors after completion of the first 4 
 cycles of induction chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin: ecog ps just prior to randomisation 
 (0 versus 1), tumour response to induction chemotherapy (cr/pr versus sd) and disease stage prior 
 to administration of induction therapy (iiib versus iv).</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>this was a double-blind study.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>baseline and efficacy analyses used the itt population which included all patients who were randomised (analysed by treatment arm as randomised). 
 all patients enrolled in the study (treated with at least 1 dose of pemetrexed or cisplatin during the 
 induction phase) were evaluated for safety.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 8/29</p><p>the type 1 (alpha) error was controlled for the analyses of both pfs and os, in order to maintain an overall 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, using the following statistical gate-keeping and alpha-spending 
 scheme: 
  the primary statistical test of pfs was performed using a nominal 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  a 2-sided nominal alpha level of 0.05 was divided between two preliminary and one final analysis of os: a nominal 2-sided level of 0.0001 was spent for each preliminary analysis of os, leaving a 
 nominal level of 0.0498 to be spent for the final analysis of os. if the primary test of pfs was 
 statistically significant, then by application of statistical gate-keeping the overall 2-sided alpha 
 level was maintained at 0.05.</p></section><section><header>results participant flow 
  recruitment</header><p>the first patient was enrolled on 19 november 2008 and the last patient was enrolled on 23 april 2010. at the clinical cut-off date (30 june 2010) 179 patients (pemetrexed: 136, placebo: 43) were still 
 receiving maintenance treatment.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 page 9/29</p></section><section><header>conduct of the study</header><p>there were 2 amendments to the study protocol. the original trial sample size (570 patients treated in induction, 399 patients randomised to maintenance treatment) was selected based on a power 
 calculation for the analysis of pfs, assuming a hr of 0.70 and 25% censoring.</p><p>
 the protocol was amended on 06 october 2008 to include a power calculation for the analysis of os. 
 the new sample size determined that 600 patients treated in induction were needed to provide 372 
 patients randomised to maintenance treatment. the calculation assumed a pfs hr of 0.65 and 36% 
 censoring for pfs, and an os hr of 0.70 and 30% censoring for os. the trial would be fully powered 
 for pfs (90%) and os (80%). 
 the protocol was amended on 20 july 2009 to increase the power of the os analysis by increasing the 
 number of patients entering the induction and maintenance treatment periods. the new sample size 
 determined that 900 patients treated in induction were needed to provide 558 patients randomised to 
 maintenance treatment. the calculation assumed a pfs hr of 0.65 and 52% censoring for pfs, and an 
 os hr of 0.70 and 30% censoring for os. 
 the increase in survival to at least 390 events increased the power of the analysis from 80% to 93%; 
 for pfs, 90% power was maintained, provided that at least 238 events were included in the analysis. 
 the final a priori sap (version 2) was finalised and approved (30 june 2010) prior to data lock and 
 unblinding of the aggregate database for the final pfs analysis. 
 a total of 96 randomised patients (17.8%) were reported to have at least 1 protocol violation. the only 
 identified protocol violations for the randomised patient population were for the incorrect dose 
 modification category (9.5%) and the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria category (8.5%). protocol 
 inclusion/exclusion criteria violations included continuing study treatment after pd (4.1%), 
 randomisation even though response to induction treatment was not cr, pr, or sd (3.2%), 
 randomisation with &lt;4 cycles of induction treatment (1.5%), and randomisation even though ps was 
 not 0 or 1 following induction treatment (0.6%). in general, protocol violations in this study were 
 balanced between study arms.</p></section><section><header>baseline data</header><p>the study arms were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics (see table 1 below). among all patients randomised, the median age was 61.4 years, and the majority of patients were caucasian 
 (94.6 %), male (58.1 %), and reported a history of smoking (77.7%). the two treatment arms were 
 also balanced in terms of stratification factors (table 2), histological type of nsclc (table 3) and

 the independent central review on 471 patients (316 patients in the pemetrexed arm and 156 patients 
 in the placebo arm) yielded a tumour rr of 2.8% in the pemetrexed arm and 0.6% in the placebo arm 
 (p=0.176). the independently reviewed disease control rate (dcr) was 71.8% for patients receiving 
 pemetrexed and 59.6% for patients receiving placebo (p=.009).</p></section><section><header>patient-reported outcomes using the euroqol 5-dimensional scale</header><p>compliance during the maintenance treatment was 46.2% (163 of 359 patients completed the required questionnaire at each of their visits) for the pemetrexed arm and 44.1% (79 of 180 patients completed 
 the required questionnaire at each of their visits) for the placebo arm. for the post-discontinuation 
 visit, where the majority of worsening might have been anticipated, 43.9% of patients in the 
 pemetrexed and 44.3% of patients in the placebo arm completed the eq-5d. the most commonly 
 reported reason for not completing the eq-5d was failure by the investigative site to administer the 
 questionnaire. 
 the eq-5d united kingdom (uk) population-based index score was generated from patient responses 
 to items on mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. no statistical 
 differences in the index scores were observed between the pemetrexed and placebo arms of the study. 
 no statistical changes from baseline in index score at a given time point occurred over the course of 
 maintenance therapy for the within-patient population regardless of treatment arm. at the 
 discontinuation visit, the index score decreased from baseline for patients in both treatment arms. the 
 index score of the pemetrexed arm was 0.77 at baseline and 0.66 at discontinuation (p&lt;.001) and 
 0.79 at baseline and 0.70 at discontinuation (p=0.022) for placebo.</p><p>
 no statistical differences in vas scores were observed between patients treated with pemetrexed and 
 patients treated with placebo. within both treatment arms, the vas scores indicated an increasing 
 trend toward “best-imaginable health state” with some significant increases from baseline at various 
 time points. however, at discontinuation, patients receiving pemetrexed reported a significant</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 15/29</p><p>decrease in health state compared to baseline. patients receiving placebo experienced a similar decrease at discontinuation. based on the eq-5d index scores and vas scores, these results suggest 
 that patients treated with pemetrexed did not experience worse health states over the course of 
 maintenance therapy compared to patients treated with placebo.</p></section><section><header>ancillary analyses</header><p>the mah submitted a number of ancillary analyses for the primary endpoint of pfs including a covariate-adjusted analysis (data not shown) and an independent review of data. more specifically, the 
 mah established an independent review of pfs to assess the potential for investigator bias in the 
 determination of pd between study arms. of the 539 randomised patients with investigator assessed 
 pfs, reviewable scans for 472 patients (87.4%, 316 in the pemetrexed arm and 156 in the placebo 
 arm) were available for the independent review. the majority of unread scans were due to patients not 
 completing 1 cycle of treatment by the data cut-off date (30 june 2010). reasons for patients omitted 
 from the independent review were balanced between study arms. 
 independently assessed median pfs following induction therapy was 3.94 months in the pemetrexed 
 arm and 2.6 months in the placebo arm. the treatment effect was statistically significant (hr = 0.64; 
 95% ci: 0.51 to 0.81; wald’s p =.00025). 
 the mah also submitted sensitivity analyses for pfs using alternative censoring rules (data not 
 shown).</p></section><section><header>clinical studies in special populations</header><p>subgroup analyses based on age and gender are presented in figure 3. the majority of patients were caucasian (94.6% of patients) and patient numbers from other ethnic origins were too small to draw 
 meaningful conclusions.</p></section><section><header>supportive studies</header><p>no supportive studies were submitted. the mah made reference to the previously submitted jmen (maintenance treatment after induction with a platinum doublet that did not include pemetrexed) and 
 jmdb (first line treatment) trials, but no updated data/analyses from these studies were presented.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>the present application for extension of the alimta maintenance therapy indication after first line treatment of nsclc is mainly based on the paramount pivotal study. paramount is the first nsclc 
 trial investigating pemetrexed only in patient who have a cancer with non-squamous histology. this 
 can be considered as a consequence of preceding variation procedures limiting the original second line 
 indication, and the first line (as well as the maintenance) indication of pemetrexed to specific nsclc 
 histologies. 
 the selection of placebo plus bsc as comparator is considered as acceptable. of note, maintenance 
 treatment has been challenged in similar settings with various agents, including pemetrexed, following 
 a platinum doublet with gemcitabine, paclitaxel or docetaxel (jmen, see chmp ar on variation 
 emea/h/c/000564/ii/15), suggesting that prolonged therapy could be of benefit especially regarding 
 pfs and possibly os.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 16/29</p><p>a total of 939 patients were enrolled, of which 539 (57.4%) were randomised 2:1 to study arms (pemetrexed arm n = 359; placebo arm n = 180) in the maintenance phase. all enrolled patients had 
 non-squamous histology (no squamous patients were enrolled), and the majority of patients had 
 adenocarcinoma (87.4%). the baseline patient demographic characteristics, disease characteristics, 
 and prognostic factors were globally balanced between the study arms. there was however a slight 
 imbalance in gender (more female patients in the pemetrexed arm). 
 the dose and schedule of pemetrexed were based on the results of studies jmei (second line 
 treatment) and jmen. therefore, patients received either 500 mg/m
 2 pemetrexed or placebo.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>a total of 302 pfs events (pemetrexed: 184, 51.3%; placebo 118, 65.6%) had occurred at the time of database lock; 175 patients (48.7%) in the pemetrexed arm, and 62 patients (34.4%) in the placebo 
 arm were censored for the pfs analysis. 
 this trial met its primary objective, as the analysis showed a statistically significant increase in 
 investigator-assessed pfs for patients treated with maintenance pemetrexed. median investigator-
 assessed pfs was 4.11 months (95% ci 3.15 to 4.57) in the pemetrexed arm and 2.83 months (95% 
 ci 2.60 to 3.12) in the placebo arm. the estimated hr was 0.62 (95% ci: 0.49 to 0.79; wald’s 
 p=0.00007). 
 these results correspond roughly with the results of trial jmen (4.4 months for the alimta arm and 1.8 
 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% ci = 0.37-0.60, p=0.00001; subgroup ‘patients 
 with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology’). 
 a clear difference in pfs could be observed from the second month of treatment. this difference 
 remained in favour of the pemetrexed arm up to 11 months. although results are consistent in 
 subgroups, there are some subgroups for which the 95% ci of hr includes 1, hence no difference 
 could be confirmed statistically (see figure 3). however, few pfs events had occurred in these 
 subgroups thus leading to wide 95% cis. 
 preliminary overall survival results at the time of the pfs analysis were immature with high censoring 
 rates (78.6% and 74.4% for the pemetrexed and placebo arms, respectively). data from a second 
 preliminary os analysis were considerably more mature and the censoring rate was already well below 
 50%, i.e. the number of events was higher than 50% (299 events) and median os had already been 
 reached. this new, second preliminary analysis showed an os benefit for pemetrexed maintenance 
 therapy vs. placebo with a difference in median os of about 2.8 months, which did not reach statistical 
 significance (p=0.0343) at the minimal (0.0001) alpha-level spent. an alpha spending of 0.0498 is still 
 available for the final os analysis.</p></section><section><header>conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>taken together, these results are globally in line with those already submitted, in that pemetrexed monotherapy, administered as maintenance treatment after pemetrexed/cisplatin induction treatment

 deaths. the primary events included febrile neutropenia (2 events), diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction, 
 large intestine perforation, neutropenic colitis, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, multi-organ 
 failure, lung infection and acute renal failure. of all enrolled, but not randomised patients (n=400), 7 
 deaths (1.8%) occurred within 30 days of the last dose of induction treatment; of these, 5 were due to 
 study disease, 1 was due to an ae (cerebro-vascular accident), and 1 was a possibly study drug-
 related death due to dyspnoea. deaths &gt;30 days after last dose of induction treatment occurred in 184 
 (46.0% of 400) patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin. with the exception of 7 deaths due to 
 aes, the cause of death for these patients was listed as disease progression. 
 in the maintenance phase, among all randomised patients (n = 539), 10 on-study deaths occurred (7 
 [1.9%] in the pemetrexed arm and 3 [1.7%] in the placebo arm). of these, 5 were attributed to 
 disease progression (4 in the pemetrexed arm and 1 in the placebo arm). two deaths (1 in each 
 treatment arm) were aes considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug 
 (pneumonia in 1 patient treated with pemetrexed, sudden death in 1 patient treated with placebo). the 
 remaining 3 deaths (2 on pemetrexed, 1 on placebo) were caused by aes not attributed to study drug. 
 moreover, there were 3 additional deaths within 30 days of the last administered maintenance dose (1 
 in the pemetrexed arm and 2 in the placebo arm). the pemetrexed death was due to possibly study 
 drug-related endocarditis. the placebo deaths were due to disease progression. deaths &gt;30 days of 
 the last dose of maintenance treatment occurred in 69 pemetrexed-treated and 41 placebo-treated 
 patients, with the cause of death for the majority of the patients listed as disease progression. 
 compared with the 13 deaths in paramount during maintenance treatment and within 30 days of last 
 dose, there were 21 deaths during the same period in study jmen. in study jmen, 11 (2.5%) deaths 
 were in the pemetrexed arm and 10 (4.5%) were in the placebo arm, and none were considered 
 possibly related to study drug. of the 309 deaths reported in jmen, there were 21 deaths (11 [2.5%] 
 in the pemetrexed arm and 10 [4.5%] in the placebo arm) that occurred while patients were on study 
 or within 30 days of their last study dose. the remaining 278 deaths occurred &gt;30 days after the last 
 study dose. the deaths were primarily related to disease progression. 
 overall, there were no significant differences in the reasons for deaths between the pemetrexed and 
 placebo arms for the integrated analysis of the maintenance treatment period from paramount and 
 study jmen, except for deaths due to disease progression &gt;30 days after last dose (34.5% 
 pemetrexed [n = 800] versus 41.0% placebo [n = 402], p=0.03).</p></section><section><header>saes</header><p>in paramount, the most common saes possibly related to induction treatment were vomiting and nausea, occurring in 2.6% and 2.3% of patients, respectively. eleven (1.2%) patients experienced

 similarly in jmdb, vomiting (4.1%), nausea (3.6%), and anaemia (2.6%) were the most common

 the most common saes reported in the pemetrexed arm were anaemia (2.2%), followed by febrile 
 neutropenia (1.4%). 
 the overall incidence of drug-related saes in the pemetrexed arm of paramount (8.9%) was 
 numerically higher than in jmen (4.3%). the magnitude of change between the pemetrexed and 
 placebo arms was similar between the two studies. consistent with paramount results, anaemia 
 (1.4%) was the most frequently reported sae in jmen. in the integrated analysis of the maintenance 
 treatment period from paramount and jmen, 6.6% of patients in the pemetrexed arm (n = 800) and 
 1.2% of patients in the placebo arm (n = 402) experienced a sae that was considered possibly related 
 to the study drug (p&lt;.01). individual sae terms that occurred significantly higher in the combined 
 pemetrexed arm compared to the combined placebo arm included anaemia (1.8% versus 0%; p&lt;.01) 
 and febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0%; p=.03).</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>in the induction phase of the paramount trial, there was only study-drug-related grade 5 laboratory toxicity (death), i.e. increased creatinine which was reported as a primary event of acute renal failure. 
 possibly study-drug-related grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities reported in ≥1% of patients in paramount 
 included neutrophils/granulocytes, haemoglobin, platelets, and leukocytes. the overall incidence of 
 grade 3/4/5 laboratory toxicities (all enrolled patients) possibly related to pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
 was lower in paramount (13.7%) compared to jmdb (22.6%). 
 in the maintenance phase of the paramount trial, there were no possibly study drug-related grade 5 
 laboratory toxicities (deaths) reported in either study. overall, toxicity was low on both arms in the 
 maintenance treatment period, such that there were few differences between the treatment arms and 
 few patients experiencing clinically important aes. results in the pemetrexed arm of paramount were 
 consistent with the laboratory toxicities seen in study jmen. hemoglobin and neutrophils/granulocytes 
 were the most common possibly study-drug-related grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities in the 
 pemetrexed arm of both studies, with incidences higher in paramount than in jmen. in the integrated 
 analysis of the maintenance treatment period from paramount and jmen, the overall incidence of 
 grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities possibly related to study treatment was significantly different in the 
 pemetrexed arm compared to the placebo arm (7.5% versus 1.5%, p&lt;0.01). the following individual 
 possibly study-drug-related grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities were reported in significantly more patients 
 on pemetrexed versus placebo treatment arm: haemoglobin (3.5% versus 0.5%; p&lt;0.01), leukocytes 
 (1.6% versus 0.2%; p = 0.04), neutrophils/granulocytes (3.3% versus 0%; p&lt;0.01), and platelets 
 (1.6% versus 0.2%; p = 0.04).</p></section><section><header>safety in special populations</header><p>the mah provided safety analyses from the paramount study based on age (&lt;65 years and years), gender (male, female) and ethnic origin (asian, black/african american, caucasian) and comparisons 
 of the induction and maintenance phase of this study with studies jmdb and jmen, accordingly. the 
 safety profile was similar in the age and gender subgroups across the various trials and no age- or 
 gender-specific differences in toxicity were noted (data not shown). no meaningful conclusions could 
 be made for ethnic subgroups, as the number of non-caucasian patient was minimal.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 page 24/29</p></section><section><header>discontinuation due to adverse events</header><p>fifty-one (5.4%) patients discontinued induction treatment because of possibly study-drug-related aes, the majority (16 [1.7%]) were attributable to a decrease in renal function. similarly, renal 
 toxicities were the most common causes of possibly study-drug-related discontinuation in study jmdb 
 (possibly drug-related events of blood creatinine, increased blood creatinine, decreased creatinine 
 clearance, renal failure, acute renal failure, renal impairment, or renal infarct caused discontinuations 
 for 32 patients [3.8%] on the pemetrexed plus-cisplatin arm). 
 nineteen (5.3%) patients in the pemetrexed arm and 6 (3.3%) patients in the placebo arm 
 discontinued study therapy because of study-drug-related aes. the difference between the 2 treatment 
 arms was not significant and no significant differences were observed between the study arms in the 
 incidence of individual study-drug-related aes leading to discontinuation. the majority of non-serious 
 drug-related aes causing discontinuation (6 patients) from the paramount pemetrexed arm were 
 attributed to asthenia, fatigue, and renal failure (2 patients each). seven patients discontinued from 
 pemetrexed therapy because of study-drug-related saes (1 patient each, bone marrow failure, 
 anaemia, thrombocytopenia, arrhythmia, odynophagia, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia). two 
 patients discontinued from placebo therapy because of study-drug-related saes [sudden death (1) and 
 dehydration (1)]. 
 the type of possibly study-drug-related aes causing discontinuation in paramount during 
 maintenance treatment was similar to that seen in trial jmen. in trial jmen, 3.8% of pemetrexed-
 treated patients discontinued because of drug-related aes (both serious and nonserious) and 0.2% 
 discontinued because of drug-related saes.</p></section><section><header>post marketing experience</header><p>it is estimated that approximately 491,368 patients have been exposed to pemetrexed worldwide since it was first approved on 04 february 2004 to 31 august 2010 if the patients received an average of 4 
 cycles and 655,158 patients if they received an average of 3 cycles.</p><p>
 a total of 2497 spontaneous ae case reports containing 6197 events were identified. of the 6197 aes, 
 3096 were classified as serious (1649 listed, 1477 unlisted) and 3101 were nonserious (1866 listed, 
 1235 unlisted). 
 the meddra system organ classes (socs) with the highest proportion of events were general

 gastrointestinal disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders. 
 overall, the most frequently reported unlisted events (&gt;1%) were malignant neoplasm progression 
 (3.31%; 205/6197), dyspnoea (1.18%; 73/6197), and death (1.02%; 63/6197). 
 a review of the 368 fatal case reports, including the 63 reports with death coded as an event, did not 
 identify any significant new safety information. there were no new trends associated with non-serious 
 and serious events that were already listed in the core company data sheet (ccds) for pemetrexed. 
 in 19.1% (476/2497) of case reports, the patient received a platinum agent (either cisplatin or 
 carboplatin) in combination with pemetrexed as part of combination chemotherapy treatment.</p></section><section><header>discussion and conclusions on clinical safety</header><p>in the pivotal study paramount, 56 deaths occurred during induction treatment of which 11 were due to study drug-related ae. among the 15 death due to unrelated ae, 4 were secondary to pulmonary

 page 25/29</p><p>jmdb study. increased toxicity could be explained by a higher exposure to pemetrexed-cisplatin (up to 6 cycles) during induction in jmdb in comparison to the paramount induction treatment (4 cycles). 
 however, no new safety signal emerged from the comparison of the paramount induction treatment 
 and jmdb. overall, the safety results observed in the paramount study are consistent with the known 
 safety profile of pemetrexed.</p><p>
 during maintenance treatment, there was no difference between placebo and pemetrexed arms in 
 term of deaths. 
 as expected, more patients in the pemetrexed arm had dose delays due to adverse events (20.1%) in 
 comparison to the placebo arm (14.4%). the most common reasons for dose delays in active arm 
 were aes related to haematotoxicity (anaemia, neutropenia, leucopenia, haemoglobin decreased). 
 similarly, dose reductions were more frequent in the pemetrexed arm (3.1%) in comparison to the 
 placebo arm (0.6%). all the dose reductions were due to aes.</p><p>
 during maintenance treatment, frequencies of saes and related saes were higher in the pemetrexed

 significant. overall, 14 patients (3.9%) in the pemetrexed arm and 3 (1.7%) in the placebo arm 
 discontinued treatment due to saes.</p><p>

 benefit-risk balance 
 benefits</header><p> beneficial effects the present application for extension of the existing alimta maintenance indication after first line 
 treatment of nsclc is mainly based on the paramount pivotal study, which is a multicentre, 
 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase iii study designed to compare maintenance 
 therapy with pemetrexed plus bsc versus placebo plus bsc in terms of objective pfs time in patients 
 with stage iiib or stage iv non-squamous nsclc whose disease has not progressed during 4 cycles of 
 pemetrexed and cisplatin induction chemotherapy. 
 this trial met its primary objective, as the analysis showed a statistically significant (log rank 
 p=.00006) increase in investigator-assessed pfs for patients treated with maintenance pemetrexed.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 26/29</p><p>median investigator-assessed pfs was 4.11 months (95% ci 3.15 to 4.57) in the pemetrexed arm and 2.83 months (95% ci 2.60 to 3.12) in the placebo arm. 
 the hr was 0.62 (95% ci: 0.49 to 0.79; wald’s p=.00007) which represents a 38% reduction in the 
 risk of disease progression for patients receiving pemetrexed.</p><p>independently assessed median pfs 
 following induction therapy was 3.94 months in the pemetrexed arm and 2.6 months in the placebo 
 arm. the treatment effect was statistically significant (hr = 0.64; 95% ci: 0.51 to 0.81; wald’s p 
 =.00025). 
 a clear difference in pfs could be observed from the second month of treatment. this difference 
 remained in favour of the pemetrexed arm up to 11 months. although results are consistent in 
 subgroups, there are some subgroups for which the 95% ci of hr includes 1, hence no difference 
 could be confirmed statistically (see figure 3). however, few pfs events had occurred in these 
 subgroups thus leading to wide 95% cis. 
 secondary efficacy results showed that the tumour response rate of the maintenance therapy (cr + 
 pr) was 4.2% in the pemetrexed arm and 1.1% in the placebo arm (p=.067). 
 results of the first preliminary survival analysis showed a preliminary improvement of the median of 
 1.57 months. survival was immature with high censoring rates (78.6% and 74.4% for the pemetrexed 
 and placebo arms, respectively). for a second preliminary analysis of os results, 299 events had 
 occurred with censoring rates of 48% and 38% in the pemetrexed and placebo arms, respectively. the 
 hazard ratio was 0.78 (95% ci: 0.61 to 0.98; log rank p= 0.034). the median os benefit for patients 
 receiving pemetrexed was 2.76 months. 
  uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects there are no significant uncertainties in the knowledge of the beneficial effects.</p></section><section><header>risks</header><p> unfavourable effects fifty six (56) deaths occurred during induction treatment of which 11 were due to study drug-related 
 aes. among the 15 death due to unrelated aes, 4 were secondary to pulmonary embolism. comparison 
 of data from the paramount and jmdb studies showed a higher toxicity during jmdb. increased 
 toxicity could be explained by a higher exposure to pemetrexed-cisplatin (up to 6 cycles) in 
 comparison to paramount induction treatment (4 cycles). however, no new safety signal emerged 
 from the comparison of the paramount induction treatment and jmdb. overall, the safety results 
 observed in the paramount study are consistent with the known safety profile of pemetrexed.</p><p>
 during maintenance treatment, there was no difference between placebo and pemetrexed arms in 
 term of deaths. as expected more patients in the pemetrexed arm had dose delays due to adverse 
 events (20.1%) in comparison to the placebo arm (14.4%). the most common reasons for dose delays 
 in active arm were aes related to hematotoxicity (anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, haemoglobin 
 decreased). similarly dose reductions were more frequent in pemetrexed arm (3.1%) in comparison to 
 the placebo arm (0.6%). all the dose reductions were due to aes.</p><p>
 during maintenance treatment, frequencies of saes and related saes were higher in the pemetrexed 
 arm. however, due to the small number of saes, the difference between both arms was non-
 significant. overall, 14 patients (3.9%) in the pemetrexed arm and 3 (1.7%) in the placebo arm, 
 discontinued treatment due to saes.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>
 page 27/29</p><p> uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects pulmonary embolism is a newly identified adverse drug reaction (adr) for pemetrexed. as such, it 
 was included in section 4.8 of the smpc and it will be included in the next version of the rmp which 
 the mah proposes to submit in early 2012.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance</header><p> importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</p><p>the gain in median pfs of 1.38 months was highly statistically significant. based on preliminary 
 analyses, a statistically significant difference in os has not been shown, but the preliminary difference 
 in median os of 2.76 months suggests that at least a detrimental effect is unlikely. 
  benefit-risk balance the benefit-risk balance of pemetrexed as maintenance treatment after a first line platinum-
 pemetrexed combination is considered as positive, as the demonstrated statistically significant gain in 
 pfs outweighs the added toxicity of pemetrexed given as maintenance treatment after induction 
 chemotherapy with a platinum-pemetrexed combination.</p></section><section><header>discussion on the benefit-risk balance</header><p>the paramount study added a new piece of information on the use of pemetrexed as maintenance treatment of nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology after first line induction 
 treatment with platinum chemotherapy that included pemetrexed. two questions resulting from the 
 pemetrexed maintenance treatment had been: 1) whether the os benefit observed in trial jmen was 
 only due to the delayed administration of otherwise efficacious pemetrexed and 2) whether 
 pemetrexed maintenance is beneficial (even) after pemetrexed induction. paramount showed that 
 patients derive additional benefit from continuing pemetrexed as maintenance treatment after 
 induction chemotherapy which includes pemetrexed. 
 based on paramount and earlier studies in both maintenance (jmen) and first-line (jmdb) treatment, 
 there is little uncertainty in the knowledge of favourable and unfavourable effects in the use of 
 pemetrexed as maintenance treatment after a first line platinum-pemetrexed combination to change 
 the benefit-risk balance.</p></section><section><header n="4">4.
