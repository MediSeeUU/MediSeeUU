  scientific conclusions and grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
 international non-proprietary name: pemetrexed 
 procedure no.  emea/h/c/psusa/00002330/201502 
 period covered by the psur:  5 february 2012 – 4 february 2015 
       ema/816446/2015  page 2/2</header></section><section><header>scientific conclusions</header><p>taking into account the prac assessment report on the psur for pemetrexed, the scientific conclusions of chmp are as follows:</p><p>
 the mah identified a signal of “immune haemolytic anaemia” during the reporting period. the 
 analysis retrieved 8 cases with a probable or possible causal relationship with pemetrexed. half of 
 the cases were clearly evidenced by the positive direct antiglobulin test and for 2 of those by a 
 reaction between the patient’s serum or plasma with red blood cells in presence of pemetrexed or 
 the presence of spherocytes, reticulocytes and/or nucleated red blood cells. the other 4 cases were 
 evidenced by a positive rechallenge. this risk is already listed with the frequency ‘rare’ in the 
 product information, the type of haemolytic anaemia however is not specified.</p><p>
 therefore, in view of available data regarding immune haemolytic anaemia, the prac considered 
 that changes to the product information were warranted.</p><p>the chmp agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the prac.</p></section><section><header>grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation</header><p>on the basis of the scientific conclusions for pemetrexed the chmp is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing pemetrexed is favourable subject to the proposed 
 changes to the product information. 
 the chmp recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.</p></section></body></xml>
