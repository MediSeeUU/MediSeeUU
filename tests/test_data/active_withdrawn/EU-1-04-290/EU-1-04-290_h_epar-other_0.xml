   worksharing to update section 4.8 of the smpc as 
 requested by chmp following the assessment of the 
 psur covering the period between 05 february 2015

 combining multiple tables of adrs into one table of 
 adrs reported in the pivotal registration trials and 
 during the postmarketing period (both clinical trials 
 and spontaneous reporting), organized by soc with 
 the respective frequency categories. the package 
 leaflet is updated accordingly. in addition an 
 updated rmp version 6.1 has been submitted to

 drug reaction. moreover, the existing warning on 
 avoidance of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
 (nsaids) around the time of pemetrexed administration 
 was expanded to recommend that, if concomitant 
 administration of pemetrexed and nsaids is necessary, 
 patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially 
 myelosupression and gastrointestinal toxicity.

 bullous conditions such as stevens-johnson syndrome and 
 toxic epidermal necrolysis, as well as sepsis and haemolytic 
 anaemia have been reported in patients receiving 
 pemetrexed and the causal association with pemetrexed 
 has not been excluded. moreover, third-space fluid (e.g. 
 pleural effusion or ascites) does not seem to affect the 
 pharmacokinetics of permetrexed and drainage of such 
 fluid may not be necessary prior to pemetrexed 
 administration. finally, the administration of nsaids with 
 long half-lives (such as ibuprofen) in patients with mild to 
 moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at 
 least 5 days prior to, on the day of and at least 2 days after 
 pemetrexed administration.

 these patients and caution exercised with use of other

 intestinal necrosis and typhlitis) have been reported 
 uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed.

 type ii variation, upon request by chmp following the 
 assessment of the 3rd psur, to update sections 4.4 and 
 4.8 of the spc to include information regarding acute renal 
 failure. 
   serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have 
 been reported with pemetrexed alone or in association with 
 other chemotherapeutic agents. many of the patients in 
 whom these occurred had underlying risk factors for the 
 development of renal events including dehydration or pre-
 existing hypertension or diabetes.
   further, the mah has made an editorial change in section 
 4.2 and a minor amendment to the warning regarding 
 yellow fever vaccine in section 4.4 for increased clarity. 
 immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. as 
 a result, concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines 
 (except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not 
 recommended.

 annexes in line with the latest qrd template and to include
