 scientific discussion</header></section><section><header>introduction</header><p>the active substance of alimta is pemetrexed, an antifolate that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting the folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.</p><p>
 in vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (ts), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
 formyltransferase (garft), which are crucial for the 
 de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed and their prolonged intracellular half-life are 
 resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.</p><p>alimta was granted a marketing authorisation (ma) in the european union (eu) on 20 september 
 2004. alimta is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
 patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. alimta is also indicated as monotherapy 
 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after prior 
 chemotherapy.</p><p>
 this type ii variation concerns an extension of indication to include 1st line treatment in combination 
 with cisplatin of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).</p><p>lung cancer</p><p>over one million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in close to one million deaths. it is the second most common cancer in men as well as women, accounting for 
 about 13% of cancer diagnoses, but it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in industrialized 
 countries. nsclc represents about 80% of all lung cancer cases. the most common histologies are 
 epidermoid or squamous cell carcinoma (30-35%), adenocarcinoma (40-45%), and large cell 
 carcinoma (&lt;10%). the frequency of these different histological subsets varies across countries and 
 over time, with a decrease in squamous cell histology in industrialised countries. these histologies are 
 often classified together because approaches to diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and treatment were 
 similar in the past.</p><p>
 surgery is the preferred treatment of patients with early disease. however, in clinical practice, a high 
 proportion of patients with nsclc are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease (approximately 
 30% with locally advanced and 40% with metastatic disease) with the remainder 25-30% presenting 
 with early stage disease. despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with lung 
 cancer remains poor. the 5-year survival rate for patients with nsclc is still only about 15%.</p><p>
 research over the past decades has proven that chemotherapy has a definite role in the treatment of 
 advanced nsclc with incremental advances mainly occurring during the last two decades.</p><p>
 one-year survival rates in patients with advanced nsclc have increased from around 10% without 
 chemotherapy, to 20% with an active single agent, and to 35% with the combination of two active 
 drugs.</p><p>
 platinum-based chemotherapy has emerged as the standard treatment for advanced nsclc. in 1995, a 
 large meta-analysis evaluated first- and second-generation platinum-based regimens (developed in the 
 1980s) and demonstrated a significant increase in median survival of 1.5 months and a 1-year survival 
 rate of 10%, the latter corresponding to a 27% reduction in the probability of death for cisplatin-based 
 therapy, compared with best supportive care.</p><p>
 thus, the current standard of first-line treatment in patients with advanced disease consists of 
 platinum-based doublet regimens (combination of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, doectaxel or paclitaxel 
 with cisplatin or carboplatin) where 1-year survival rates of 33% and 2-year survival rates of 11% 
 have been reported (schiller et al.). the use of doublets as compared to cisplatin monotherapy seems 
 to increase the overall survival and the ttp by approximately 2 months (wozniak et al; sandler et al.).</p><p> page 2 of 36 scope of the variation</p><p>this type ii variation concerns an extension of indication to include 1st line treatment in combination with cisplatin of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer other than 
 predominantly squamous cell histology. in addition, the existing 2
 nd line monotherapy indication has been amended accordingly. sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the spc have been updated and the 
 package leaflet has been updated accordingly.</p><p>
 further, the marketing authorisation holder (mah) has updated annex iib to include a reference to 
 the pharmacovigilance system (version 2.0) and the risk management plan (version 1.2) agreed with 
 the chmp.</p><p>
 in addition, the mah took the opportunity to make a minor change to section 4.5 of the spc regarding 
 concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and to make minor editorial</p><p>changes to the spc and 
 package leaflet.</p><p>
 for this new indication, the proposed posology is similar to the one authorised for pemetrexed in 
 combination with cisplatin in the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable 
 malignant pleural mesothelioma: pemetrexed 500 mg/m
 2 of body surface area (bsa) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle; cisplatin is 75 mg/m
 2 bsa infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</p><p>the new first line nsclc indication is supported by</p><p>one pivotal, controlled, phase 3 study, h3e-mc-
 jmdb (jmdb), which evaluated the efficacy of pemetrexed plus cisplatin (ac) versus gemcitabine 
 plus cisplatin (gc) as the initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nsclc in 1725 patients.</p></section><section><header>non-clinical aspects</header><p>the non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of pemetrexed disodium were evaluated in a battery of non-clinical studies that were discussed as part of the initial marketing 
 authorisation application (maa) for malignant pleural mesothelioma (mpm) and previously treated 
 non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).</p><p>with reference to this new application (ii/09), previous findings 
 were summarised by the applicant, followed by a discussion focused on new data.</p><p>only the new non-
 clinical information included in this submission was assessed in this report, including:</p><p>
 safety pharmacology:</p><p>
 - 031216-fmd:</p><p>effects of ly231514 disodium (compound 289739) on cloned herg channels 
 expressed in mammalian cells.</p><p>
 repeat-dose toxicology:</p><p> 
 - wil-353055:</p><p>a repeat-dose study in cd-1 mice given ly231514 disodium (compound 289739) 
 weekly by intraperitoneal injection for 6 months</p><p>
 - 500415:</p><p>a repeat dose toxicity study in the beagle dog given ly231514 disodium (compound 
 289739) by intravenous slow bolus injection every 3 weeks for 9 months (14 doses)</p></section><section><header>glp compliance</header><p>these safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies were performed in accordance with good laboratory practice (glp) regulations and were consistent with the organisation for economic 
 cooperation and development (oecd) standards in effect at the time.</p></section><section><header>safety pharmacology</header><p>the objective of study 031216 was to examine the in vitro effects of ly231514 disodium (permetrexed) on ikr current, recapitulated by transfecting the herg gene in hek 293 cells. each of 
 page 3 of 36 three concentrations of ly231514 (30, 100 and 300 µm) was applied for 8 min to 3 cells. the results were compared to that of a control solution as well as the positive control e4031 (500 nm). to elicit 
 ikr “tail” currents chantest used a prepulse to +20 mv followed by a ramp (-0.5 v/sec) to -80 mv, 
 which, in their hands, yields a greater sensitivity than a “step” protocol.</p><p> 
 in these conditions, permetrexed neither did significantly block herg currents nor differ from control 
 [-0.5 to +0.7% blockade as compared to +0.3% for control]. no ic20 or ic50 could be deducted from 
 these experiments due to the lack of effect, confirmed by the fact that a 500 nm concentration of 
 e4031 significantly blocked herg currents by 89%. 
 based on these data, unbound concentrations of up to at least 300 µm permetrexed (~128 µg/ml) or 
 total plasma concentration of ~ 651 µg/ml are not expected to block ikr or induce a qt prolongation 
 subsequent to that mechanism.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>since the initial indication for malignant mesothelioma and previously-treated nsclc, a 6-month repeat dose study in mice and a 9-month repeat dose study in dogs were conducted to support 
 registration in japan.</p><p>
 generally, the toxicity observed in these repeat-dose studies were similar to that observed in shorter 
 duration studies.</p><p>in mice, the primary effects were on the testis and included decreased testicular 
 weight, degeneration of testicular seminiferous tubules, hyperplasia of interstitial (leydig) cells, and 
 reduced epididymal spermatozoa.</p><p>in dogs the effects typical of a cytotoxic agent were observed and 
 included emesis, reduced food consumption resulting in minor fluctuations in body weight, decreases 
 in erythrocytes and/or leukocyte counts and in platelet counts, and hematopoietic hypocellularity in 
 bone marrow. these effects were similar to those observed in the 6-month repeat-dose study in dogs; 
 however, the hematotoxicity was not as severe due to the change in dosing regimen from once a week 
 in the 6-month study to once every 3 weeks in the 9-month study.</p><p>additional changes observed in the 
 9-month study included decreased testes weight with degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous 
 epithelium and minimal-to-slight renal tubular karyomegaly and degeneration with no organ weight or 
 clinical pathology correlates.</p><p>the effects on the testes, although not seen in previous studies (possibly 
 due to the age of the dogs), were entirely expected based on the effects in the mouse and the cytotoxic 
 nature of pemetrexed (this finding from study 500415 has previously been included in the spc.</p><p>the 
 effects on the kidney were observed in male dogs only and the overall mild nature of this change was 
 further substantiated by the lack of concurrent compound-related changes in kidney weights, and the 
 absence of any changes in clinical pathology parameters indicative of primary renal injury or 
 dysfunction, even after 9 months of treatment.</p><p>the effects of pemetrexed on renal function were 
 closely monitored in the pivotal phase iii clinical trials and no adverse findings were observed on 
 renal function.</p></section><section><header>discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>an extensive series of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies in animals have been conducted with pemetrexed disodium and were provided in the initial marketing authorisation 
 application.</p><p>protocols for the recently completed safety pharmacology and toxicology studies meet 
 current international regulatory guidelines.</p><p>the format and presentation of the data were appropriate 
 and the studies were performed in line with glp regulations.</p><p>
 the effects noted in these studies were consistent with the information provided in section 5.3 of the 
 spc and do not change the safety profile of pemetrexed.</p><p>the spc adequately reflects knowledge of 
 the pharmacological and toxicological properties of pemetrexed disodium and includes appropriate 
 advice on reproductive risks and breast feeding and information on genotoxic potential.</p><p>ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</p><p> the mah has also provided an environmental risk assessment (era) as part of the current application for the use of pemetrexed as first line treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma. however, this era 
 does not completely fulfil the phase ii requirements of the current guideline on the environmental 
 page 4 of 36 risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (chmp/swp/4447/00).</p><p>as a consequence, the mah has agreed to conduct the requested phase ii studies as a post-opinion commitment.</p></section><section><header>clinical aspects  
 gcp compliance</header><p>all clinical studies included in the dossier have been conducted in compliance with the principles of good clinical practice (gcp).</p></section><section><header>clinical pharmacology</header><p>two phase i dose-escalation studies with pemetrexed were provided as part of this application; study h3e-mc-jmas (jmas) and study h3e-je-1001 (1001).</p><p> 
 further, pk interaction of pemetrexed and cisplatin was investigated in study h3e-je-me01 (me01) 
 in japanese patients. 
 in addition, this application included new pd (sub-) studies in second line treatment of nsclc 
 (studies jmgx and ns01) and a biomarker sub-study of the pivotal study jmdb (study jmdb-
 pgx).</p></section><section><header>- study h3e-mc-jmas</header><p>study jmas was a phase 1 dose-finding study of pemetrexed administered with high-dose folic acid (fa) or standard-dose fa supplementation through multivitamins (mv) in patients with locally 
 advanced or metastatic cancer.</p><p>
 the</p></section><section><header>primary objective</header><p> of this study was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) of pemetrexed when administered as a 10-minute infusion every 3 weeks given with oral folic acid 
 supplementation for 2 days prior, the day of, and for 2 days after study drug administration in patients 
 with locally advanced or metastatic cancer.</p><p>
 the</p></section><section><header>secondary objectives</header><p> of this study were: -to determine the quantitative and the qualitative toxicities of pemetrexed with folic acid alone or 
 multivitamin supplementation,</p><p>
 -to determine the recommended dose for pemetrexed with folic acid and with multivitamin 
 supplementation for future studies,</p><p> 
 -to assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed with folic acid and with multivitamin 
 supplementation,</p><p>
 - to document antitumor activity of pemetrexed with folic acid and with multivitamin supplementation, 
 and</p><p>
 -to determine the folate status of patients.</p><p>
 patients were classified according to pretreatment status.</p><p>lightly pretreated patients (lpt) were those 
 who received no prior treatment, up to 2 courses of mitomycin-c, up to 6 courses of an alkylating 
 agent, or up to 4 courses of carboplatin.</p><p>heavily pretreated patients (hpt) were those who previously 
 received more than one of these treatments for their cancer, or any radiotherapy to the pelvic region.</p><p> 
 thus, 4 cohorts of patients (fa_hpt, fa_lpt, mv_hpt, and mv_lpt) were enrolled in the study 
 consisting of 127 patients (72 male and 55 female), of which 99 patients (59 male and 40 female) were 
 included in the pharmacokinetic analyses.</p><p> 
 pemetrexed doses ranging from 600 mg/m
 2</p><p>to 1400 mg/m
 2</p><p>were administered as a 10-minute 
 intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.</p><p> page 5 of 36 mtd results</p><p>pharmacokinetics results plasma concentration versus time data were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic analysis.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed administered as a 10-minute intravenous infusion with vitamin 
 supplementation were characterized by a three-compartment model. population estimates of 
 pemetrexed systemic clearance (cl) and volume of distribution at steady state (vss) were 88.0 
 ml/min and 17.0 l, respectively. pemetrexed (cl) was independent of dose over the dose ranges of 
 571-1413 mg/m
 2 and 888 to 2744 mg m2; therefore auc is dose proportional over these dose ranges.</p><p>
 results from this study demonstrate that pemetrexed pharmacokinetics are linear (that cl is, dose-
 independent over the range of doses studied).</p><p>this indicates that pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
 (auc) and maximum plasma concentration (cmax) increase proportionally with dose. the data are in 
 accordance with the known pk profile of pemetrexed.</p></section><section><header>- study h3e-je-1001</header><p>this was a phase 1 dose-escalation study of pemetrexed in japanese patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer.</p><p>patients were classified according to pre-treatment status.</p><p>pemetrexed doses 
 ranged from 300 mg/m
 2</p><p>to 1200 mg/m
 2</p><p>and were administered as a 10-minute intravenous infusion 
 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.</p><p>pharmacokinetic data were available from 31 patients (20 male and 11 
 female).</p><p>
 the primary pharmacokinetic objective of this trial was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
 ly231514 disodium administered with folic acid and vitamin b12 in japanese patients.</p><p>
 the secondary objectives of this study were: 
 ▪ to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended dose of ly231514 when administered 
 as a 10-minute infusion every 21 days given with folic acid and vitamin b12 to japanese patients with 
 locally advanced or metastatic cancer. 
 ▪ to determine the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of ly231514 administered with folic acid 
 and vitamin b12. 
 ▪ to assess the pharmacokinetics of ly231514 when administered with folic acid and vitamin b12. 
 ▪ to investigate antitumor activity of ly231514 administered with folic acid and vitamin b12.</p><p>
 page 6 of 36 pharmacokinetics results total plasma clearance of pemetrexed was independent of dose with a mean clearance of 81.9 ml/min 
 (clearance ranged from 61.4 to 109 ml/min across all doses in this study).</p><p>steady-state volume of

 concomittant therapy, dose, and mode of administration 
 -patients were required to take an oral multivitamin 1 g (containing folic acid 500 µg) once daily from 
 at least 7 days before day 1 of the scheduled administration of the study drugs in cycle 1. after 
 discontinuing administration of the study drugs, multivitamin was continuously administered until 22 
 days after the last dose of the study drugs if possible. 
 - a vitamin b12 injection at a dose of 1000 µg had to be intramuscularly administered at least 7 days 
 before day 1 of cycle 1, and had to be given approximately every 9 weeks (± 7 days) from the date 
 when vitamin b12 was firstly administered until 22 days after the last dose of the study drugs if 
 possible.</p><p>
 the primary pharmacokinetic objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ly231514 and 
 cisplatin when coadministered in japanese patients and to compare the pharmacokinetics to that 
 characterized in western patients (study h3e-mc-jmch [jmch]).</p><p>
 plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic assessment was conducted in cycles 1 and 3 for 
 characterization of both alimta and total platinum pharmacokinetics.</p><p>

 participated in the sub-study. it was anticipated that from the main trial, about 40% of patients (344 
 patients per treatment arm) should have specimens studied in this sub-study. a total of 366 patients 
 page 8 of 36 were consented for this substudy (in both arms) of whom 232 patients had specimens submitted, 113 on ac and 119 on gc.</p><p>
 the study investigated expression levels of several biomarkers known to be involved in pemetrexed, 
 gemcitabine, and cisplatin mechanisms of action and resistance, including genes involved in the 
 activation and transport, as well as genes believed to have prognostic value in nsclc. biomarkers of 
 interest included thymidylate synthase (ts), folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (fpgs), γ -glutamyl 
 hydrolase (ggh), ribonucleotide reductase m1 (rrm1), deoxycytidine kinase (dck), human 
 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hent1), multidrug resistance protein 5 (mrp5), excision repair 
 crosscomplementing (ercc1), and epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr).</p><p>
 the association between expression levels of biomarkers and survival time was assessed within and 
 between each treatment arm. all patients with clinical outcome data and protein or gene expression 
 data falling within specified reference ranges were included in the analyses.</p><p>
 samples were obtained from 232 patients, 16 of which had insufficient tumour tissue for analysis.</p><p>
 patients with ihc data included 90 patients in treatment arm ac and 91 patients in treatment arm 
 gc. 
 patients with gene expression data within reference range included 26 patients in ac and 43 patients 
 in gc. 
 patients with both gene and protein data (patients with at least 1 result) included 13 patients in ac and 
 21 patients in gc.</p><p>
 in this exploratory study, the data analysis of samples received showed statistically significant patterns 
 in a number of analyses that may be of scientific interest for further investigation. because of the small 
 sample size, results should be considered useful as exploratory analyses but not definitive statements.</p><p>
 • a consistent treatment-independent relationship between higher egfr expression, both for gene as well as protein, and improved clinical outcome for all time-to-event outcomes and 
 best tumour response was observed. 
 • all other markers either showed lower levels of statistical significance or association with fewer clinical outcomes. 
 • for patients treated with ac, there was an association between lower ts mrna expression and better outcomes (increased time-to-progressive disease [ttpd] and time-to-treatment 
 failure [tttf]). conversely for gc, higher ts mrna levels were associated with increased 
 ttpd and tttf. 
 • the analysis uncovered links between high fpgs gene expression and improved ttpd, regardless of treatment. 
 • for patients treated with ac, lower expression of ercc1 was associated with increased tttf. patients with high ercc1 expression showed a trend toward improved progression-free 
 survival (pfs) and ttpd. there was a significant interaction between treatment and baseline 
 ercc1. expression level-dependent treatment effects for pfs and ttpd were identified.</p><p>
 due to the small sample size, results should be considered informative but not confirmatory.</p></section><section><header>- study jmgx</header><p>this was a randomized, open-label, multi-centre, phase 3 study on second-line patients with nsclc comparing overall survival following treatment with pemetrexed 500 mg/m
 2 (=licensed second line monotherapy schedule) versus pemetrexed 900 mg/m
 2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage iii or iv) nsclc who had failed a prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>
 of the 629 patients who entered the study, 588 were randomly assigned to treatment and 41 patients 
 were not. of the 588 patients, 295 patients were randomly assigned to the 500 mg/m
 2 arm and 293 to the 900 mg/m
 2 arm. seven patients were randomized but never treated. during this study, the data monitoring committee (dmc) recommended to discontinue further enrolment and to stop treatment 
 with the higher dose (900 mg/m
 2) of pemetrexed due to lack of evidence to suggest that there would be page 9 of 36 a statistically significant improvement in survival with the higher dose (900 mg/m2) of pemetrexed compared with the standard dose (500 mg/m
 2). fifty-one patients who were still receiving treatment on the 900 mg/m
 2 treatment arm were switched to the 500 mg/m2 treatment arm (the 900-mg/m2 and 500-mg/m
 2 group).</p><p>
 the final efficacy analyses showed no statistically significant difference in overall survival time 
 between the 2 treatment groups (hr 1.0132; 95% ci 0.837, 1.226; p=0.8930). the median survival 
 time was 6.7 months for the 500 mg/m
 2 arm and 6.9 months for the 900 mg/m2 arm. secondary efficacy outcomes included pfs and tumour response rates. the cox proportional hazards 
 model revealed no statistically significant difference in pfs between the 500 mg/m
 2 and 900 mg/m2 treatment groups. median pfs time was 2.6 months in the 500 mg/m2 group and 2.8 months in the 900 mg/m
 2 group. the chi-square test showed no statistically significant difference in the tumour response rate between the 500 mg/m
 2 and 900 mg/m2 groups (7.1% versus 4.3%, p=0.1616). stable disease rates were 50.6% and 53.1%, respectively.</p><p>
 the percentage of serious adverse events (saes) was numerically higher (37.9% versus 32.1%) in the 
 900 mg/m
 2 group compared with the 500 mg/m2 group. the percentage of saes among the 51 patients in the 900 to 500 mg/m

 in general, the frequency of adverse events was similar between the low and high dose of pemetrexed. 
 however, for the following adverse events, more than a 5 percentage point difference in frequency 
 between the 900 mg/m
 2 and 500 mg/m2 groups was observed: anaemia (32.9% versus 22.1%), fatigue (41.7% versus 32.8%), vomiting (20.0% versus 13.1%), 
 thrombocytopenia (11.3% versus 5.5%), and diarrhoea (15.4% versus 10.0%).</p><p>
 this large monotherapy trial in second line nsclc patients overall confirms the ma status of alimta, 
 and suggests that the dosage recommended within the first ma procedure is already near the optimum, 
 both in terms of efficacy and safety.</p></section><section><header>- study ns01</header><p>this was a multi-centre, randomized, open-label clinical trial involving japanese patients with advanced nsclc who previously received systemic chemotherapy (one or two regimens). the 
 planned sample size was 240 patients (120 patients each in the 500 and 1000 mg/m
 2 arms). the actual number of patients assigned to treatment arms was 244. the number of patients actually 
 treated with pemetrexed was 226 patients (114 patients in the 500 mg/m
 2 arm and 112 patients in the 1000 mg/m
 2 arm).</p><p>
 the primary efficacy endpoint in this study was response rate. efficacy analyses were performed for 
 the fas (full analysis set; 216 patients) population based on “best overall response” assessments 
 performed by an independent case judgment committee. 
 best overall responses assessed by the case judgment committee for 108 subjects in the 500 mg/m
 2 group (who met the criteria for fas) were as follows: complete response (cr), n=0; partial response (pr), n=20; stable disease (sd), n=40; progressive disease (pd), n=48; and not evaluable (ne), n=0. 
 the response rate (cr+pr rate) was 18.5% (90% confidence interval (ci): 12.6% to 25.8%). the 
 lower limit of one-sided 95% ci was 12.6%.

 results of trial ns01 both in terms of efficacy and safety confirm the findings and conclusions of trial 
 jmgx and support the approved pemetrexed dose of 500 
 mg/m2.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the results from study h3e-mc-jmas demonstrated that pemetrexed pharmacokinetics are linear (i.e. that cl is dose-independent over the range of doses studied).</p><p>pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
 (auc) and maximum plasma concentration (cmax) increase proportionally with dose. the data are in 
 accordance with the known pk profile of pemetrexed.</p><p>
 the results from study h3e-je-me01</p><p>show, as in the original maa, that the pharmacokinetics of 
 pemetrexed are not altered when administered with cisplatin.</p><p>
 the small number of patients included in the biomarker sub-study preclude any reliable conclusion 
 although the exploratory results suggest that it would have been valuable to have more reliable data 
 available on e.g. egfr and ts expression and correlation with efficacy. there are insufficient data at 
 this time to correlate tumour biomarkers with histology and therapeutic outcomes with pemetrexed.</p><p>
 the large monotherapy trial jmgx in second line nsclc patients confirms that the dosage 
 recommended at the time of the first maa is already near the optimum, both in terms of efficacy and 
 safety. the results of trial ns01 confirm the findings and conclusions of study jmgx and also support

 (gemcitabine plus cisplatin [gc]). patients in both treatment arms received folic acid and vitamin b12 
 and dexamethasone pre-treatment supplementation.</p><p>
 investigational sites involved in study jmdb were invited to participate in an optional companion

 pathological diagnosis (histological versus cytological), and investigative centre.</p><p>
 each patient underwent a treatment period and a follow-up period. the treatment period consisted of 
 treatment cycles, each 21 days long. patients received up to 6 cycles of assigned treatment (control or 
 experimental). the follow-up period began when the treatment period was completed. patients were to 
 be followed up with periodic tumour response evaluation until disease progression. all patients were

 and safety data as compared with other gemcitabine/cisplatin studies. the 21-day regimen of 
 gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin was utilized as a control, as this is a clinical standard 
 regimen in patients with nsclc. in addition, a randomized phase 2 trial suggested that there was 
 similar efficacy and dose intensity in the 21- versus the 28-day regimen (soto parra et al. 2002).</p><p> treatments administered:</p><p> patients were randomized to receive up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed plus

 selection of doses in the study: data from a phase 1 study, h3e-mc-jmap (jmap) of pemetrexed 
 and cisplatin contributed to the selection of the pemetrexed and cisplatin doses for patients assigned to 
 treatment arm a in this study. the maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) for the first cohort was reached 
 at 600 mg/ m
 2 pemetrexed and 100 mg/ m2 cisplatin, with dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) of thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia. the data from this study would have led to a dose of 
 600 mg/ m
 2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 to become the recommended phase 2 dose. however, because of toxicities observed in other single-agent phase 2 studies, the recommended phase 2/3 dose for this 
 combination became 500 mg/ m
 2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/ m2 cisplatin, as used in the pivotal phase 3 study in mesothelioma. the dose of cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine has varied from 75 mg/ 
 m
 2 to 100 mg/ m2 every 21 days. based on the non-inferiority study design of this study, the cisplatin dose was selected to match the treatment arm a cisplatin dose (75 mg/ m
 2).</p><p> prior and concomitant therapy: patients in both treatment groups were fully supplemented with folic 
 acid and vitamin b12, as well as dexamethasone prophylaxis. patients were allowed to receive full 
 supportive-care therapies concomitantly during the study. antiemetics could be used. palliative 
 radiation therapy was permitted for irradiating small areas of painful metastases that could not be 
 managed adequately using systemic or local analgesics. any disease progression requiring other forms 
 of specific antitumor therapy was cause for early discontinuation of study therapy. no other anticancer 
 therapy were permitted while the patients were participating in this study.</p></section><section><header>efficacy and safety variables</header><p>the following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply: -</p></section><section><header>overall survival (os)</header><p>is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.

 risk of death) than that of ac.</p><p>if this hazard ratio is observed and is assumed to be constant, this non-
 inferiority margin would translate into a 17.6% longer median survival for the gc arm.</p><p>therefore, a 
 statistically significant result implies that the median survival for ac is at least 85% as long as that for 
 gc.</p><p>as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, if the 95% confidence interval for hr was found 
 to fall entirely below the margin of 1.17647, the null hypothesis h0 would be rejected at a one-sided

 assumptions.</p><p>
 two interim analyses for futility were planned and conducted per protocol, in may and september 
 2005, respectively. the first interim analysis was planned to occur after approximately 700 patients 
 had been enrolled (after a minimum of 200 patients had progressive disease or had died). dependent 
 on results of the first interim analysis, a second interim analysis was to occur approximately 2 to 3 
 months after the first interim analysis.</p></section><section><header>efficacy analysis</header><p>the primary efficacy analysis was a non-inferiority analysis of os for patients treated with ac compared to patients treated with gc.</p><p> 
 the overall survival hazard ratio (hr) of pemetrexed plus cisplatin over gemcitabine plus cisplatin 
 was assumed to be approximately constant from randomization until death. for the primary analysis of 
 this study, hr was estimated from survival data on all randomized patients using a cox proportional 
 hazards model. this cox model was used for all time-to-event endpoints. in addition, unadjusted 
 analyses were performed for each time-to-event endpoint, based on kaplan meier methods.</p><p>
 non-inferiority p-values were also calculated for both cox adjusted and unadjusted analyses at a one-
 sided, 0.025 significance level. tumour response rate was also summarized and tested for superiority 
 (two-sided, 0.05 significance level) using normal approximation for the difference in rates.</p><p>
 time-to-event hazard ratios (hr) were estimated using cox proportional hazards models using the 
 following baseline covariates: assigned study treatment arm (pemetrexed plus cisplatin [ac] over 
 gemcitabine plus cisplatin [gc]), disease stage (iiib over iv), ecog performance status (0 over 1), 
 sex (female over male), basis for initial pathological diagnosis (histopathological over cytological). 
 the covariates listed above were chosen to correspond with the factors involved in randomization, 
 with the exceptions of investigator site, history of brain metastases, and participation in the biomarker 
 research protocol.</p></section><section><header>patient populations for efficacy analyses</header><p>four different analysis populations were utilized for the analysis of study jmdb:</p><p>- the primary efficacy analyses, as well as baseline characteristics, were based on the</p></section><section><header>intent-to-treat (itt) population</header><p>, consisting of all patients who were randomized (regardless of whether they were treated or not), and analyzed according to the therapy as randomized (regardless of what they

 the post discontinuation systemic anticancer agents received were balanced between treatment arms, with the exception of post-pemetrexed or post-gemcitabine exposure. a very small percentage of 
 patients were reported to receive the same drug (pemetrexed or gemcitabine) post discontinuation as 
 was received according to randomized study treatment, and some patients crossed over to receive the 
 opposite drug in post discontinuation treatment. overall, fewer patients on the ac arm received post 
 discontinuation systemic anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy) 
 than patients on the gc arm (52.6% versus 56.1%), and significantly fewer patients on the ac arm 
 received chemotherapy agents post discontinuation (41.5% versus 47.3%, p=0.018).</p><p>less than 50% of patients in each group completed the 6 cycles of treatment (45.2% for the ac arm 
 and 46.4% for the gc arm). 85.8% of planned mean dose of gemcitabine has been administered 
 compared to 94.8% of pemetrexed, but this is acceptable since the figures are in line with clinical 
 practice and previous studies. active post-discontinuation treatments were given. the proportion of 
 patients who switched after discontinuation of the initial treatment is not negligible in the context of a 
 non-inferiority trial (16.7% of the ac group received gemcitabine and 13.4% of the gc group 
 received premetrexed). however, the mah has provided additional os analyses excluding patients 
 who switched and these analyses are reassuring and support non-inferiority (see below).</p><p>

 additional analyses were performed on the protocol-qualified (pq) population, which includes 
 patients who had eligible study disease, did not take prohibited anticancer therapy, had baseline 
 lesions, and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. of the 1725 patients randomized in this study, 
 1666 were qualified for the pq analyses (838 patients in the ac arm and 828 patients in the gc arm).</p><p>
 overall survival</p><p>for the pq population, the median os time was 10.38 months for the ac arm and 10.45 months for the gc arm. using the cox regression adjusted model, the non-inferiority test of h0 versus ha was 
 statistically significant (one-sided p&lt;0.001), with the cofactor-adjusted survival hr estimated to be 
 0.94 (95% ci: 0.84 to 1.05). for sensitivity, an unadjusted estimate of the analysis of the survival hr 
 was found to be similar (hr = 0.93; 95% ci: 0.83 to 1.04), with a non-inferiority p-value of &lt;0.0001.</p><p>

 independently-reviewed progression-free survival:</p><p>
 a pre-planned limited independent central review of imaging for determination of objective 
 progressive disease was conducted on a subset of 400 patients randomly selected from the first 1000 
 patients enrolled.</p><p>the purpose of this independent review was to look for any evidence of a 
 systematic bias in investigator assessments of progressive disease in terms of the relative efficacy of 
 the 2 treatment arms.</p><p>as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan, if the 2 estimates for hr were 
 found to be similar, then there would be no significant bias from investigator-assessed data, and 
 therefore an evaluation to assess agreement and discordance between independently reviewed and 
 investigator-reviewed pfs would not be necessary. of the 400 patients sampled for review, 333 had 
 reviewable scans. the independent review of 333 patients was consistent with the overall investigator 
 assessment of pfs.</p><p> page 22 of 36</p></section><section><header>summary of progression-free survival time (months) for subset of patients to be independently reviewed investigator and independent assessments h3e-mc-jmdb</header></section><section><header>investigator assessments

 interaction was present.</p><p>
 since there was the potential for imbalances between arms with respect to prognostic factors within 
 histologic groups, this interaction test was performed using a cox model of os with main effects for 
 assigned treatment arm, histology (adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, 
 and other histology as 3 indicator variables), and baseline cofactors of performance status (ecog ps), 
 disease stage, gender, and basis for pathological diagnosis, plus the treatment-by-histology interaction. 
 the interaction was found to be statistically significant (p=0.0058), indicating that there was a 
 significant treatment-by-histology interaction.</p><p>
 page 25 of 36 evaluating this interaction as a two-level histology variable as squamous versus non-squamous also resulted in a significant interaction (p=0.0024).</p><p>in addition, analyses of pfs and response rate for histologic subgroups were generally consistent with 
 the efficacy results shown on overall survival. there were trends for ac to perform better than gc in 
 adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. in squamous cell carcinoma, gc tended to perform better 
 than ac for both pfs and response rate.</p><p>an analysis of overall survival with censoring at pdt was performed upon request by the chmp, and 
 the censoring rate was much higher for this analysis (74% for ac and 76% for gc) than was observed 
 for pfs. the adjusted hr for this analysis (n=1722) was 1.06 (95% ci: 0.90 to 1.24), and the median 
 survival was 14.2 months for ac versus 13.6 months for gc. with such a high censoring rate, in this 
 case greater than 70%, this analysis is not informative and therefore no conclusions can be drawn, as 
 the estimates are based on very few events.</p><p>

 experimental arm a: 
 pemetrexed 500 mg/m

 demographic and tumour characteristics at baseline were well balanced: a total of 1725 patients were 
 enrolled into the study. of the enrolled patients, 862 patients were randomized to the ac arm, and 863 
 patients were randomized to the gc arm. approximately 70% of the patients were men. the median 
 age of 61 years with a wide age range (26 years to 83 years). at study entry, 24% of patients had stage 
 iiib disease and approximately 76% of patients had stage iv disease.</p><p>approximately 36% of patients 
 had an ecog performance status (ps) of 0, and 64% of patients had an ecog ps of 1.</p><p>the arms 
 were well balanced with respect to these well-established prognostic factors, as well as age, history of 
 tobacco use, and histological type (adenocarcinoma</p><p>about 50%, squamous cell carcinoma about one 
 third, large cell carcinoma about 8%, and other histologies about 15%).</p><p>
 the primary efficacy analysis was a non-inferiority analysis of overall survival (os) for patients 
 treated with ac compared to patients treated with gc based on the itt population.</p><p>a non-inferiority 
 fixed margin of 1.17647 was used, which corresponded to gc having a 15% lower hazard than that of 
 ac, and was tested at a one-sided 0.025 alpha level. 
 this non-inferiority margin may appear large and does not exclude a significant disadvantage when 
 using pemetrexed in the claimed indication. however, a significant tightening of this margin would 
 have resulted in an unrealistic increase in the sample size. more importantly, this margin has to be 
 interpreted in the light of the point estimate and taking into account the respective safety profiles of 
 the compared regimens.</p><p>
 the median os time was 10.28 months for both treatment arms. the 1 and 2-year survival rates were 
 43.48% and 18.94%, respectively, for the ac arm and 41.94% and 13.98%, respectively, for the gc 
 arm.</p><p> page 27 of 36 main efficacy results – study jmdb - itt population:</p><p>

 using the cox regression adjusted model for the primary analysis, the primary non-inferiority test was 
 statistically significant (one-sided p&lt;0.001), with the primary cofactor-adjusted survival hr estimated 
 to be 0.94 (95% ci: 0.84 to 1.05), with the entire confidence interval for hr well below the 1.17645 
 non-inferiority margin.</p><p>
 the unadjusted estimate of the survival hr was hr = 0.93; 95% ci: 0.83 to 1.04, with a non-
 inferiority p-value of &lt;0.001.</p><p>thus, study jmdb demonstrated non-inferiority of ac as compared to gc in terms of overall survival 
 when administered as first line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic (stage 
 iiib or iv) nsclc. the result is rather robust and mature. reassuring is, in addition, a trend towards 
 improved os for ac at the end of the kaplan-meier curve. 
 further, the overall result with reference to the primary endpoint is reflected also in the results for the 
 secondary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>
 as study jmdb is a non-inferiority study, efficacy analyses need to be based on the protocol-qualified 
 (pq) population. in study jmdb, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the itt population. 
 sensitivity analyses of main efficacy endpoints were also assessed on the pq population. the efficacy 
 analyses using the pq population follow the same trend as the efficacy analyses for the itt population 
 and support the non-inferiority of ac versus gc.</p><p>
 however, although this non-inferior efficacy has been demonstrated in the overall group of patients 
 with nsclc, pre-planned subgroup analyses showed that a qualitative interaction exists between 
 nsclc histology and treatment effect, with a benefit of ac in patients with adenocarcinoma or large 
 cell carcinoma, and a benefit of gc in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p>

 regarding patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the non-inferiority of ac has not been 
 demonstrated as the upper side of the 95% ci exceeds the non-inferiority margin of 1.17647, 
 page 28 of 36 suggesting that ac is inferior to gc. considering that patients with a squamous cell carcinoma histological subtype represent one third of the patients in both arms (453/1725), the efficacy results 
 preclude an indication of ac in this population.</p><p>
 regarding patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, the non-inferiority of ac was 
 demonstrated, as the upper side of the 95% ci for these populations falls well below the non-
 inferiority margin of 1.17647. the additional sensitivity analyses on os provided by the mah during 
 the procedure also confirm the previously demonstrated non-inferiority of ac vs. gc in patients with 
 adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma histologies. they also provide reassurance that non-
 inferiority is not due to post-discontinuation treatment.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>in the pivotal jmdb study, the safety profile of ac in nsclc was consistent with the known safety profile of ac in mesothelioma.</p><p>in terms of safety, ac can be considered as slightly safer than gc 
 taking into account the better haematotoxicity profile and the slightly worse nephrotoxicity profile of 
 ac vs. gc.</p><p>there were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of alimta 
 plus cisplatin within the histology subgroups.</p><p>
 a total of 3648 cycles of ac were administered to 839 patients in the ac arm, and 3626 cycles of gc 
 were administered to 830 patients in the gc arm. a median of 5 cycles of therapy was administered to 
 patients in both arms.</p><p>
 dose adjustments (delays, reductions, and omissions) were less frequent in patients treated with ac 
 compared to patients treated with gc.</p><p>
 the total number of dose delays (any reason) reported was 815 in the ac arm, and 929 in the gc arm. 
 scheduling conflict was the most commonly reported reason for dose delays in both treatment arms 
 (486 in the ac arm and 514 in the gc arm). in both treatment arms, the most commonly reported 
 adverse events resulting in dose delays were neutropenia (138 in the ac arm and 188 in the gc arm) 
 and anaemia (25 in the ac arm and 43 in the gc arm). 
 in the ac arm, the most common reasons for dose reductions were neutropenia (17 for pemetrexed 
 and 17 for cisplatin), fatigue (6 for pemetrexed and 8 for cisplatin), nausea (5 for pemetrexed and 8 for 
 cisplatin), and febrile neutropenia (5 for pemetrexed and 5 for cisplatin). 
 in the gc arm, the most common reasons for dose reductions were neutropenia (184 for gemcitabine 
 and 59 for cisplatin), thrombocytopenia (82 for gemcitabine and 37 for cisplatin), and febrile 
 neutropenia (15 for gemcitabine and 12 for cisplatin). dose omissions were permitted per protocol 
 only for day 8 gemcitabine.</p><p> page 29 of 36</p></section><section><header>treatment emergent adverse events (teaes)</header><p>the percentage of patients experiencing any possibly study-drug related teaes (reported in ≥10% of all randomized and treated patients) was similar in both treatment arms: 751 patients (89.5%) in the 
 ac arm and 755 patients (91.0%) in the gc arm. in both treatment arms, the most commonly reported 
 possibly study-drug related teaes were anaemia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. the gc 
 arm had more categories of teaes that were statistically higher as compared to the ac arm. patients 
 in the gc arm experienced statistically significantly more anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
 fatigue, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, alopecia, hypokalaemia, neuropathy, peripheral sensory 
 neuropathy, tinnitus, and epistaxis than patients on the ac arm.</p><p>
 eye disorders as a whole (mostly conjunctivitis and increased lacrimation), acute renal failure, dry 
 skin, and pigmentation disorder occurred in significantly more patients on the ac arm.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events (saes)</header><p>139 patients in the ac arm (16.6%) and 136 patients in the gc arm (16.4%) experienced possibly related saes. possibly study-drug related serious febrile neutropenia and pyrexia occurred statistically 
 significantly more often in the gc arm, whereas anorexia and acute renal failure occurred statistically 
 more often in the ac arm. 12 patients in the ac arm and 6 patients in the gc arm had a possibly 
 study-drug related renal-failure sae. 
 in the ac arm, 11/12 cases presented evidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and/or dehydration prior to 
 developing renal failure, and 6/12 cases presented pre-existing conditions and historical illnesses 
 associated with renal impairment.</p><p>
 the nature and severity of the acute renal failure seen in the ac arm of this study is consistent with 
 the known safety profile of the combination as described in the current product information. renal 
 failure was primarily pre-renal in nature due to dehydration induced by gastrointestinal toxicity or 
 sepsis.</p><p>
 note: table jmdb.12.14 summarizes the possibly study-drug related saes that were experienced by 
 &gt;=2% of patients or were statistically significantly different between study arms or were otherwise 
 clinically significant.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation</header><p>15 patients (1.8%) in the ac arm and 23 patients (2.8%) in the gc arm discontinued study treatment due to saes that were considered to be possibly related to the study drug. except for cerebrovascular 
 page 30 of 36 accident (ac: 0.1%, gc: 0.8%; p=0.038), there were no significant differences in the numbers of patients who discontinued study drug, regardless of causality, between treatment arms. 
 57 patients (6.8%) in the ac arm and 60 patients (7.2%) in the gc arm discontinued due to non 
 serious, clinically significant adverse events considered to be possibly related to the study drug. 
 among the discontinuations possibly related to the study drug, increased blood creatinine caused 
 significantly more discontinuations in the ac arm than in the gc arm (p=0.004). haematologic 
 toxicity (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia) caused more discontinuations in the gc arm 
 than in the ac arm.</p></section><section><header>grade 3/4 toxicities</header><p>patients in the gc arm experienced statistically significantly more grade 3 and 4 laboratory toxicities than patients in the ac arm (39.9% versus 22.6%, p&lt;0.001). in both treatment arms, the most 
 frequently reported grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia, which was reported in statistically 
 significantly more patients in the gc arm than in the ac arm (26.7% versus 15.1%, p&lt;0.001). other 
 grade 3/4 toxicities experienced by significantly more patients in the gc arm than in the ac arm were 
 also haematologic and included anaemia (9.9% versus 5.6%, p&lt;0.001), leucopenia (7.6% versus 4.8%, 
 p&lt;0.001), and thrombocytopenia (12.7% versus 4.1%, p&lt;0.001). 
 when ctc grades 1 through 4 are considered, the incidence of elevated creatinine is statistically 
 significantly higher in the ac arm than in the gc arm (10.1% versus 6.9%, p=0.018).</p><p>overall, patients in the gc arm experienced similar grade 3 and 4 non-laboratory toxicities as patients 
 in the ac arm (23.5% versus 21.5%, p=0.320).</p><p>
 patients in the ac arm experienced statistically significantly more study-drug related grade 3/4 
 anorexia (2.4% versus 0.7%, p=0.009) and nausea (7.2% versus 3.9%, p=0.004).</p><p>
 possibly study-drug related grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in statistically significantly more 
 patients in the gc arm than in the ac arm (3.7% versus 1.3%, p=0.002).</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>a total of 116 on-therapy deaths were reported: 63 deaths in the ac arm and 53 deaths in the gc arm. these events are categorized as due to study disease, possibly related to study-drug toxicity, and due 
 to other causes. for any category, the difference in the number of deaths was not statistically 
 significant between study arms.</p><p>
 in the ac arm, 9 on-therapy deaths were considered by the investigator to be possibly due to study-
 drug toxicity, whereas in the gc arm, 6 on-therapy deaths were considered by the investigator to be 
 possibly due to study-drug toxicity.</p><p>
 there were 61 cases of deaths due to other causes, 31 on the ac arm and 30 on the gc arm. overall, 
 the most commonly reported reasons for deaths due to other causes were pulmonary events and 
 cardiac events. 
 a total of 27 deaths were reported within 30 days of last study drug dose: 13 deaths in the ac arm and 
 14 deaths in the gc arm.</p><p>
 a review undertaken by the mah of patient summaries found possibly study-drug related causes for

 the gc arm presented a statistically higher hematological toxicity as compared to the ac arm 
 responsible for discontinuation and grade 3/4 toxicities. 
 on the other hand, renal toxicity was numerically higher in the ac arm compared to gc arm. 
 despite the overall higher toxicity in the gc arm than in the ac arm, the death cases in the ac arm 
 are of great interest, reflecting the known safety profile of the pemetrexed/cisplatin regimen: more 
 deaths due to infection (2 septic shock, 1 sepsis and 1 neutropenia) in the ac arm as compared to gc 
 page 33 of 36 arm (1 septicemia); death due to gastro-intestinal toxicity (sigmoides perforation and bleeding gastric); death related to renal toxicity (renal failure and elevated creatinine and urea levels).</p><p>
 further, although reported as unrelated to the study drug, the 14 death cases classified as pulmonary 
 causes are of great interest, although these were similar in number to the 9 death cases classified as 
 pulmonary causes reported on the gc arm. there were no statistically significant differences between 
 the ac and gc arms in terms of number of deaths reported for study disease, drug toxicity, or “other 
 causes.”

 accounts for the vast majority of lung cancers (80%). surgery is the preferred treatment of patients 
 with early disease. however, more than 60-65% of patients present with a locally advanced (stage 
 iiib) or metastatic disease (stage iv) and are not suitable for surgery. 
 the current standard of first-line treatment in patients with advanced disease consists of platinum-
 based doublet regimens (combination of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, doectaxel, or paclitaxel with 
 cisplatin or carboplatin) where 1-year survival rates of 33% and 2-year survival rates of 11% have 
 been reported.</p><p>
 this application for a type ii variation to extend the indication of alimta to include first line treatment 
 of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsclc is supported by a well-managed and well-
 analysed pivotal non-inferiority phase iii trial, jmdb.</p><p>
 study jmdb demonstrated non-inferiority of ac as compared to gc in terms of overall survival when 
 administered as first line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic (stage iiib or 
 iv) nsclc. the result is rather robust and mature. in addition, a trend towards improved os for ac 
 at the end of the kaplan-meier curve is reassuring. 
 the overall result with reference to the primary endpoint is reflected also in the results for the 
 secondary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>
 in study jmdb, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the itt population. sensitivity analyses of 
 main efficacy endpoints were also assessed on the protocol-qualified (pq) population. the efficacy 
 analyses using the pq population follow the same trend as the efficacy analyses in the itt population 
 and support the non-inferiority of ac versus gc.</p><p>
 page 34 of 36 in terms of safety, ac can be considered as slightly safer than gc taking into account the better haematotoxicity profile (statistically significantly different) and the slightly worse nephrotoxicity 
 profile of ac vs. gc.</p><p>
 as the comparator gc is a widely accepted standard treatment in advanced nsclc, it could have 
 been concluded that the benefit/risk assessment of ac in the overall population of nsclc patients is 
 positive. however, the sub-group analyses of the treatment effect by histology revealed a strong 
 signal.</p><p> 
 retrospective sub-group analyses of two preceding trials investigating pemetrexed as monotherapy in 
 second line treatment of nsclc (studies jmei and ns01, the first part of the original maa and the 
 second a randomised, dose-optimising trial discussed above) indicated lower efficacy of alimta in the 
 histological sub-group squamous cell carcinoma. furthermore, the prospectively planned sub-group 
 analysis by histology of trial jmdb confirmed lower efficacy also in the context of the combination 
 treatment. similarly, analyses in studies jmei and ns01 indicated higher efficacy of alimta in 
 patients with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology, and the prospectively 
 planned subgroup analysis in jmdb confirmed higher efficacy for ac in this population .</p><p>
 therefore, the chmp concluded that the benefit/risk ratio of ac in squamous cell nsclc is clearly 
 negative since</p><p>gc offered prolonged survival compared to ac. however, the benefit/risk ratio in the 
 remainder nsclc population without predominantly squamous cell histology, i.e. in patients with 
 adenocarcinoma or large cell nsclc, is clearly positive, where ac offers prolonged survival 
 compared to gc.</p><p>in view of the outcome of the chmp’s benefit/risk assessment, the mah proposed during the 
 procedure to limit the current second line monotherapy indication accordingly and the following final 
 wording of the nsclc indication in section 4.1 of the spc was agreed:</p></section><section><header>“non-small cell lung cancer  
 alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with 
 locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
 cell histology (see section 5.1).
  
  
 alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally 
 advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
 histology (see section 5.1).”</header><p>section 5.1 of the spc has been updated to reflect the results of the pivotal study jmdb in first line nsclc. in addition, the information regarding second line nsclc has been updated and a statement 
 added to reflect the results of study jmgx investigating the efficacy of pemetrexed after first line 
 treatment with docetaxel.</p><p>
 as the posology of the newly studied combination treatment in first line nsclc is the same as the 
 posology already granted for the treatment of mesothelioma, and in view of the experience gained in 
 study jmdb and the post-marketing setting with alimta, the mah proposes to provide in section 4.2 
 of the spc a single dosage recommendation for the use of alimta in combination with cisplatin as 
 well as a single table for dose modifications applicable to both monotherapy and combination 
 treatment.</p><p>
 in addition, common toxicity criteria have been clarified in section 4.2 and section 4.8 of the spc 
 and section 4 of the package leaflet for all indications.</p><p>
 all the proposed consequential changes to</p><p>sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the spc and the package 
 leaflet can be agreed.</p><p>
 page 35 of 36 page 36 of 36 in addition, the mah took the opportunity to include a minor clarification in section 4.5 regarding concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and to make minor editorial</p><p>changes to the spc and 
 package leaflet and these changes are acceptable.</p><p>
 during the procedure, the mah also submitted the results of user testing of the package leaflet and 
 these results were reviewed by the committee and considered acceptable.</p><p>
 with reference to the safety database, all adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-
 marketing have been included in the spc. the chmp did not consider that any change to the current 
 psur cycle was necessary following this extension of indication. however, the severity of toxicities 
 (grade 3 and 4 alt and ast elevations, thrombocytopenia, and rash) which were higher in the 
 pemetrexed arm (in study jmei) will be closely monitored and reported within future psurs.</p><p>
 a risk management plan was submitted. the chmp, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
 opinion that:</p><p>
 � routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.</p><p>
 � no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.</p><p>the mah has updated annex iib to reflect the latest pharmacovigilance system (version 2.0) and risk 
 management plan (version 1.2) approved by the chmp, which is acceptable.</p></section><section><header>iv. conclusion</header><p>on 21 february 2008 the chmp considered this type ii variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics, annex ii and package 
 leaflet.</p></section></body></xml>
