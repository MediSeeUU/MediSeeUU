 introduction</header><p>the active substance of alimta is pemetrexed, an antifolate that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting the folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.</p><p>
 in vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (ts), dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
 formyltransferase (garft), which are crucial for the 
 de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed and their prolonged intracellular half-life are 
 resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.</p><p>alimta was granted a marketing authorisation (ma) in the european union (eu) on 20 september 
 2004. alimta is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
 patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. alimta is also indicated in combination 
 with cisplatin for the first line treatment, and as monotherapy for the second line treatment, of patients 
 with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
 cell histology.</p><p>lung cancer</p><p>
 over one million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in close to one million deaths. it is the second most common cancer in men as well as women, accounting for 
 about 13% of cancer diagnoses, but it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in industrialized 
 countries. it is one of the few that continues to show an increasing incidence. prognosis is poor with 
 relative 1-year survival rates of approximately 30% and 5-year survival rates around 10%. 134.171 
 men and 29.948 women died of lung cancer in the european union in 1985. although the standardised 
 mortality ratio is declining slightly in men it is still rising in women in the vast majority of european 
 countries.</p><p>
 lung cancer is subdivided in two groups: small cell lung cancer (sclc) and non small cell lung 
 cancer (nsclc). sclc is recognized by its chemo- and radiosensitivity. nsclc is a heterogenous 
 group of tumours with common treatment and prognosis. 
 nsclc represents about 80% of all lung cancer cases. the most common histologies are epidermoid 
 or squamous cell carcinoma (~40% of cases), adenocarcinoma (~35% of cases), and large cell 
 carcinoma (~25% of cases). the frequency of these different histological subsets varies across 
 countries and over time, with a decrease in squamous cell histology in industrialised countries.</p><p>
 surgery is the preferred treatment of patients with early disease. however, more than 60-65% of 
 patients present with a locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic disease (stage iv) and are not 
 suitable for surgery. current standard of care of patients presenting with locally advanced or 
 metastasising nsclc is systemic chemotherapy with platinum based doublets. typically, these 
 platinum based doublets are administered for 4 to 6 cycles (provided that progression of disease does 
 not occur). for patients with a disease staged as iiib or iv the primary goal of therapy is palliative 
 treatment. only moderate gains in survival and other outcomes like time to disease progression and 
 quality of life have been shown with platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>bevacizumab was approved as first-line therapy for advanced nsclc based on improvement in 
 overall survival (os) when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and improved progression-free 
 survival (pfs) when combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine, as compared to the platinum doublet 
 alone. bevacizumab was administered in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to 6 
 cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression.</p><p>
 a second 3-arm study evaluated 2 doses of bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine and 
 cisplatin for up to 6 cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression. 
 bevacizumab therapy is limited to patients with non-squamous nsclc histology.</p><p>
 page 2 of 40 alimta in combination with cisplatin has also recently been approved for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology. this approval was 
 based on results from study jmdb, a phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin (ac) compared to 
 gemcitabine plus cisplatin (gc). the primary objective of study jmdb was the comparison of os 
 time between patients treated with ac versus gc as first-line treatment for locally advanced or 
 metastatic nsclc. patients were treated for a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy.</p><p>once first line treatment with platinum doublets has been completed, there are currently only second 
 line treatment options available in patients progressing. licensed second line treatments include 
 docetaxel monotherapy, and alimta monotherapy (limited to non-squamous nsclc histologies).</p><p>
 the concept of maintenance treatment in nsclc has been investigated in the past without convincing 
 results. however, maintenance therapy studies of single-agent docetaxel, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine 
 have suggested benefit of single-agent treatment with improved os, time to disease progression (ttp), 
 pfs, or response rate (rr) following first-line (induction) therapy.</p><p>scope of the variation</p><p>
 this type ii variation concerns an extension of indication to include monotherapy maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (nsclc). sections 4.1, 4.8 
 and 5.1 of the spc have been updated and the package leaflet has been updated accordingly.</p><p>
 further, the mah has updated annex iib to include the version number of the latest risk management 
 plan (version 2.1) agreed with the chmp.</p><p>for this new indication, the proposed posology is the one already authorised for alimta as 
 monotherapy in the 2
 nd line treatment of nsclc. in patients treated for nsclc after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of alimta is 500 mg/m2 bsa administered as an intravenous 
 infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</p><p>the new nsclc maintenance treatment indication is supported by</p><p>one pivotal, multicentre, 
 randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (jmen), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of</p><p>
 maintenance treatment with alimta plus best supportive care (bsc) (n=441) with that of placebo plus 
 bsc (n=222) in patients with locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic (stage iv) nsclc who did 
 not progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in 
 combination with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. first line doublet therapy containing 
 alimta was not included because the results of the first-line study with alimta-cisplatin were not 
 yet available.</p></section><section><header>clinical aspects  gcp compliance</header><p>all clinical studies included in the dossier have been conducted in compliance with the principles of good clinical practice (gcp).</p></section><section><header>clinical pharmacology</header><p>no new data concerning clinical pharmacology have been submitted in support of the present application, which is acceptable.</p><p>
 the clinical pharmacology of pemetrexed has been well characterized as part of the initial marketing 
 authorisation application for mpm and for previously treated nsclc. given the extensive 
 information available regarding the clinical pharmacology of pemetrexed, both administered as a 
 single agent and in combination with cisplatin, no further pharmacokinetic information was collected 
 in the phase iii study jmen. clinical pharmacology for the maintenance indication is not expected to 
 be different from other approved indications for pemetrexed (e.g., second-line treatment with single-
 agent pemetrexed).</p><p>
 page 3 of 40</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>as mentioned above, the new requested indication is mainly supported by one pivotal, multicentre, 
 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 3 study (jmen).</p></section><section><header>pivotal clinical phase iii study - jmen  methods</header><p>the primary objective of study jmen was to compare maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus best 
 standard care (bsc) 
 versus placebo plus bsc, in terms of objective pfs in patients with stage iiib (with pleural effusion and/or positive supraclavicular lymph nodes) or stage iv nsclc who had not 
 progressed during 4 cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy.</p><p>secondary objectives of the study were to compare (i) overall survival (os) time, (ii) additional time-
 to-event efficacy endpoints (time to objective progressive disease (ttp), time to worsening of 
 symptoms (tws), (iii) objective tumor response rate, (iv) adverse events and finally (v) changes in 
 individual symptom scores and quality of life using the lung cancer symptom scale (lcss) between 
 the randomized study arms. 
 an additional secondary objective was the consideration of efficacy with respect to histologic types, 
 including an assessment of treatment-by-histology interaction.</p></section><section><header>study design</header><p>study jmen was a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. approximately 660 patients were planned to be enrolled. subjects were randomized (in a 2:1 ratio) to 
 the experimental study arm (pemetrexed plus bsc) or the control arm (placebo plus bsc) following 
 induction therapy. patients were required to be chemo naive prior to induction chemotherapy.</p><p>
 according to the protocol, patients in both study arms were required to receive folic acid and vitamin 
 b12 supplementation and dexamethasone.</p><p>
 a minimization principle was adopted to balance patient assignment between study arms, using a 
 probability factor of 0.75, based on the following factors:</p><p>
  disease stage prior to administration of induction therapy (iiib versus iv)  ecog performance status just prior to randomization (0 versus 1)  best tumor response to induction chemotherapy (cr/pr versus sd)  gender (male versus female)  previously treated brain metastases (yes versus no)  non-platinum component of induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine versus paclitaxel versus docetaxel).</p><p>
 each patient underwent a treatment period and a follow-up period.</p><p>the treatment period consisted of 
 treatment cycles, each 21 days long. patients received treatment (experimental or control) until 
 objective disease progression. the follow-up period began when the patient discontinued study 
 treatment; follow-up included periodic tumor response evaluation until objective disease progression.</p><p>
 investigators followed all patients until death or study closure. maintenance treatment had to begin 
 ≥ 21 and ≤ 42 days from the last dose of induction therapy.</p><p> page 4 of 40</p></section><section><header>figure 1:</header><p> jmen study design</p><p>

 objective pfs was measured from the date of randomization (after completion of induction 
 chemotherapy) to the first date of objective progression of disease or of death from any cause. for 
 each patient who was not known to have died or to have had objective progression of disease as of the 
 data-inclusion cut-off date for the analysis, pfs was censored at the date of the patient’s last tumour 
 assessment prior to that cut-off date.</p><p>
 page 6 of 40 overall survival time (os) is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. for each patient who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for the 
 analysis, os was to be censored at the date of last prior contact.</p><p>
 time to objective progressive disease (tpd) is measured from the date of randomization to the first 
 date of objective progression of disease. for each patient who is not known to have had an objective 
 progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for the analysis, or who has died without 
 objective progressive disease, tpd will be censored for that analysis at the date of the patient’s last 
 tumour assessment prior to that cut-off date. please note that tpd, else than pfs, does not include 
 death as an event.</p><p>time to worsening of symptoms</p><p>(tws) was measured from the date of randomization to the first date 
 of a worsening in any one of the 6 lung cancer symptom scale (lcss) symptoms (as defined by a 
 15-mm increase from baseline in the patient-reported score for any symptom).</p><p>
 tumour response was assessed using recist criteria.</p><p>
 adverse events were rated using the nci ctcae scale.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>the study was designed to randomize approximately 660 patients at a 2:1 ratio between 2 maintenance study arms: (a) pemetrexed 500 mg/m
 2 plus bsc administered until disease progression (approximately 440 patients), or (b) a treatment option utilizing placebo plus bsc until disease 
 progression (approximately 220 patients).</p><p>
 the sponsor originally selected this sample size to provide a final analysis of os with 80% power 
 using a one-sided alpha level of 0.025, assuming 475 events and an os hr of 0.767. the implemented 
 protocol amendment (a) changed the primary endpoint of this trial to pfs while maintaining nearly 
 identical statistical assumptions and error control of the originally planned final analysis of os.</p><p>all study outcomes were analyzed at the time of pfs analysis (after a minimum of 462 pfs events).</p><p>
 according to the protocol, in order to maintain an overall one-sided alpha error probability of 0.025 
 (for the pfs and os analyses), the study applied the following statistical gate keeping and alpha-
 spending scheme: 
 (i) the primary statistical test of pfs was performed using a nominal one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
 (ii) a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 was split between the preliminary and final analyses of os: a 
 nominal one-sided level of 0.00001 was spent for the preliminary analysis of os, leaving a nominal 
 level of 0.02499 to be spent for the final analysis of os.</p><p>
 the primary analysis assumed the pfs hr as approximately constant during the period of follow-up 
 after randomization and estimated the pfs hr from the study data using a cox proportional hazards 
 model with assigned treatment as the only covariate. from this cox model, a two-tailed 95% 
 confidence interval was used to assess the following statistical hypotheses:</p><p>
 • 
 h0:</p><p>pfs hr ≥ 1.00 (null hypothesis) 
 • 
 ha:</p><p>pfs hr &lt; 1.00 (alternative, research hypothesis) 
 if the 95% confidence interval for the pfs hr was found to fall entirely below the margin of 1.00, the 
 null hypothesis h0 would be rejected at a nominal one-sided 0.025 significance level.</p><p>
 assuming the primary analysis included at least 462 pfs events, and assuming the true value of the 
 pfs hr would be 0.75, there was an 85% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis h0.</p><p>
 the final analysis of os would include a minimum of 475 os events (projected to occur 
 approximately 1 year after the primary analysis). a one-sided test of hypotheses was planned to be 
 performed at a nominal 0.02499 level (using hypotheses analogous to those described above for pfs).</p><p>
 assuming the true value of the os hr is 0.767, there is approximately an 80% probability of a 
 page 7 of 40 statistically significant test. therefore, this amended analysis plan was supposed to preserve the original protocol-designed statistical power for assessing os.</p><p>
 covariate-adjusted analyses of time-to-event variables were performed using the cox proportional 
 hazards model stratified by the non-platinum component of the induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine 
 versus taxanes). the following covariates were considered for inclusion in the adjusted models:</p><p>
 -assigned study treatment (pemetrexed plus bsc over placebo plus bsc) 
 -ecog performance status just prior to randomization (0 over 1) 
 -platinum component of induction therapy (cisplatin over carboplatin)

 description of platinum agent in induction regimen:</p><p>all patients were treated with a platinum-based regimen, either with cisplatin 
 (yes) or carboplatin (no).</p><p>progression-free survival measured from start of induction treatment: the primary pfs analysis of 
 the study was measured from the date of randomization, which occurred after completion of induction 
 therapy. an additional analysis of pfs was calculated from the date of the first dose of induction 
 chemotherapy to the first date of objective progression of disease or of death from any cause.</p><p>it was 
 expected that this analysis would add approximately 3 months to the median times observed in the 
 primary analysis.</p><p>evaluating from the start of induction therapy did not change the hr or the p-value 
 compared to the primary analysis. median pfs measured from the start of induction treatment was 
 7.72 months in the pemetrexed arm and 5.91 months in the placebo arm.</p><p>
 independently reviewed progression-free survival: to further evaluate the robustness of pfs, the 
 sponsor established an independent review of pfs to assess the potential for investigator bias in the 
 determination of progressive disease between study arms. of the 663 randomized patients with 
 investigator assessments of pfs, reviewable scans were available for independent review for 581 
 patients (87.6%). independently assessed median pfs following induction therapy was 4.04 months in 
 the pemetrexed arm and 1.97 months in the placebo arm, with the unadjusted hr estimated to be 0.60 
 (95% ci:</p><p>0.49 to 0.73). this analysis demonstrated that results of investigator-assessed pfs were 
 consistent with those of the independently reviewed assessments in terms of the relative efficacy of the 
 2 arms.</p></section><section><header>sensitivity analyses</header><p>sensitivity analyses of pfs were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis with respect to the definition of censoring and the timing of radiologic assessments. the first sensitivity 
 analysis (sa1) defined pfs as in the primary analysis, but with additional censoring at the date a 
 patient initiated postdiscontinuation anticancer therapy.</p><p>a total of 13 additional patients were 
 censored compared to the primary analysis.</p><p>the results of sa1 are nearly identical to results from the 
 primary pfs analysis.</p><p>
 the other 2 sensitivity analyses (sa2 and sa3) adjusted the definition of pfs dependent on the timing 
 of the first radiologic assessment with pd. according to the study schedule, radiologic assessments 
 were conducted after every 2 cycles of therapy (approximately every 42 days).</p><p>compared to the 
 page 12 of 40 placebo arm, a greater number of patients in the pemetrexed arm experienced dose delays which may have led to delayed radiologic assessments. thus, sa2 and sa3 were conducted to assess whether 
 there was any bias affecting the analysis caused by delayed assessments in the pemetrexed arm.</p><p>
 for patients who had pd occurring more than 49 days after the previous radiologic assessment, sa2 
 moved the date of the pd back to the date when the radiologic assessment would have occurred if 
 there had been no delay (that is, 42 days after the previous assessment).</p><p>while median pfs times 
 under this definition were slightly shorter on both arms compared to those under the primary analysis, 
 the estimated hazard ratio was very similar to the primary analysis.</p><p>
 for those patients who had pd occurring more than 49 days after the previous radiologic assessment, 
 sa3 censored the pfs times of these patients back to the date of the earlier assessment.</p><p>the results 
 are very similar to the findings in the primary analysis. 
 these sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the primary analysis; they strongly indicate that 
 postdiscontinuation therapy and delayed radiologic assessments did not bias the primary analysis in 
 favor of pemetrexed.</p></section><section><header>table 7:</header><p> progression-free survival, sensitivity analyses</p></section><section><header>median pfs (95% ci)

 treatment benefit in certain subgroups. subgroups were analyzed separately as defined by the 
 following factors: nsclc histology, age, gender, origin, smoking status, ecog performance status, 
 induction platinum, and induction response. several of these factors are commonly found to be 
 prognostic of os in advanced nsclc.</p><p>
 additional rationale for certain subgroup analyses are described further below: 
 - the choice of ever-smoker versus never-smoker is based on erlotinib data showing that erlotinib was 
 more</p><p>effective in patients who had never been smokers than in current or former smokers. in addition, 
 smoking status may be associated with histologic cell type and other patient comorbidities, which may 
 impact patient prognosis.</p><p>in study jmdb, smoking status was identified as a significant prognostic 
 factor for first-line nsclc patients. 
 - safety and efficacy analyses by age and origin (as well as gender, included as a randomization 
 factor) are regulatory requirements; the categories for origin were divided into 3 groups based on a 
 blinded review of study jmen baseline data, permitting adequately sized categories for meaningful 
 comparisons. 
 page 13 of 40 - histologic categories of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are the most common nsclc cell types. the prospective decision to perform histologic subgroup analyses in 
 study jmen was based on results of the pivotal phase 3 study jmdb, and on a retrospective analysis 
 of the phase 3 study of pemetrexed in previously treated nsclc (study jmei), which suggested a 
 possible correlation between histology and efficacy.</p><p>
 the subgroup analyses showed that pfs was significantly superior in the pemetrexed arm for the 
 subcategories of age (&lt; 65, 
  65) and gender.</p><p>the majority of patients were either caucasian or east asian (87.8% of patients); the pfs for these patients was similar to the overall population, with a 
 significant increase in pfs in the pemetrexed arm.</p></section><section><header>table 8:</header><p>summary of progression-free survival by age, gender, and origin</p></section><section><header>median pfs (months) subgroups

 interactions indicated that for patients treated with pemetrexed, those with non-squamous histology 
 (adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and other or unknown histology) tend to have better survival

 prespecified tests for histology-by-treatment interaction were performed using cox models that 
 included cofactors potentially prognostic for pfs and os.</p><p>based on the results of cofactor-adjusted 
 analyses, most cofactors did not appear to be prognostic for either pfs or os. tests for interaction 
 were stratified by the non-platinum component of induction therapy (gemcitabine versus 
 paclitaxel/docetaxel) and included terms for treatment (pemetrexed versus placebo), squamous 
 histology (no 
 versus yes), treatment-by-squamous interaction (nonsquamous pemetrexed versus all other patients), ecog performances status (0 
 versus 1), induction response (cr/pr versus sd), east asian ethnicity (yes 
 versus no), smoking status (never versus ever), gender (female versus male), and age (&lt; 65 
 versus ≥ 65).</p><p>the platinum component of induction therapy and the stage of disease were the only factors omitted because they showed no tendency toward any prognostic effect.</p><p>
 the results showed statistically significant interactions for pfs (interaction hr = 0.65; p = 0.036) and 
 for os (interaction hr = 0.66; p = 0.041). these tests confirmed the results seen in previous phase 3 
 studies (study jmei and study jmdb), showing that patients with non-squamous histology in the

 treatment with alimta plus best supportive care (bsc) (n = 441) with that of placebo plus bsc (n= 
 222) in patients with locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic (stage iv) nsclc who did not 
 progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in combination 
 with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. first line doublet therapy containing alimta was not 
 included because the results of the first-line study with alimta-cisplatin were not yet available.</p><p>
 all patients included in this study had an ecog performance status of 0 or 1. patients received 
 maintenance treatment until disease progression. efficacy and safety were measured from the time of 
 randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. patients received a median of 5 cycles 
 of maintenance treatment with alimta and 3.5 cycles of placebo. a total of 213 patients (48.3%) 
 completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 patients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with 
 alimta.</p><p> 
 the study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in pfs in the 
 alimta arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of 4.0 months 
 and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% ci: 0.49-0.73, p &lt; 0.00001). the independent 
 review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of pfs.</p><p>the median os 
 for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the alimta arm and 10.6 months for the 
 placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% ci:</p><p>0.65 to 0.95; p = 0.01192).</p><p>
 page 25 of 40 consistent with other alimta studies, a difference in efficacy according to nsclc histology was observed in jmen. for patients with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n= 
 430, independently reviewed population) median pfs was 4.4 months for the alimta arm and 1.8 
 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% ci: 0.37-0.60, p= 0.00001. the median os for 
 patients with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 months 
 for the alimta arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% ci:</p><p>0.56-0.88, 
 p=0.002).</p><p>including the induction phase the median os for patients with nsclc other than 
 predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the alimta arm and 13.6 months for the 
 placebo arm (hazard ratio =0.71, 95% ci: 0.56-0.88, p=0.002). 
 the pfs and os results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for alimta 
 over placebo.</p><p>

 the pemetrexed arm and 222 to the placebo arm. of the 441 patients randomized to the pemetrexed 
 arm, 432 received at least 1 cycle of treatment. of the 222 patients randomized to the placebo arm, 
 221 received at least 1 cycle of treatment.</p><p>
 in accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan, all safety variables were evaluated at the 
 time of the primary analysis for progression-free survival (pfs). a second safety analysis was 
 performed approximately 6 months after the primary safety analysis. the purpose of the updated 
 analysis was to assess event rates and determine if there were any new safety signals from patients 
 with additional follow-up.</p><p>
 at the time of the second safety analysis, patients in the pemetrexed arm received a median of 5 
 cycles, whereas patients in the placebo arm received a median of 3.5 cycles.</p><p>
 the percentage of patients exposed to pemetrexed for at least 6 cycles was 48.3%, which is 
 significantly greater than those in the placebo-treated group (27.5%) (p&lt;0.0001). 
 ninety-eight (22.2%) patients in the pemetrexed arm and 19 (8.6%) patients in the placebo arm 
 completed at least 10 cycles (p &lt; 0.001) at the time of the updated safety analysis.</p><p>

 3/4 nonlaboratory toxicity, neutropenia, and fatigue, compared to men receiving placebo. no other 
 statistically significant differences were observed between study arms for either male or female 
 patients.</p><p>
 - no statistically significant differences were observed between male and female patients treated with 
 pemetrexed.</p><p>
 - for patients of caucasian origin, the only significant differences were observed in the incidence of 
 grade 3/4 toxicities of neutrophils/granulocytes decreased (p = 0.017) and fatigue (p = 0.001), with 
 significantly more patients in the pemetrexed arm than in the placebo arm reporting these toxicities.</p><p>
 - statistically significantly more pemetrexed-treated patients of caucasian origin reported grade 3/4 
 fatigue than those in the other subgroup: 6.45% versus 0.62%; p = 0.003. no other statistically 
 significant differences were observed.</p><p>
 page 34 of 40 - analyses of safety for histological subgroups were generally consistent with the safety profiles for pemetrexed and placebo observed in the entire patient population. no clinically significant safety 
 trends were identified that would suggest that 1 subgroup experienced a different toxicity profile of 
 pemetrexed compared to other subgroups, or to the randomized or treated population as a whole.</p></section><section><header>effect on long-term exposure on patient safety</header><p>the safety profile of pemetrexed has been well characterized in previous studies for patient exposures up to a median of 6 cycles. 
 with regard to long-term maintenance therapy, 29.5% of patients in the pemetrexed arm completed 
 more than 6 cycles. additional analysis of possibly drug-related grade 3 and grade 4 ctcae 
 toxicities comparing patients receiving ≤ 6 cycles and patients receiving &gt; 6 cycles of pemetrexed did 
 not show any statistical difference between these groups. in addition, no statistically significant 
 differences were seen in any individual categories of laboratory or non-laboratory toxicities between 
 the 2 groups.</p></section><section><header>key supportive studies</header><p>study jmei is included as a key supportive study because it is a single-agent study in patients with nsclc after prior chemotherapy treatment. study jmei was the pivotal study for approval of 
 pemetrexed as a second-line, single-agent therapy for nsclc.</p><p>the study used the same dosage of 
 pemetrexed as in study jmen, and patients received the same vitamin supplementation regimen.</p><p> 
 the eligibility criteria were similar between the studies, with notable exceptions.</p><p>study jmen 
 excluded patients with a best response of progressive disease (pd) to induction (first-line) 
 chemotherapy.</p><p>in contrast, study jmei included patients who had failed prior chemotherapy.</p><p>while 
 study jmen only enrolled patients with an eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) 
 performance status of 0 or 1, study jmei also included patients with an ecog performance status of 
 2. these differences may help explain some variations in safety observed between the 2 studies.</p><p>
 in addition to the differences between the patient populations in studies jmen and jmei, laboratory 
 assessments for potential toxicity were also different.</p><p>in study jmei, haematology laboratory 
 assessments were performed on day 1 (prior to therapy), day 8, and day 15, and serum chemistries 
 were performed on day 1 (prior to therapy) and day 8 of each 21-day cycle.</p><p>the jmen protocol 
 required that haematology and serum chemistry assessments be performed only once during each 21-
 day cycle, prior to study drug administration.</p><p>as a result, the incidence and severity of laboratory 
 toxicity in study jmen could be lower than that observed in study jmei, in part due to less frequent 
 assessments in study jmen.</p><p>the percentage of patients completing at least 6 cycles of pemetrexed was higher in study jmen 
 (48.3%) than in study jmei (34.0%), which may in part be explained by differences between the 
 study populations. further, the overall incidence of grade ¾ toxicities was lower in study jmen than 
 in study jmei.</p><p>page 35 of 40</p></section><section><header>table 29:</header><p>overview of adverse events - studies jmen and jmei</p></section><section><header>number of patients (%) with adverse event

 incidence observed in the pemetrexed arm of study jmei and is likely to be reflective of the 
 differences between the 2 studies patient populations and study designs.</p><p>
 in the pivotal study jmen, out of the 65 reported deaths (9.8% in the pemetrexed arm and 9.9% in the 
 placebo arm), 2.7% occurred while on study therapy or less than 30 days after last dose in the 
 pemetrexed arm 
 versus 4.5% in the placebo arm.</p><p>no study drug-related deaths were reported for either study arm.</p><p>however, according to the provided narratives, data for causality assessment are 
 page 37 of 40 missing in some cases and a causal relationship between adverse events leading to death and study drug can therefore not be definitely excluded in some cases.</p><p>
 overall, more patients treated with pemetrexed than patients treated with placebo had dose 
 adjustments (4.8% in the pemetrexed arm/ 0.9% in the placebo arm). all pemetrexed dose adjustments 
 were a result of adverse events. the incidence of drug-related toxicities was statistically higher in the 
 pemetrexed arm compared to the placebo arm. neutropenia and fatigue were statistically significantly 
 different between the 2 treatment arms.</p><p>
 the most common toxicities were of haematologic origin, gastro-intestinal disorders (nausea, 
 vomiting, stomatitis), increased asat and alat and neuropathy. renal toxicity was more common 
 in the pemetrexed arm; 33 patients in the pemetrexed arm (7.5%) were reported to have a possibly 
 drug-related adverse event associated with decreased renal function.</p><p>
 the most frequently reported sae was anaemia, which occurred in 1.4% of patients in the pemetrexed 
 arm; all other saes occurred in less than 1% of patients. no serious, unexpected, reportable events 
 (surs) were reported.</p><p>
 with regard to long-term maintenance therapy, there were no statistically or clinically relevant 
 differences in the safety profile reported for patients receiving more than 6 cycles of pemetrexed 
 compared to those receiving 6 cycles or less. however, given the small number of patients remaining 
 on treatment after 6 cycles, no conclusion can be drawn.</p><p>
 overall, the safety results for pemetrexed as a maintenance treatment were consistent with the known 
 safety profile of pemetrexed. all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
 have been included in the spc. the chmp does not consider that any change to the psur cycle is 
 necessary following this extension of indication.</p><p>pharmacovigilance</p><p>an updated risk management plan was submitted. the chmp, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:</p><p>
  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.</p><p>
  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk assessment</header><p>efficacy</p><p>the new nsclc maintenance treatment indication is supported by a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (jmen), that compared the efficacy and safety of maintenance 
 treatment with alimta plus best supportive care (bsc) (n = 441) with that of placebo plus bsc (n= 
 222) in patients with locally advanced (stage iiib) or metastatic (stage iv) nsclc who did not 
 progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in combination 
 with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. first line doublet therapy containing alimta was not 
 included because the results of the first-line study with alimta-cisplatin were not yet available.</p><p>
 all patients included in this study had an ecog performance status of 0 or 1. patients received 
 maintenance treatment until disease progression. efficacy and safety were measured from the time of 
 randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. patients received a median of 5 cycles 
 of maintenance treatment with alimta and 3.5 cycles of placebo. a total of 213 patients (48.3%) 
 completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 patients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with 
 alimta.</p><p> 
 page 38 of 40 the study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in pfs in the alimta arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of 4.0 months 
 and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% ci: 0.49-0.73, p &lt; 0.00001). the independent 
 review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of pfs.</p><p>the median os 
 for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the alimta arm and 10.6 months for the 
 placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% ci:</p><p>0.65 to 0.95; p = 0.01192). all time-to-event parameters 
 were measured from the date of randomization upon completion of induction therapy.</p><p>
 consistent with other alimta studies, a difference in efficacy according to nsclc histology was 
 observed in jmen. for patients with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n= 
 430, independently reviewed population) median pfs was 4.4 months for the alimta arm and 1.8 
 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% ci: 0.37-0.60, p= 0.00001. the median os for 
 patients with nsclc other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 months 
 for the alimta arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% ci:</p><p>0.56-0.88, 
 p=0.002).</p><p>including the induction phase the median os for patients with nsclc other than 
 predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the alimta arm and 13.6 months for the 
 placebo arm (hazard ratio =0.71, 95% ci: 0.56-0.88, p=0.002). 
 the pfs and os results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for alimta 
 over placebo.</p><p>
