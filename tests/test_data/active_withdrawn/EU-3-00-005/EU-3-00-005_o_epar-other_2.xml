 (aml) who may benefit from treatment and have no access to other comparable/alternative 
 therapy’.</p><p>
 this was a marketing authorisation holder (mah)-sponsored study of an authorised medicinal product 
 where 105 (31.7%) patients who were enrolled were &lt;18 years of age. 
 mylotarg received marketing approval in the united states on 01 september 2017 and has a us 
 indication for the treatment of newly-diagnosed cd33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults, and 
 relapsed or refractory cd33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults and in paediatric patients 2 
 years and older. on 19 april 2018, mylotarg received marketing authorization in the european union 
 (eu) for use in combination with daunorubicin (dnr) and cytarabine (arac) for the treatment of 
 patients aged 15 years and older with previously untreated, de novo cd33-positive aml, except acute 
 promyelocytic leukaemia (apl).</p><p>
 a paediatric investigation plan (pip) has been agreed for mylotarg with the european medicines 
 agency (ema)/paediatric committee (pdco) (pip emea-001733-pip02-15-m01).</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.  
 information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study</header><p>mylotarg is an antibody-drug conjugate (adc) composed of the cd33-directed monoclonal antibody (mab; hp67.6; recombinant humanized immunoglobulin g4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian 
 cell culture in non-secreting null [ns0] cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent n-acetyl 
 (nac) gamma calicheamicin.</p><p>
 the antibody portion binds specifically to the cd33 antigen, a sialic acid 
 dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid leukaemic blasts and immature normal 
 cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells.</p><p>
 binding of the anti-cd33 
 antibody portion of mylotarg to the cd33 antigen results in the formation of a complex, which is 
 then internalized. upon internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is released inside the lysosomes of 
 the myeloid cell. the released calicheamicin derivative binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) in the 
 minor groove resulting in dna double-strand breaks and cell death. after administration of hu-m195, 
 another cd33-directed antibody, continuous renewed expression of cd33 antigens on the cell surface 
 was observed, as measured by the cell mean peak fluorescence.</p><p>mylotarg is available in the form of 
 powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (1 mg/ml)

 description 
 methods</header></section><section><header>objective(s)</header><p>the primary objective of the study was to provide expanded access in accordance with fda regulations to allow compassionate access to mylotarg for treatment of patients with cd33 positive acute 
 myeloid leukaemia (aml) (including apl and myelodysplastic syndrome with rising or persistent blasts) 
 who were thought to have the potential to derive clinical benefit and who had exhausted other 
 appropriate and reasonable treatment options including investigational studies. no formal objectives 
 were evaluated.</p><p>
 this paper describes the safety results from this us only study.</p></section><section><header>study design</header><p>this was an open-label (us only) expanded access protocol to treat patients with relapsed or refractory aml including myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) or relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic 
 leukaemia (apl). the protocol allowed the investigator to choose for each patient enrolled an optimal 
 treatment plan, choosing from several mylotarg-containing regimens. the protocol allowed for 
 treatment regimens tested in clinical trial settings and reported in peer reviewed journals. data 
 indicated that these treatment regimens could potentially benefit a patient with relapsed/refractory 
 aml, mds, or apl. 
 the protocol allowed to use of mylotarg as a single agent at ≤9 mg/m
 2/dose for aml or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (atra) and/or arsenic trioxide for treatment of apl. other 
 doses included the use of mylotarg up to 3 mg/m
 2/dose in combination with anthracycline, nucleoside-antagonist containing treatment regimens, or hypomethylating agents. the protocol was to 
 remain open to provide compassionate access to mylotarg for patients within the us until the clinical 
 development of the drug was discontinued, or when mylotarg was commercially available within the 
 us, whichever occurred first.</p></section><section><header>study population /sample size</header><p>patients were eligible for enrolment into the study only if they met all the inclusion criteria outlined in the protocol.</p><p> assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 safety profile of mylotarg and complications of underlying disease. in the monotherapy group, the

 the mah states that study b1761026 met its primary objective of providing access to mylotarg for 
 the treatment of paediatric and adult patients with relapsed or refractory cd33-positive aml (including 
 apl) or mds who were good candidates to potentially derive clinical benefit from a cd33-directed 
 therapy, and who had exhausted other appropriate and reasonable treatment options. an assessment 
 of benefit could not be made, as efficacy and post-mylotarg hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
 outcomes were not collected as a part of this expanded access study. the safety risks of mylotarg 
 treatment, used in a broad range of doses and combination regimens were acceptable for this patient 
 population with serious, life-threatening disease. safety risks were generally consistent between the 
 paediatric population and the entire safety population (adult and paediatric patients). no new safety 
 signals were observed, and the aes of mylotarg were consistent with its known safety profile. 
 the smpc states with respect to the paediatric population specifically:</p></section><section><header n="4">4. 2 posology paediatric population</header><p>the safety and efficacy of mylotarg in patients less than 15 years of age has not been established. currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
 posology can be made.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. 8 undesirable effects: paediatric population</header><p>the safety and efficacy of mylotarg in children and adolescents below the age of 15 years has not been established (see section 4.2). 
 in the completed randomised paediatric phase 3 study aaml0531 (see section 5.1) of gemtuzumab 
 ozogamicin combined with intensive first-line therapy in newly diagnosed children, and young adults 
 with de novo aml aged 0 to 29 years, the safety profile was similar with that observed in the other 
 studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with intensive chemotherapy in adult patients with de 
 novo aml. however, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was not 
 established, since in study aaml0531 during the second intensification period, a larger proportion of 
 patients in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin arm experienced prolonged neutrophil recovery time (&gt; 59 
 days) as compared with the comparator arm (12.0% versus 6.3%), and more patients died during 
 remission (4.2% versus 2.4%).</p></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1 pharmodynamic properties</header><p>in a randomised study (cog aaml0531) that evaluated standard chemotherapy alone or combined with mylotarg in 1,022 newly diagnosed children (94.3% of patients &lt; 18 years of age), and young 
 adults (5.7% of patients); median age was 9.7 years (range: 0.003-29.8 years), patients with de novo 
 aml were randomly assigned to either standard 5-course chemotherapy alone or to the same 
 chemotherapy with 2 doses of mylotarg (3 mg/m
 2/dose) administered once in induction course 1 and once in intensification course 2. the study demonstrated that addition of mylotarg to intensive 
 chemotherapy improved efs (3 years: 53.1% versus 46.9%; hr 0.83; 95% ci: 0.70, 0.99; p=0.04) 
 in de novo aml owing to a reduced relapse risk, with a trend towards longer os in the mylotarg arm 
 which was not statistically significant (3 years: 69.4% versus 65.4%; hr 0.91; 95% ci: 0.74, 1.13; 
 p=0.39). however, it was also found that increased toxicity (post-remission toxic mortality) was 
 observed in patients with low-risk aml which was attributed to the prolonged neutropenia that 
 occurred after receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin during intensification course 2 (see sections 4.2 and 
 4.8). thus, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was not established 
 (see section 4.2).</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 an expanded access study on compassionate grounds and therefore cannot be expected to fulfil the 
 criteria of benefit: risk clinical trials and the data can only be contextualised within those boundaries in 
 a descriptive manner. this study is not mentioned within the smpc for mylotarg.</p><p>the majority of 
 information detailed in smpc is from an adult study (alfa-0701) and post marketing measures. one 
 phase 3 study (study aaml0531) including paediatric subjects is detailed in smpc (as above). this 
 product is licenced only in patients older than 15 years. within the smpc it is stated regarding the 
 paediatric population that ‘the</p><p>safety profile was similar with that observed in the other studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with intensive chemotherapy in adult patients with de novo aml’. 
 overall the following comments are made:</p></section><section><header>study design:</header><p>the enrolment and re-enrolment is not clear in terms of how these patients were treated with respect to treatment assignation. both treatments and study population are very 
 heterogenous with 3 broad treatment arms, with variable dosing of mylotarg, different drugs 
 regimes used in populations with differing pathologies.</p><p>there were deviations from protocol detailed 
 within abbreviated case study report (acsr).</p><p>safety evaluations are limited as only grade 3-5 events were captured for all patients receiving at least 
 1 dose of mylotarg. laboratory parameters themselves were not recorded and only captured as part 
 of a grade 3-5 ae.</p></section><section><header>safety data</header><p>although the mah states that some of the treatment related effects were thought by investigator to be attributable to mylotarg, this would have been challenging to determine in the 
 context of confounding factors such chemotherapy and underlying disease for some of the aes.</p><p>mah stated that there is no overall difference between adult and paediatric data for ‘deaths, serious 
 adverse events and temporary discontinuation due to ae’ therefore these data were not presented by 
 age sub groups. as these data were not presented by age subgroups it is difficult to draw conclusions 
 exclusively with respect to the licensed paediatric population.</p><p>
 exposure to mylotarg was very variable with patients receiving 1 or more doses and dose levels up 
 to 9 mg/m
 2. within the smpc, aes are described in tabular form (table 5 [combination study] and 6 [monotherapy 
 study], section 4.8) as all grades of aes or grade 3-4 therefore making a direct comparison between 
 this study and those adult studies described in smpc somewhat challenging.</p><p>
 overall 95.2 % aes were reported and commonly included anaemia, reduction in wbc, platelets, 
 neutrophils and febrile neutropenia. these aes are included within the mylotarg smpc. the mah states 
 that no unexpected safety aes and no unexpected taes were noted.</p><p>
 within the paediatric population, commonly reported grade 3-5 teaes were decreased platelet count, 
 anaemia, febrile neutropenia, wbc reduction, and hypokalaemia (
 monotherapy group); platelet and wbc reduction, anaemia, neutrophil count reduction, febrile neutropenia, lymphocyte count 
 decreased, hypokalaemia, hypoxia, hyperglycaemia and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) increased 
 (
 combination group). it is reported by mah that no unexpected teaes were noted based upon safety profile of disease and complication of disease and that safety data were consistent with adult studies.</p><p>
 hypoxia and hypokalaemia are not mentioned in smpc for mylotarg but, however, are mentioned in 
 fda label. the way in which laboratory parameters were collected in this study do not allow a robust 
 conclusion on these observed aes to warrant a change to smpc. however, it is recommended that 
 hypoxia and hypokalaemia should be further assessed and reported in following pv activities for this 
 drug.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 in this study, overall, most common teaes included anaemia, reduced wbc, platelet reduction, febrile neutropenia (
 monotherapy group); anaemia, febrile neutropenia, wbc reduction, platelet and neutrophil count reduction (
 combination group) and febrile neutropenia and platelet reduction (apl treatment group
 ). smpc (section 4.8) states that selected data considered most important in understanding the drug’s safety profile, including teaes of haemorrhages, vod, and severe infections 
 and all determined to be adrs
 . although aes of special interest do occur including vod and haemorrhage, in this study haemorrhage is much less common with the exception of the apl group, 
 than described in the smpc. all the paediatric patients with haemorrhage were from the combination 
 therapy group.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia, although mentioned in the monotherapy table 6 of section 4.8 of smpc, is not 
 described within the combination group of the smpc and is also a common feature of the combination 
 arm of this study.</p><p>
 treatment-related aes, overall in the study population, (aes that the investigator believed had at least 
 a reasonable possibility of being related to mylotarg) were reported for 58.3% patients 
 overall:60.4%, 55.7%, and 77.8% patients in the monotherapy, combination, and treatment for apl 
 groups, respectively. treatment-related saes were reported for 21.8% patients. common traes were 
 similar to teaes (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia).</p><p>most common trae 
 were decreased wbc, platelet count and anaemia (
 monotherapy group); anaemia and febrile neutropenia (
 combination group); febrile neutropenia and platelet count decreases (apl treatment group,
 ). there are no paediatric patients in apl treatment group. it is difficult to determine how these aes could be solely attributed to mylotarg due to confounding factors of underlying disease and 
 treatment. 
 overall in the study population, common treatment related saes were febrile neutropenia, sepsis and 
 reduced platelet (
 monotherapy group) ; febrile neutropenia, septic shock and sinusitis (combination group
 ) and febrile neutropenia (apl treatment group)</p><p>clinically relevant saes described in the smpc for the adult studies are infusion related reactions (2.5%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and

 haemorrhage (9.9%), severe infection (41.2%), and tumour lysis syndrome (1.5%) for the 
 combination group. in the smpc in monotherapy adult studies the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 
 30%) included pyrexia, nausea, infection, chills, haemorrhage, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, 
 headache, stomatitis, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and neutropenia; the most common adverse 
 reactions (&gt; 30%) in the combination therapy adult study were haemorrhage and infection.</p><p>keeping 
 in mind that aes tables within the smpc (section 4.8) describe either all grades of aes or grade 3-4 
 and this study does not capture the totality of aes, a direct comparison between safety findings of this 
 study and those already described in smpc cannot be conducted.</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>overall 34.4 % of patients died within the reporting period and 20% in paediatric population. although a large number it is not surprising given the nature of population in the study.</p><p>within the

 14 (16.7%) patients in the combination therapy group. in the monotherapy group, the most common 
 grade 5 aes were disease progression (5 [23.8%] patients). in the combination group, the most 
 common grade 5 aes were respiratory failure (3 [3.6%] patients), disease progression, sepsis, and 
 pulmonary haemorrhage (2 [2.4%] patients each. respiratory failure is not mentioned specifically 
 within the smpc, and although the mah does not recognise it as a trae, respiratory failure is defined 
 as a teae within the abbreviated clinical summary report. clarity is sought from the mah as to 
 whether the respiratory failure seen in the paediatric population was thought to be treatment related.

 the smpc the most frequent (≥ 1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the 
 combination therapy study were thrombocytopenia, vod, haemorrhage and infection and in the 
 monotherapy, studies were infection, haemorrhage, multi-organ failure, and vod. these are 
 differences noted in discontinuation, however, it is difficult to make direct comparisons with smpc-
 included data and this more complex treatment population and therefore no changes to the smpc 
 wording is currently proposed.</p></section><section><header>significant adverse events</header><p> included hepatotoxicity (vod, sos). all hepatotoxic (vod) patients were from the paediatric subgroup and frequency ranged for 0.7-1.2 % which appears overall to be less 
 than stated in the smpc, however it is difficult to make a direct numerical comparison. similarly, this is 
 the case for haemorrhages with the exception of the apl group where there were no paediatric 
 patients. as a trend, paediatric patients were more affected by myelosuppression compared to adult 
 patients. in the paediatric subgroup,</p><p>1 (4.8%) patient had grade 3 tls in monotherapy and 
 combination therapy, 3 (1.6%) patients had tls</p><p>(grade 3 severity). in the paediatric subgroup, the 
 most commonly reported ae of serious infection was device-related infection (monotherapy) and 
 sepsis, sinusitis and device related infection (combination therapy). overall these significant saes as 
 well as infusion related events are detailed within the current smpc adult studies.</p><p>
 renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, second primary malignancy as rare adverse events were found in this 
 study but are not described within the clinical overview report as traes or teaes; equally they are not 
 described within the smpc. it is not clear if these are adult or paediatric patients.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.  
 rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation</header><p>overall the data presented in this expanded access study are generally consistent with the known safety profile of mylotarg as well as those of the underlying disease.</p><p>febrile neutropenia, although 
 mentioned in the monotherapy adult study only (section 4.8, table 6) of smpc, is described here in 
 the combination arm of this study. as discussed this maybe reflective of the fact that only selected aes 
 were included within table 5 (
 combination therapy) of smpc and this is a study in a very complex and heterogenous treatment population compared to the licensed indication. hypoxia and hyperkalaemia 
 are seen in paediatric population; and rare events of second primary malignancy, neurotoxicity, renal 
 failure do occur, however it is unclear if these were treatment related and whether they occurred in 
 adult or paediatric patients. respiratory failure is mentioned as a cause of death but the mah is asked 
 to clarify whether this was related to treatment or not.</p><p>
 overall, the rapporteur considers that due to the study limitations, changes to the smpc paediatric 
 related safety information based on this study for mylotarg are not proposed at this time.</p></section><section><header>fulfilled:   not fulfilled:</header><p>based on the data submitted, the mah should provide additional clarifications requested below as part of this procedure.

 in the monotherapy, combination, and treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl) groups, 
 respectively (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table 14.3.1.2.9.2). 
 deaths of patients in the study were not collected on a separate crf; however, grade 5 aes were 
 collected on the ae crf. all deaths were reported if they occurred during the sae reporting period 
 (from the time the patient had taken at least 1 dose of protocol treatment through 60 calendar days 
 after the last administration of mylotarg) (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr). 
 all-causality grade 5 aes were reported for 7 (33.3%) and 14 (16.7%) paediatric patients in the 
 monotherapy and combination groups, respectively. no paediatric patients were included in the acute 
 promyelocytic leukaemia (apl) group. more than 1 grade 5 ae could have been reported per patient. 
 in the monotherapy group, the most common grade 5 aes for paediatric patients were disease 
 progression (5 [23.8%] patients), cardiac arrest, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, chloroma, and 
 respiratory failure (each 1 [4.8%] patients). in the combination group, the most common grade 5 aes 
 for paediatric patients were respiratory failure (3 [3.6%) patients), pulmonary haemorrhage, sepsis, 
 and disease progression (each 2 [2.4%] patients) (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table 
 14.3.1.2.9.2). narratives were written for all aes leading to death (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr

 the four reported cases, patient had an event of respiratory failure in the course of disease progression 
 that was considered to be possibly related to mylotarg by the investigator, however considered not 
 related by the sponsor. summaries of each of the events are listed below: 
 patient is an 11 year old male patient with relapsed aml who received mylotarg as a single agent on 
 07aug2016. the patient was transferred from an outside institution with the inability to extubate him. 
 at the time of transfer on 06aug2016 the patient was stable on the ventilator, awake and alert with 
 blood counts showing white blood cell count (wbc) of 7580 and 86% circulating blasts. 
 physical exam was remarkable for decreased breath sounds on the left and massive 
 hepatosplenomegaly. his wbc decreased as did his percentage of circulating blasts but his lung 
 disease persisted on the left side. wbc dropped from 6350 with 87% blasts to 0.800 with 68% blasts 
 on 10aug2016. a ct of the head/chest/abdomen on 10aug2016 showed a large chloroma in the left 
 frontal brain and in the brain stem, several in the abdomen (liver and kidneys) and a very large one in</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 the left chest with pleural effusion. after reviewing the ct findings, mylotarg was stopped and the patient died on 10aug2016. the investigator and company assessed that the events of respiratory 
 failure, asystole, left lung pleural effusion, left frontal lobe chloroma, brainstem chloroma and left chest 
 chloroma as unrelated to mylotarg (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr section 14.3.3.1). 
 patient is a 12 year old female with relapsed/refractory aml who was treated with fludarabine and 
 cytarabine from 16jun2017 to 20jun2017 with mylotarg on 17jun2017 (day2). on 17jun2017, prior to 
 receiving mylotarg, the patient had new respiratory symptoms with a possible pneumonia and small 
 pleural effusion on x-ray. subsequent imaging showed worsening pleural effusions, requiring a right 
 thoracentesis. the etiology was suspected to be due to prolonged neutropenia prior to the most recent 
 therapy. on 26jul2017, the patient died with a cause of death of disease progression, with pleural 
 effusion and respiratory failure as fatal events. the investigator assessed pleural effusion and 
 respiratory failure as possibly related to mylotarg. the company assessed these events as unrelated to 
 mylotarg (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr section 14.3.3.1). 
 patient is a 10-year-old male with relapsed/refractory aml who was treated with mylotarg from 
 03apr2017 to 09apr2017. the patient experienced respiratory failure and sepsis on 01jun2017. on 
 01jun2017, patient started having altered mental status, difficulty walking and then vomited and likely 
 aspirated based on his respiratory decompensation. in the emergency department, he was saturating 
 in 80s on room air and was not responsive even to painful stimuli. he was intubated with great 
 difficulty and multiple attempts due to copious secretions which had particulates suggestive of 
 aspiration. he required high vent settings. despite transfusions, he continued to have hypotension 
 requiring several epinephrine boluses. after much work to stabilize him, he was transported to picu. 
 in the picu patient continued to be hypotensive despite increasing doses of inotropes and boluses of 
 calcium. as his blood pressures continued to decrease, parents elected to remove life support. the 
 patient died on 01jun2017, cause of death was disease progression, respiratory failure and sepsis. 
 autopsy was not done. the investigator and company assessed that the events of respiratory failure 
 and sepsis as unrelated to mylotarg (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr section 14.3.3.1). 
 patient is a 12 year old male patient with refractory aml who received mylotarg on 23nov2016 as part 
 of a combination regimen. the patient also received busulfan, iv intermittent, as transplant 
 prophylactic at 30 mg every 6 hours (38 mg q6h from 04jan2017 to 07jan2017). the patient was 
 found to be in minimal residual disease (mrd) negative remission on 18jan2017 and was referred for a 
 bone marrow transplant. he started conditioning on 03jan2017 for his procedure with prophylaxis for 
 infection as well as veno-occlusive disease (vod). three days post transplant, the patient developed 
 right upper quadrant pain and was diagnosed with venoocclusive disease. he was intermittently 
 admitted to picu for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (cvvh) for renal failure, hypervolemia and 
 respiratory failure. 
 he was readmitted to picu on 21feb2017 for respiratory failure secondary to a combination of 
 idiopathic pulmonary syndrome, cytomegalovirus (cmv) pneumonitis and pulmonary edema requiring 
 cvvh. he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, ruxolitinib, entancercept in addition to 
 mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept) after developing air leak syndrome and on 10mar2017 he was 
 place on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ecmo) to aid in lung healing from air leak 
 syndrome. he had improved subcutaneous emphysema but persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on 
 chest x-ray (cxr) while on vv-ecmo. on day 15 of vvecmo with multiple days of no clinical or 
 radiographic evidence of subcutaneous emphysema, the decision was to increase his ventilator settings 
 to challenge his respiratory effort. he then developed radiographic evidence of air leak syndrome again 
 with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. day 21 on vvecmo on 30mar2017, family 
 and multidisciplinary team decided to discontinue ecmo support. the patient died on 30mar2017 with</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 withdrawal of support. the cause of death was respiratory failure, autopsy was performed. the investigator and company considered there was not a reasonable possibility that the event respiratory 
 failure was related to mylotarg (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1). 
 summary 
 in all four cases reporting respiratory failure with a fatal outcome the patients suffered severe 
 complications associated with the progressive nature of the underlying acute leukaemia or subsequent 
 treatment. there were no new safety information or unusual trends identified that would have altered 
 the established benefit-risk profile of the product.</p></section><section><header>renal toxicity</header><p>the following preferred terms are summarized as possibly associated with acute renal failure: acute renal failure, renal failure, and acute kidney injury. 
 no patients in any group experienced acute renal failure.</p><p>
 in the monotherapy group, there were no paediatric patients that experienced renal toxicity. there 
 was 1 adult patient that experienced renal failure, and 2 adult patients that experienced acute kidney 
 injury: 
 patient was an adult patient that experienced a grade 5 event of renal failure in the setting of 
 refractory aml, pancytopenia, septic arthritis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and ultimately multi-organ 
 dysfunction. the renal failure was not considered to be related to study drug but was attributed to 
 disease under study (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1 and table 16.2.7). 
 patient was an adult patient that experienced grade 4 acute kidney injury, following emergency room 
 admission for diarrhea, chills, shortness of breath, cough, agitation and symptoms of septic shock. 
 blood culture was positive for gram positive cocci. the investigator concluded that the event of acute 
 kidney injury was not related to study drug. concurrent grade 4 events of platelet count decreased, 
 and tumour lysis syndrome and grade 5 events of febrile neutropenia and sepsis were assessed as 
 possibly related to mylotarg by the investigator (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1 and table 
 16.2.7). patient was an adult patient that experienced grade 3 acute kidney injury in the setting of 
 relapsed aml, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, left ventricular dysfunction (lvef 
 &lt;15%) and decreased platelets and white blood cells. the acute kidney injury was attributed to 
 disease under study and was not considered related to study drug (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, 
 table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7). 
 in the combination group, 1 adult patient experienced renal failure, and 1 adult patient and 2 
 paediatric patients experienced acute kidney injury: 
 patient is an adult patient who experienced grade 3 renal failure concurrent with an event of 
 fungaemia and grade 4 neutropenia. the events of fungaemia and renal failure were not considered to 
 be related to study drug and were attributed to disease under study (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, 
 table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7). 
 patient is an adult patient who experienced acute kidney injury. this 20-year-old female patient was 
 admitted for treatment with mylotarg plus fludarabine, cytarabine, g-csf (flag) chemotherapy. 
 treatment began on 10may2016 with most recent dose on 04jun2016. on 05jun2016, the patient 
 developed sepsis (neutropenic with gram-positive cocci in blood cultures), pulmonary edema and 
 respiratory failure / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). the patient

 intubation required on 10jun2016. acute kidney injury started on 11jun2016 with grade 4 creatinine elevation starting from 16jun2016. serious adverse event was reported as acute kidney injury (grade 
 4 creatinine elevation) with onset date 11jun2016 and serious as life-threatening and resulted in 
 death. the patient started dialysis for acute kidney injury with continuous renal replacement therapy 
 (crrt) on 16jun2016. the events, multi-organ failure and acute kidney injury overlapped, as acute 
 kidney injury never resolved: only worsened and ended at death. the patient started to have multi-
 organ failure, and this resulted in death on 19jun2016. the investigator did not believe that the death 
 was related to fatal disease progression. the investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility 
 that the event acute kidney injury (grade 4 creatinine elevation) was related to study drug mylotarg 
 and concomitant drug flag chemotherapy, but unrelated to clinical trial procedures. acute kidney 
 injury with fatal outcome was considered unrelated by the sponsor (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 
 14.3.3.1, table 16.2.7). 
 patient is a 17 year old patient who experienced grade 4 acute kidney injury following events of 
 neutropenia, decreased platelet count, and hypoxia. acute kidney injury was attributed to 
 ‘other’ cause that was not disease or study drug. (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7). 
 patient is an 8 year old patient who was enrolled in the combination group and experienced an event of 
 acute kidney injury that was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. this patient 
 received mylotarg on 15sept2017 and on 24sept2017 was brought to the emergency department with 
 febrile neutropenia. the patient developed nausea that was complicated by emesis and subsequent 
 fall. while in the emergency department, the patient started complaining of generalized abdominal 
 pain, as a result, the patient was transferred to the picu 24sep2017 for acute respiratory failure and 
 septic shock. lab results showed that the patient was pancytopenic, acidotic and had hypokalaemia 
 and was now in acute renal failure. on early morning 25sep2017 exam, the patient&apos;s breath sounds 
 were more diminished and the patient&apos;s liver edge became palpable 5-7 cm below the costal margin 
 concerning for induced cardiogenic shock in addition to septic shock. blood culture was positive for 
 gram positive cocci and the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. therapeutic measures 
 were taken as a result of sepsis. the patient also experienced pulmonary haemorrhage with onset date 
 29sep2017. he died on 29sep2017, preliminary cause of death was noted to be pulmonary 
 haemorrhage due to acute respiratory failure and coagulopathy in setting of pancytopenia. cause of 
 death was confirmed as pulmonary haemorrhage; no autopsy was performed. the event of renal 
 failure was considered to be related to study drug. the investigator and sponsor considered there was 
 a reasonable possibility that the events sepsis and pulmonary haemorrhage was related to study drug 
 mylotarg and to concomitant drug azacitidine, but unrelated to clinical trial procedure (module 5.3.5.4 
 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1, and table 16.2.7). 
 there were no patients in the apl group who experienced renal toxicity. 
 summary 
 in all seven cases reporting renal toxicity, the patients suffered complications associated with 
 myelosuppression, infection, and the progressive nature of the underlying aml. there were no new 
 safety information or unusual trends identified that would have altered the established benefit-risk 
 profile of the product.</p></section><section><header>neurotoxicity</header><p>the following preferred terms are summarized as possibly associated with neurotoxicity:</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 demyelination, neuropathy peripheral, and cranial nerve disorder. there were no patients in the monotherapy group or the apl group who reported a neurotoxicity preferred term. 
 patient was an adult patient in the combination group who experienced grade 3 neuropathy peripheral 
 concurrent with events of paraplegia (verbatim term: paralysis from low chest down), low 
 lymphocytes, low granulocytes, lymphopaenia, asthenia and</p><p>clostridium difficile infection. the investigator attributed this event of neuropathy peripheral to the disease under study and not to study 
 drug. the event of paraplegia (grade 3) resolved and was also attributed to the disease under study 
 (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7).</p></section><section><header>secondary malignancy</header><p>preferred terms from the system organ class (soc) of neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified are summarized as possibly associated with second primary malignancy. acute myeloid leukaemia is 
 the disease under study, so was not considered to be a second primary malignancy and is not 
 summarized. 
 in the monotherapy group, 2 paediatric patients experienced chloroma: 
 patient is an 18 month old male who experienced grade 3 chloroma in the setting of refractory aml, 
 multi-system organ failure due to progressive disease. this event of chloroma was considered to be 
 unrelated to study drug and was attributed to aml disease progression (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 
 14.3.3.1, table 16.2.7). 
 patient is an 11 year old male who experienced grade 5 chloroma in the setting of advanced aml. 
 events are summarized in this document, under the heading of respiratory failure. the event of grade 
 5 chloroma was not considered to be related to study drug but was attributed to disease progression 
 (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1, table 16.2.7). 
 also in the monotherapy group, 2 adult patients (patients 10131004 and 10661002) experienced 
 neoplasm progression, both of which were grade 5, unrelated to study drug and were attributed to 
 disease under study. both events were summarized in narrative reports as progression of their aml 
 (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1, table 16.2.7). 
 one adult patient (patient) in the monotherapy group experienced grade 5 unrelated neoplasm 
 malignant (attributed to disease under study). this event is summarized in the narrative as being 
 progression of the patient
 ’s aml (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr 14.3.3.1). in the combination group, 1 adult patient (patient) experienced grade 3 infected neoplasm (infectious 
 cervical mass), concurrent with anemia, febrile neutropenia and fungal pneumonia. this event was 
 considered to be unrelated to study drug and was attributed to disease under study (module 5.3.5.4 
 b1761026 csr, table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7). 
 also, in the combination group, paediatric patient experienced grade 3 tumour pain, which was 
 concurrent with neutrophil and lymphocyte count decreased and paraesthesia. the event of tumour 
 pain was considered to be unrelated to study drug and attributed to disease under study (module 
 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7). 
 no patients in the treatment for apl group reported preferred terms in the soc of neoplasms benign, 
 malignant, and unspecified (module 5.3.5.4 b1761026 csr, table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and table 16.2.7).</p></section><section><header>summary</header><p>the search for “second primary malignancy” included a broad preferred terms search and thus it identified aes other than second primary malignancies (e.g., non-malignant aes, primary</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 malignancies). in the study none of the identified aes were considered to be secondary primary malignancies.</p></section><section><header>conclusion</header><p>the observed aes were consistent with the known safety profile of mylotarg and there were no unexpected major safety findings in this study population. in this study, both adult and paediatric 
 patients experienced events of renal toxicity and events that fall under the soc of neoplasm benign, 
 malignant and unspecified while one adult patient experienced an event associated with neurotoxicity. 
 the majority of the events summarized were due to the underlying disease and/or effects of prior 
 chemotherapy and in the setting of myelosuppression. there were no new safety information or 
 unusual trends identified that would alter the established benefit-risk profile of the product.</p></section><section><header>assessment of mah response  respiratory failure</header><p>of the 4 patients described within the paediatric population with respiratory failure, the mah explains that 3 out the 4 were not related to mylotarg treatment. one case of respiratory failure was possibly 
 related to mylotarg by the investigator, but the company assessed these events as unrelated to 
 mylotarg. the explanation provided that this was unrelated to mylotarg is acceptable as 
 respiratory events occurred prior to commencing mylotarg.</p></section><section><header>renal toxicity</header><p>monotherapy group: the mah provided the following information: 
 • 
 there were no paediatric cases of renal toxicity.</p><p>(1 adult with acute renal failure not attributed 
 to mylotarg but to disease; and 2 adults with acute kidney injury (aki), not related to study drug 
 but to disease).</p><p>
 combination group there were:</p><p> 
 • 
 1 adult patient with renal failure not attributable to mylotarg but the disease.</p><p>
 • 
 1 adult patient with aki. the investigator considered that there was reasonable possibility that 
 aki was due to mylotarg and concomitant drug chemotherapy. the aki with fatal outcome was 
 considered unrelated by the sponsor. it is recognised that events surrounding this case would be 
 difficult to attribute solely to mylotarg, however, this potential serious adrs should be continued to 
 be monitored.</p><p>
 • 
 paediatric patients were a 17 year old with aki which the mah reports were unrelated to 
 mylotarg. an 8 year old with aki and subsequent renal failure was considered to be related to the 
 study drug. the patient died with cause of death noted to be pulmonary haemorrhage due to acute 
 respiratory failure and coagulopathy in setting of pancytopenia. the investigator and sponsor 
 considered that a reasonable possibility that events of sepsis and pulmonary haemorrhage where 
 related to the study drug and to concomitant drug use but unrelated to clinical trial procedure.</p><p>
 the events surrounding renal toxicity should be continued to be monitored, especially as they are not 
 detailed in section 4.8 of the smpc.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 none of the aes were considered to be secondary primary malignancies.</p></section><section><header>conclusion</header><p>in view of the mah’s clarification, it is agreed that the majority of events were related to confounding factors such as underlying disease, myelosuppression or chemotherapy related effects.</p><p>a change to 
 the smpc with regards to this safety information is not recommended at this stage.</p><p>
 however, this study does provide additional evidence regarding treatment for relapsed or refractory 
 aml in the paediatric population; although the mah does not plan to seek this indication, it is strongly 
 recommended, that the totality of available paediatric data from relapsed and refractory aml studies 
 are reviewed and submitted to seek a paediatric indication for this patient group. the mah is 
 encouraged to enter a meaningful discussion with regulatory authorities on the details of such a 
 submission, overcoming any limitations of bibliography data and taking into account also the current 
 clinical experience on the field.</p><p>
 finally, the mah should continue safety monitoring of adrs including those for renal toxicity, hypoxia, 
 hypokalaemia; and febrile neutropenia in the combination therapy.
