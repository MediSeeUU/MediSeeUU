 based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
 the chmp considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
 mylotarg in the approved indication remains favourable and 
 therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
 authorisation with unlimited validity. 
  1 notifications are issued for type i variations and article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type ii variation or extension application or a worksharing application). opinions are issued for all other procedures. 
 2 a commission decision (cd) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex ii, labelling, package leaflet). the cd is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of article 23.1a(a) of regulation (eu) no. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

 update of sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the smpc 
 based on the final results from study b176103; this 
 is a single-arm, open-label, phase 4 study evaluating 
 the qt interval, pharmacokinetics, and safety of 
 gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single-agent regimen 
 in patients with relapsed or refractory cd33-positive 
 acute myeloid leukemia.  the rmp version 2.2 has 
 also been submitted. in addition, the mah took the 
 opportunity to introduce some editorial changes in 
 the product information.
