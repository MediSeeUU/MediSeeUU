 problem statement 
 disease or condition</header><p>acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is a serious heterogeneous group of lymphoid disorders resulting from the clonal proliferation of immature precursor b- or t-cell lymphocytes (blasts) in blood, bone 
 marrow, and other lymphatic (e.g. lymph nodes and spleen) and non-lymphatic organs (e.g. cns, liver 
 and bones). the disease occurs with a bimodal age distribution: 55% of cases diagnosed in patients &lt; 
 20 years of age, and 28% of cases diagnosed in adult patients ≥ 45 years of age {national 
 comprehensive cancer network 2020}. the estimated overall incidence of all in the eu is 1.28 per 
 100,000 individuals per year, with a higher incidence rate (1.45 per 100,000 individuals per year) among 
 adults aged 75 to 99 years {hoelzer 2016}. five-year overall survival rates for children are 89%, 
 survival rates for adults remain low at approximately 20% to 40% (approximately 20% for adults 
 ≥ 60 years of age), and the majority of all deaths are in adults {siegel 2020}. 
 all can be classified in 3 subtypes: b-cell precursor all, mature b
 ‑cell all, and t‑cell all. b-all represents the most common form of all in adult patients. further, 25% of adult patients with all have 
 ph
 ‑positive (ph+) disease {national comprehensive cancer network 2020}. ph+ status confers a very poor prognosis with 5-year os and relapse-free survival (rfs) rates of 8% and 0%, respectively 
 {pullarkat 2008}.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 10/119</p><p>
 the pathogenic causes of all are unknown. however, a couple of endogenous factors as defect congenital dna repair mechanisms and exogenous factors (secondary neoplasia after radiotherapy or 
 chemotherapy) are considered to contribute to the development of all.</p></section><section><header>biologic features</header><p>cd19, the target antigen of kte-x19, is a transmembrane protein, which is expressed in the b-cell lineage. cd19 expression is maintained in most b-cell malignancies (cll, a subset of multiple myeloma, 
 subtypes of non-hodgkin b-cell lymphoma) and all.</p></section><section><header>clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>the prognosis for r/r b-all after failure of first line treatment has improved by the bispecific cd19-directed cd3 t-cell engaging agent blinatumomab, which is approved in the eu as monotherapy for 
 treatment of adults with cd19 positive</p><p>r/r b-precursor all. ph-positive patients should have received 
 prior treatment with at least 2 tkis. blinatumomab is also indicated as monotherapy in paediatrics one 
 year old or older with ph-negative cd19-positiv b-precursor all, refractory or after at least two prior 
 therapy regimens or after prior allogenic hsct. the eu-approval of inotuzumab ozogamicin in 2017, a 
 cd22-directd antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of adults with r/r cd22-positive b-precursor 
 all also contributed to an improvement of the rates for overall survival for patients in the 
 refractory/relapsed situation.</p></section><section><header>unmet medical need</header><p>with each subsequent relapse, the prognosis gets worse. a retrospective analysis of 1,706 adult subjects with ph
 − r/r b-all found that the cr rate after first, second, and third or greater salvage therapy was 40%, 21%, and 11%, respectively. median os decreased with each subsequent line of therapy; median 
 os after first, second, and third or greater salvage therapy was 5.8, 3.4, and 2.9 months, respectively 
 {gokbuget 2016b, kantarjian 2003, o&apos;brien 2013}. patients in second or later relapse may receive 
 therapies utilized in the second line, such as allo- or auto-sct. however, only few patients are eligible 
 for sct. blinatumomab or inotuzumab may be evaluated also as third line treament if not previously 
 used; however, outcomes with these treatments are typically not as favourable in patients being treated 
 in the third line and beyond. subjects receiving blinatumomab as a third or later line of therapy for b-
 all had a median os of 5.1 months compared with 11.1 months for those receiving blinatumomab as 
 their second line {dombret 2019}. the combined cr/cri/crh rate was also lower for subjects receiving 
 blinatumomab as a third or later line therapy compared with those receiving blinatumomab as the 
 second-line therapy (39.5% vs 51.0%, respectively). in the ino-vate study, the cr/cri rate was 77.8% 
 for subjects receiving inotuzumab as the second line and 66.1% for those receiving inotuzumab as the 
 third-line therapy {kantarjian 2019}.</p><p>
 results of the tower study with a median dor of 7.3 months among subjects achieving cr/cri/crh 
 indicate that durability of response to blinatumomab was limited.</p><p>twenty-four percent of subjects in the 
 blinatumomab arm underwent a subsequent allo-sct. moreover, mortality rates following subsequent 
 allo-sct were high; among 38 subjects who achieved a cr/cri/crh to blinatumomab and underwent 
 allo-sct, 10 subjects (26%) died during a median follow-up period of 206 days. the importance of cr 
 rates in oncological trials, especially in clinical trials of leukemia is acknowledged, as cr is associated with 
 more durable response {saygin 2016}, fewer infections and a reduced need for blood product support {u. 
 s. department of health and human services (dhhs) 2018}. in accordance to esmo guidelines patients 
 in the refractory disease stage or in second or later relapse are recommended to participate in clinical</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 11/119</p><p>
 trials for novel treatment, what per se supports the need for new therapy concepts. in addition to these efficacy limitations, there are concerns regarding safety. binatumomab requires continuous intravenous 
 (iv) infusion, and hospitalisation is recommended for a minimum of 9 days of the first cycle and the first 
 2 days of the second cycle {blincyto 2020}, while inotuzumab is associated with an increased risk of 
 veno-occlusive hepatic disease, which could interfere with the potentially curative effects of allo-sct.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 about the product</header><p>tecartus is a gene therapy medicinal product containing autologous t cells genetically modified whereby a patient’s own t cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral 
 transduction using an mscv based gamma-retroviral vector to express a car comprising an anti-cd19 
 single chain variable fragment (scfv) linked to cd28 co-stimulatory domains and cd3-zeta signalling 
 domain . the transduced anti-cd19 car t cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back into the 
 patient, where they can recognise and eliminate cd19 expressing target cells. tecartus binds to cd19 
 expressing cancer cells. following anti-cd19 car t cell engagement with cd19 expressing target cells, 
 the cd28 co-stimulatory domain and cd3-zeta signalling domain activate downstream signaling 
 cascades that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of 
 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of 
 cd19 expressing target cells.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.

 inotuzumab.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.  
 quality aspects</header><p>the quality change being proposed concerns the drug product dose when tecartus is manufactured for the new b-all indication. 
 when manufactured for the currently authorised mcl indication, tecartus drug product is filled at a 
 target dose of 2.0 × 10e6 cells per kg patient weight (maximum of 2.0 × 10e8 cells for patients &gt;100 
 kg). when manufactured for the proposed b-all indication, tecartus drug product will be filled at a 
 target dose of 1.0 × 10e6 cells per kg patient weight (maximum of 1.0 × 1e08 cells for patients &gt;100 
 kg) to align with clinical safety and efficacy data. 
 the dose of kte-x19 is a calculated value derived from patient body weight, measurements of viable 
 cell concentration, and % transduction. kte-x19 is manufactured to a target dose of either 1.0 × 106 
 anti-cd19 car-positive viable t cells per kg patient weight (maximum allowable dose: 1.0 × 108 anti-
 cd19 car-positive viable t cells for a ≥ 100 kg patient) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) 
 patients, or 2.0 × 106 anti-cd19 car-positive viable t cells per kg patient weight (maximum allowable 
 dose: 2.0 × 108 anti-cd19 car-positive viable t cells for a ≥ 100 kg patient) for mantle cell 
 lymphoma (mcl) patients.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 12/119</p></section><section><header n="2.2.6">2.2.6  discussion on quality aspects</header><p>besides mantle cell lymphoma (mcl; authorised indication), patients with b-all are included to be treated with tecartus. the manufacturing process is the same and also all ds/dp specifications are the 
 same as for the initial indication of mcl. the only difference is the target dose of car-19 positive cells 
 here the specification on the dp levels is 1-2x10e6 cell/kg in mcl and 1x10e6 cells/kg in b-all. the 
 respective inclusion of the additional specification of the dose (which is based on weight, viable cells 
 and car-19 positive cells) is considered acceptable.</p><p> 
 the mah did not provide any batch data of ds/dp batches manufactured from b-all patient material. 
 the mah was asked to provide a tabulated overview of all available clinical batch data on b-all.</p><p>this 
 data should include the results of the ipc.</p><p>
 overall, the batch data for tecartus indicate a certain variation which is donor dependent. a 
 comparable variation is expected for b-all material. therefore, it may not be possible to see whether 
 there is a certain trending for one of the indications. a comparable range in terms of cd3+ purity is 
 expected to be acceptable for b-all compared to mcl, but needs to be confirmed by data. 
 the mah was asked to provide a tabulated overview of all available clinical batch data that have been 
 manufactured based on the starting material derived from b-all patients. this table should include the 
 results for the in-process controls.</p><p>
 the mah provided the requested clinical batch data, including a tabulated overview on the results of the in-process controls. the maa has been updated by including the batch data in section 3.2.p.5.4.1,

 pharmacokinetics</header></section><section><header>methods</header><p>the pharmacokinetic profile of kte-x19 was assessed by means of measuring the peak, area-under- the-curve from day 0 to day 28 (auc0-28; defined from baseline [day 0] to day 28), time-to-peak, and 
 levels in blood over time for anti-cd19 car t cells at multiple time points after kte-x19 infusion. the 
 pharmacokinetic methods used in zuma-3 were developed and qualified internally by kite pharma, inc. 
 (rep-01261 and rep-16761) to detect and quantify anti-cd19 car t cells in blood by droplet digital 
 polymerase chain reaction (ddpcr). the ddpcr method is specific for the anti- cd19 car transgene 
 present in genomic dna derived from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of 
 subjects who have received kte-x19. as multiple gene copies can be integrated into a single human t 
 cell, the ddpcr method is used to estimate anti-cd19 car transgene vector copy number (vcn). the 
 ddpcr method quantifies the number of copies of the anti-cd19 car transgene and the housekeeping 
 gene adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit beta 1 (ap3b1) in dna using specific primers and 
 probes.</p></section><section><header>table 1. summary of pharmacokinetic methods</header><p>category/method</p><p> description pharmacokinetics

 modified toxicity management (37.7 cells/μl), followed by subjects treated at the following dose levels 
 (from the highest to the lowest): 1e6 cells/kg with original toxicity management (26.5 cells/μl); 0.5e6 
 cells/kg (68 ml; 23.1 cells/μl); 2e6 cells/kg (8.6 cells/μl); and 0.5e6 cells/kg (40 ml; 4.7 cells/μl). 
 concerning the</p><p>median auc0-28, median time-to-peak was 8 days for subjects treated either at 1e6 
 cells/kg with modified toxicity management or 0.5e6 cells/kg (40 ml); 9 days in subjects treated at 
 either 1e6 dose cells/kg with original toxicity management or 0.5e6 cells/kg (68 ml); and 15 days in 
 subjects treated at 2e6 cells/kg. two subjects in the phase 1 1e6 dose cohort (modified toxicity 
 management) had undetectable anti-cd19 car t cells in blood at both day 7 and week 2: 1 subject 
 achieved a cr and 1 subject relapsed per the investigators’ assessment. 
 combined phase 1 and phase 2 cohorts: 
 median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell levels and auc0-28 for subjects in phase 2 (median peak: 20.6 
 cells/μl; median auc0-28: 220.60 cells/μl•days) were similar to those for subjects in the combined 
 phase 1 and phase 2 1e6 dose cohorts (median peak: 24.3 cells/μl; median auc0-28: 242.90 
 cells/μl•days). the pattern of car t-cell expansion was similar in phase 2 and in the combined phase 1 
 and phase 2 1e6 dose cohorts. median anti-cd19 car t-cell time-to-peak was 15 days for subjects in 
 phase 2 and for those in the combined phase 1 and phase 2 1e6 dose cohorts. by month 6, levels of 
 anti-cd19 car t cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 22 of 28 subjects (79%) with evaluable 
 samples and by month 12, levels of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 18 
 of 20 subjects (90%) with evaluable samples (listing 14.5.7.2).</p><p>anti-cd19 car t-cell levels in most 
 phase 2 subjects declined to undetectable levels at month 6. three subjects at month 15 and one subject 
 at month 18 had low levels of anti-cd19 car t-cell that were marginally above the ddpcr assay detection 
 limit. peak levels of anti-cd19 car t cells for these subjects were substantially higher relative to levels 
 at months 15 and/or 18. detection of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood samples at months 15 and/or 18 is 
 likely attributable to assay sensitivity, with minor fluctuations in anti-cd19 car t-cell levels over time 
 above or below the assay lod.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 15/119</p><p>
 the median peak anti-cd19 car t-cell level for subjects in phase 2 was 20.6 cells/μl, and the median time-to-peak was 15 days after the kte-x19 infusion. the median area under-the-curve from day 0 to 
 day 28 (auc0-28) was 220.6 cells/μl•days. for subjects with evaluable samples, levels of anti-cd19 
 car t cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 22 of 28 subjects (79%) by month 6 and in 18 of 
 20 subjects (90%) by month 12.

 baseline. 
 day 3: median il-2, il-6, il-7, il-10, il-15, and interferon [ifn]-γ serum levels were elevated by ≥ 2-

 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and other translational medicine analyses presented are derived from data from n=55 subjects treated with kte-x19 in the zuma-3 clinical trial with a data cutoff date 
 of 09 september 2020 and a potential median study follow-up of 16.4 months. the assessments were 
 based on current knowledge of mechanism of action of kte-x19. pharmacodynamic (pd) endpoints were 
 levels of cytokines in serum and levels of b-cells over the time; levels of anti-cd19 car t cells in blood 
 was the pharmacokinetic (pk) endpoint in the study. exploratory endpoints were investigation of 
 associations among pd, pk, efficacy and safety outcomes. the median total number of anti-cd19 car t 
 cells in kte-x19 infusion products was 75.7 x 106 cells (range: 39.3 x 106 to 101.0 x 106 cells), and 
 the median total number of t cells infused was 128.4 x 106 cells (range: 65.5 x 106 to 277.8 x 106 
 cells). all but one of the 55 subjects (98%) received within 10% of the planned target dose.</p><p>the median 
 time-to-peak of anti-cd19 car t cell levels in blood occurred at day 15 after infusion of kte-x19. both 
 median anti-cd19 car t cell levels and auc0-28 were higher in patients who were in cr/cri compared 
 to patients, who did not achieve cr/cri and/or relapsed, in patients who were mrd negative versus 
 patients who were mrd positive, in males versus females and in subjects with grade 2 or higher crs.</p><p>
 the 18 preselected serum analytes had their peak generally around day 7-8 after administration of kte-
 x19 and decreased to baseline-levels by week 4. the following key associations with grade 3 or higher 
 crs and/or neurotoxicity have been observed:</p><p>
 • positive association for grade 3 or higher crs and peak serum levels of ferritin, granzyme b, il-2rα, il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, ifn-γ, tnf-α, and gmcsf. 
 • positive association for grade 3 or higher neurologic aes and peak serum levels of il-1ra and il-6. • positive association for grade 2 or higher neurologic aes and peak serum levels of il-1ra, il-2rα, il-10, and ifn-γ. 
 these results can be considered consistent with the known mechanism of action of anti-cd19 car t cells 
 in general, which is induction of cytokines and inflammatory cytokines after lymphodepletion and 
 chemokines after car t-cell infusion.</p><p>
 results on association of kte-x19 characteristics with pk, efficacy and safety outcomes revealed no 
 potential trend by median peak of car t cells or auc0-28
 .there was also no significant relationship observed between product characteristics by quartile and key efficacy (cr/cri) and safety outcomes 
 (crs and neurologic aes). however, those observations are of limited value due to the small number of 
 subjects in the respective subgroups.</p><p>
 notwithstanding, some important results regarding possible associations of product characteristics by 
 quartile and adverse events could be identified: 
 • higher incidence of grade 3 or higher crs in subjects who received products that produced lower ifn-γ in co-culture and in subjects who received a lower total number of anti-cd19 car t cells. 
 • higher incidence of grade 3 or higher neurologic aes or serious grade 3 or higher neurologic aes in subjects who received products with higher levels of ifn-γ produced in co-culture, a higher total 
 number of anti-cd19 car t cells, lower percentages of cd4+ t cells, higher percentages of cd8+ 
 t cells, and a lower cd4:cd8 ratio. 
 • higher incidence of serious infections or grade 3 or higher serious infections in subjects who received products that had lower levels of ifn-γ produced in co-culture and in subjects who received 
 products with a lower percentage of cd4+ t cells, a higher percentage of cd8+ t cells, and a lower 
 cd4:cd8 ratio.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 31/119</p></section><section><header n="2.3.5">2.3.5.  
 conclusions on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the results presented on clinical pharmacology for kte-x19 in n=55 adult patients with r/r all (zuma-3) largely are comparable with those provided for the marketing authorisation of tecartus in the 
 indication mantle cell lymphoma after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy, granted on 14 december 
 2020 as a conditional approval.</p><p> however, due to the limited number of patients, results on the 
 pharmacology of kte-x19, particularly in specific clinically meaningful subgroup analyses such as ph-
 positive and/or negative patients, tumor burden at baseline etc., should be considered with caution. 
 ifn-γ, cd8+ cells and cd4+ cells seem to be clinically important in view of both analysis on their 
 suitability as potential surrogate markers for car t cell persistence and in view of relation to the 
 occurrence of adverse events ≥ grade 3. according to the literature database, investigations on 
 correlations between car t cells in blood ifn-γ- and further important ifn-levels in plasma as well as 
 the role of cd8+ and cd4+ on efficacy and safety of car t cell therapy are ongoing; currently, however 
 there seems to be no final conclusion on their suitability as markers. further investigations on 
 pharmacology parameters, subgroups considered, and possible relationships between kte-x19 product 
 specifics and occurrence of adverse events would be needed.</p><p>
 the presented data is acceptable to support the clinical pharmacology of the new indication in all in the

 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg showed the highest efficacy, a manageable safety profile, and the most favorable benefit-risk profile across the doses evaluated. therefore, the dose 
 of 1 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg (maximum dose of 1 x 108 anti-cd19 car t cells for subjects ≥ 100 kg) was considered the recommended phase 2 dose. 
 in the phase 2 portion of zuma-3, 55 subjects were treated with kte-x19 at a dose of 1.0 x 10
 6 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg. the primary analysis was planned to occur when the overall study enrollment was 
 complete and the last treated subject in phase 2 modified intent-to-treat (mitt) analysis set had had 
 the opportunity to complete the month 6 disease assessment. at the time of the data cutoff date for the 
 primary analysis, all subjects in the mitt analysis set had had the opportunity to be followed for at least 
 10 months after the kte x19 infusion. this overview summarizes the results of the primary efficacy and 
 safety analyses for subjects in zuma-3 phase 2 with a data cutoff date of 09 september 2020. subjects 
 in phase 1 were not part of the pivotal analysis. 
 kte-x19 was administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (conditioning therapy) 
 consisting of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day on day −4, day −3, and day −2; and cyclophosphamide 900 
 mg/m2/day administered iv on day −2.</p></section><section><header>objectives outcomes/endpoints</header><p>primary endpoint ocr rate (cr and cri) per central assessment</p><p>

 to be assessed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of kte-x19. with this sample size the study was 
 expected to have approximately 93% power to distinguish between an active therapy with a 65% true</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 34/119</p><p>
 overall complete remission rate from a therapy with an overall complete remission rate of 40% or less with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
 of note in the original study protocol, a different calculation was presented, assuming with the same 
 planned sample size of approximately n=50 a power of 86% to distinguish between an active therapy 
 with a 40% true overall complete remission rate from a therapy with an overall complete remission 
 rate of 20% or less with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. this planning included a futility assessment 
 after n=20 patients.</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>this is a single arm study.</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>this is a single arm study, and therefore open-label.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>analysis and covariates an exact binomial test was planned to be used to compare the observed response rate to the threshold 
 of 40%. this is acceptable for a phase 2 exploratory study. however, there is concern that 
 heterogeneity in patients’ prognosis might have an impact on results in this single arm study, thus 
 limiting a confirmatory interpretation.</p><p>
 upon request, the applicant confirmed that cr rates are heterogeneous in the literature (an i^2 
 estimate of 52% was observed for the results of the meta-analysis of cr rates). 
 the applicant referred to literature stating that heterogeneous definitions of cr may be the reason for 
 this observed heterogeneity. it is agreed that this may be an explanation, however, this does not 
 resolve uncertainty on possible cr rates. thus, uncertainty remains. 
 significance level and multiplicity 
 the planned significance level of 0.025 (one-sided) is in principle acceptable. however, the phase 2 
 part of the study is intended to be interpreted as a single pivotal study, implying that results should be 
 compelling, also by means of statistical significance</p><p> 
 a hierarchical approach was chosen to test the secondary endpoint of minimum residual disease 
 negative rate against the threshold of 30% upon rejection of the primary null hypothesis of complete 
 remission ≤40%. a hierarchical approach is acceptable. the hierarchical testing was introduced in 
 amendment 4 (10 march 2017). 
 interim analyses 
 according to the latest version of the protocol, one interim analysis was planned for safety only. 
 however there were several changes to interim analyses: 
 initially, two interim analyses were planned after 20 and 35 patients in phase 2 in the mitt set had 
 the opportunity to be followed for 8 weeks or 28 days after infusion respectively, with assessments 
 planned for futility and safety. this was subsequently changed several times during the course of the 
 study:</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 35/119</p><p>
 in amendment 3 (28 july 2016), the second interim analysis with 35 patients was planned to assess early demonstration of efficacy, and a lan-demets alpha-spending function with o’brian-fleming type 
 boundaries was planned for multiplicity control. 
 assessment of efficacy at interim analysis 2 was removed in amendment 4 (10 march 2017), but the 
 interim analysis was kept for other purposes. 
 finally, in protocol amendment 6 (31 october 2018) the second interim analysis was removed. 
 the timing of the interim analyses was amended several times throughout the study as well. 
 changes to the protocol 
 as discussed above, there were several relevant changes to interim analyses, hypotheses and 
 multiplicity. 
 although most of them were introduced before the first patient was enrolled to phase 2 (on 01 october 
 2018), this may reflect that the study was initially planned as an exploratory trial with some 
 uncertainty. given the above discussion, the assessors conclude that not all uncertainty can be 
 resolved, and a confirmatory interpretation remains difficult. however, given the circumstances, an ad-
 hoc interpretation of results seems warranted.</p><p>
 historical control and meta-analyses of outcomes in r/r all 
 the rationale for a prespecified 40% ocr historical control rate was informed by rates observed in 
 published studies of second-line or later chemotherapy and sct regimens and in pivotal studies of 
 blinatumomab. the blinatumomab studies, which included patient populations similar to those enrolled 
 in zuma-3, resulted in cr/crh rates of approximately 42%; the cr rates were 32.4% in the phase 2 
 study (study mt103-211) and 33.6% in the phase 3 tower study. by comparison, standard-of-care 
 chemotherapy for subjects in the tower study yielded a cr rate of 15.7% and cr/crh rate of 20.1% 
 {blincyto 2019, kantarjian 2017}.</p><p>
 in order to allow matched subject comparison, a prespecified, retrospective, matched-cohort study 
 derived from individual subject-level data sampled from historical clinical trials (hcts) contained within 
 the medidata enterprise data store (meds) database. meds is a collection of thousands of previous 
 clinical trials with subject-level data recorded through the medidata electronic data capture system, 
 rave. this companion study, referred to as scholar-3, was matched to the zuma-3 phase 2 mitt 
 analysis set and was intended to provide context for interpreting the zuma-3 results and confirm the 
 prespecified control response rate. 
 a total of 40 subjects previously naïve to blinatumomab and inotuzumab treatment were included in the 
 study; 20 from zuma-3 matched to 20 from historical trials; this was referred to as synthetic control 
 arm 1 (sca-1). a further 49 blinatumomab or inotuzumab pretreated subjects were also included in the 
 study; 29 from zuma-3 matched to 20 from historical trials; this was referred to as synthetic control 
 arm 2 (sca-2). data for ocr and os were available for sca-1; only os data were available for sca-2. 
 no appropriate matches from hcts were found for 6 subjects from the zuma-3 mitt population; these 
 subjects were thus excluded. 
 note that 29 subjects in sca-2 were originally matched with 29 subjects from zuma-3; however, 9 
 subjects in sca-2 were later excluded from the analysis since they did not have a documented relapse 
 prior to starting a subsequent therapy. in a post hoc analysis, ocr rate and os were compared between 
 all subjects from zuma-3, irrespective if they had previously been pre-treated with blinatumomab or</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 36/119</p><p>
 inotuzumab, versus matched subjects from hcts who had not previously been treated with blinatumomab or inotuzumab; this was referred to as synthetic control arm 3 (sca-3).</p></section><section><header>results participant flow

 of these, 7 subjects had achieved a cr and 2 subjects had achieved a cri to kte-x19 treatment (based 
 on the central assessment). one subject received an allo-sct after achieving a cri per investigator</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 53/119</p><p>
 assessment, however, was considered to have a best response of bfbm per central assessment. the median time from kte-x19 infusion to allo-sct was 98 days (range: 60 to 207 days). of the 10 subjects 
 who received allo-sct after kte-x19 infusion, 1 subject (10%) died within 100 days after allo-sct. the 
 remaining 9 subjects (90%) were in ongoing remission 100 days after the transplant. 
 5.</p><p>overall survival (os) 
 km estimates of os at month 12 and month 18 were 71.4% (95% ci: 57.0%, 81.7%) and 58.6% (95%

 a reverse km median follow-up time for os of 15.5 months (95% ci: 13.1, 17.6 months). the km median 
 os was not reached (95% ci: 16.2 months, ne) for subjects with cr or cri and was 2.4 months (95% 
 ci: 0.7 months, ne) for all other subjects in the mitt analysis set. the km median os was not reached 
 (95% ci: 18.2 months, ne) for subjects with cr and was 9.0 months (95% ci: 3.2, 14.2 months) for 
 subjects with cri. with regard to patients who were mrd-, the km median os was not reached (95% 
 ci: 16.2 months, ne) and was 9.5 months (95% ci: 2.2 months, ne) for subjects who were mrd+ and 
 1.5 months (95% ci: 0.3, 2.7 months) for subjects with missing mrd assessments.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 54/119</p><p>- subgroup analyses of os at month 12 (mitt analysis set)</p><p>
 the km estimate of os at month 12 in the mitt analysis set was examined in diverse clinical relevant 
 subgroups of age, race, gender, baseline disease characteristics, prior lines of therapy etc. (
 source: figure 11, clinical efficacy report body
 ). os rates were comparable for subjects who had been previously treated with blinatumomab (53%, n = 25); inotuzumab (54%, n = 12); sct (78%, n= 23); sct and 
 blinatumomab (64%, n= 11); sct and inotuzumab (60%, n = 5); and sct, blinatumomab, and 
 inotuzumab (50%, n = 2). moreover, os rates were 100% among elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age (n 
 = 8), 50% among subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline (n = 6), and 93% among subjects 
 who were ph+ (n = 15). these rates were generally consistent with the km estimate of os at month 12 
 of 71.4% observed for the overall</p><p>population.</p><p>

 km estimates of rfs rates at month 6 and mont 12 were 57.6% (95% ci: 42.6%, 69.9%) and 44.3% 
 (95% ci: 28.6%, 59.0%), respectively. the km median rfs was 11.6 months (95% ci: 2.7, 15.5 
 months), with a reverse km median follow-up time for rfs of 11.7 months (95% ci: 3.2, 15.0 months). 
 twenty-six subjects were censored:</p><p>

 twelve subjects relapsed, 1 subject died, and 16 subjects did not have a best response of cr or cri. 
 among subjects with cr or cri, the km median rfs was 14.2 months (95% ci: 11.6 months, ne). the 
 km median rfs was 15.5 months (95% ci: 11.6 months, ne) for subjects with cr and 11.7 months

 or had missing mrd assessments. subgroup analysis of rfs had been conducted for month 6 only and 
 not for month 12. given the generally small number of patients in the respective subgroups, overall, the

 sample size of 78 treated subjects; 2) a 21-month follow-up analysis with a substantially longer median 
 follow-up of 20.5 months (range: 0.3, 32.6 months, data cut off [dco] 23 july 2021) over the primary 
 analysis with a median follow-up of 12.4 months (range: 0.3, 22.1 months, dco 09 september 2020); 
 and 3) an update of the scholar-3 results with a full analysis set (fas) analysis to include subjects 
 who did not receive kte-x19 infusion in zuma-3. in addition, scholar-3 analyses for the original 
 modified intent-to-treat (mitt) analysis set were repeated with a more recent date cutoff (dco 23 july 
 2021). 
 among the 78 subjects treated with the pivotal dose in the combined phase 1 + phase 2 analysis set, 
 37% had previously received an allo-sct, 49% had received prior blinatumomab, and 22% of the 
 subjects had received prior inotuzumab therapy. the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 
 to 8); 19% had received 1 line, 33% had received 2 lines, 24% had received 3 lines, and 23% had 
 received ≥ 4 lines of prior therapy. a total of 31% of the subjects had primary refractory disease, 77% 
 had r/r disease to ≥ 2 line of therapy, 38% had r/r disease after allo-sct, and 28% had first relapse 
 with first remission lasting ≤ 12 months. the median percentage of blasts in bone marrow at baseline 
 was 63.0% (range: 0% to 98%); 12% of the subjects had an extramedullary disease. the updated</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 61/119</p><p>
 central assessment data of the 78 subjects treated with the pivotal dose in the combined phase 1 + phase 2 analysis set continue to demonstrate a significant clinically meaningful benefit compared with 
 currently available therapies. risks associated with kte-x19 treatment in zuma-3, such as crs and 
 neurologic events, mostly occurred in the first month after cell infusion and were largely reversible and 
 manageable with medical intervention. 
 the results of the 21-month follow-up analysis demonstrated that the efficacy outcomes obtained with 
 kte-x19 in the phase 2 mitt analysis set and fas continue to be better than reported outcomes obtained 
 with current standard of care (soc) therapies. efficacy outcomes were numerically better in subjects 
 who had received only 1 prior line of therapy compared with subjects who had received &gt; 1 prior line of 
 therapy before kte-x19. furthermore, subjects who had received an allogeneic stem cell transplant 
 (allo-sct) as well as sct-naïve subjects greatly benefited from kte-x19 irrespective of their previous 
 transplant status, while the flexibility for treating physician remained should they consider a subsequent 
 allo-sct. better efficacy outcomes were obtained with kte-x19 in blinatumomab-naïve and inotuzumab-
 naïve subjects, whereas a prior exposure to blinatumomab or inotuzumab suggests a potential reduction 
 in the efficacy of kte-x19. however, even in subjects who had previously been treated with 
 blinatumomab or inotuzumab, kte-x19 resulted in efficacy outcomes that were better than what have 
 been reported for current soc therapies. 
 the updated scholar-3 analyses performed on the original zuma-3 mitt population and the expanded 
 analyses performed on the fas were consistent with the outcomes of the primary analysis. clinically 
 meaningful, statistically significant improvements in overall complete remission (ocr) rate, complete 
 remission (cr) rate, relapse-free survival (rfs), and overall survival (os) were demonstrated for 
 kte-x19 versus subjects receiving soc therapies in historical control trials matched for key baseline 
 characteristics and prior therapies, further supporting the clinical relevance and benefits of kte-x19 over 
 available therapies.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 62/119</p></section><section><header>table 20. efficacy outcomes in subjects with 1 versus &gt;1 prior lines of therapy

 therapy, the km median os was 25.4 months (95% ci: 14.2 months, ne)and 19.3 months (95% ci: 
 9.7 months, ne) respectively. in the combined phase 1 + phase 2 analysis set comprising a total of

 therapy; among the 63 subjects who had received &gt; 1 prior line of therapy, the km median os was 
 25.4 months (95% ci: 15.9 months, ne)</p><p>
 the km median os values of 19 to 25 months obtained with kte-x19 in zuma-3 among subjects who 
 had received &gt; 1 prior line of therapy are approximately 3-fold longer than the median os of 7.7 months 
 obtained with current soc.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 63/119</p></section><section><header>figure 6. km plot of os by number of prior therapies per central assessment: 1

 than 12 months, and a total of 2 subjects had r/r disease after allo-sct. after kte-x19 infusion, 8 out 
 of the 10 subjects achieved a cr, and 9 out of the 10 subjects achieved a cr/cri. 
 the data suggest that efficacy outcomes obtained with kte-x19 in subjects who had received &gt; 1 prior 
 line of therapy are better than outcomes obtained with current soc therapies. furthermore, efficacy 
 outcomes were numerically better in subjects who had received only 1 prior line of therapy before kte-
 x19 infusion. therefore, the applicant argues that subjects who have relapsed after only 1 treatment 
 line should be included in kte-x19 indication to provide the most optimal benefit-risk profile. this would 
 be consistent with the subject population studied in zuma-3 where 18% of the subjects in the mitt 
 analysis set, 15% in the fas, and 19% in the combined phase 1 + phase 2 analysis set had received 
 only 1 prior therapy. 
 the zuma-3 results, demonstrating that subjects with fewer lines of therapy have better outcomes, are 
 consistent with published studies reporting that with each relapse, responses to subsequent lines of 
 therapy deteriorate {dombret 2019, gokbuget 2016b, kantarjian 2003, kantarjian 2019, o&apos;brien 2013}. 
 in order to provide further context for the relationship between efficacy outcomes and the number of 
 prior lines of therapy, the applicant analyzed baseline characteristics and the profile of treatment-
 emergent adverse events (teaes) between these 2 subgroups among subjects in the phase 2 safety 
 analysis set. 
 compared with the subgroup comprising subjects who had received &gt; 1 prior line of therapy, the 
 subgroup comprising subjects who had received only 1 prior line of therapy had more subjects with 
 ecog performance status of 0 (40% versus 27%); fewer subjects who had received prior blinatumomab, 
 inotuzumab, or an allo-sct (10%, 0%, and 10% versus 53%, 27%, and 49%, respectively); fewer 
 subjects with r/r disease after allo-sct (20% versus 49%); more subjects with first remission lasting 
 ≤ 12 months (50% versus 24%); and subjects had a lower tumor burden (median percentage of blasts 
 in bone marrow at baseline of 47.4% [range: 0, 73%] and no subject with an extramedullary disease at 
 screening versus median percentage of blasts in bone marrow at baseline of 65.0% [range: 2, 98%] and 
 13% of subjects with an extramedullary disease. due to the imbalance regarding the number of subjects 
 in these 2 subgroups (10 subjects who received 1 prior line versus 45 subjects who received &gt; 1 prior 
 line of therapy), these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 65/119</p></section><section><header>table 23. baseline characteristics by number of prior lines of therapy (phase 2,

 naïve and subjects treated with a prior allo-sct to receive kte-x19. prior exhaustion with an allo-sct 
 was not a mandatory inclusion criterion, and the majority of enrolled subjects in zuma-3 were allo-sct-
 naïve; only 39% of subjects in phase 2 fas and 42% of the treated subjects in phase 2 mitt analysis 
 set had received a prior allo-sct. the percentage of subjects with prior allo-sct in zuma-3 is similar to 
 that of published studies in r/r all with blinatumomab and inotuzumab where 35% of the subjects in 
 the tower study and 18% of the subjects in the ino-vate study had prior allo-sct (</p></section><section><header>error! reference source not found.</header><p>). out of the 55 treated subjects, 11 (20%) in the zuma-3 mitt analysis set received an allo-sct after 
 kte-x19 infusion; out of the 11 subjects, 10 (18%) had achieved a cr/cri per central assessment. out 
 of the 11 subjects who received a subsequent allo-sct, 1 subject died within 100 days, and the 
 remaining subjects were in ongoing remission 100 days after allo-sct. 
 among the 10 subjects who achieved a cr/cri after receiving kte-x19 infusion and who received a 
 subsequent allo-sct, km median os was not reached (95% ci: 7.6 months, ne), even with the longer 
 follow-up than previously reported for the primary analysis. among the 29 subjects in the mitt analysis 
 set who achieved a cr/cri after receiving kte-x19 alone without subsequent allo-sct, the km median 
 os was 26.0 months (95% ci: 18.6 months, ne)

 the percentage of subjects (20%) in zuma-3 who received kte-x19 followed by a subsequent allo-sct is consistent with the tower study where 24% of subjects in the blinatumomab arm underwent a 
 subsequent allo-sct. in contrast to the zuma-3 results, the mortality rate in the tower study was high 
 following blinatumomab and allo-sct; among the 38 subjects who achieved a cr/cri/crh to 
 blinatumomab and underwent allo-sct, 10 subjects (26%) died during a median follow-up period of 206 
 days {kantarjian 2017}. in the ino-vate study, a substantially higher percentage of subjects proceeded 
 to sct after receiving inotuzumab; 48.2% of the subjects in the itt population and 53.7% of subjects 
 who achieved a cr/cri. among the subjects who proceeded to sct after receiving inotuzumab, 67.1% 
 of the subjects died; the median os for subjects treated with inotuzumab followed by sct was 12.6

 the already substantially improved outcomes achieved with kte-x19 alone (median os of 26.0 months) 
 over current soc (median os of 7.7 months, can be further increased with a subsequent sct (among 
 subjects who achieved a cr/cri after kte-x19 infusion and received a subsequent allo-sct, median os 
 was not reached.</p><p>
 the results presented with the more mature data set and a longer median study follow-up of 20.5 months 
 are consistent with the data previously reported for the primary analysis with a median study follow-up 
 of 12.4 months. 
 thus, the applicant continues to recommend that subjects who are sct naïve should also be eligible to 
 receive kte-x19. this is supported by zuma-3 data presented above and received by the applicant from 
 healthcare providers representing real-world experience. including allo-sct naïve subjects in kte-x19 
 label would reflect the subject population studied in zuma-3 where 58% of the enrolled subjects had not 
 received a prior allo-sct, and would be consistent with zuma-3 design, which allowed the use of a 
 subsequent allo-sct per investigator’s choice for the studied population, as outlined in the zuma-3 
 clinical study protocol (sections 7 and 10). restricting the indication to only sct-pretreated subjects 
 would limit the subsequent treatment options for those subjects who achieve a cr/cri after kte x19 
 infusion; a second sct, which is known to be associated with great risks and poor outcomes, if often not 
 advised by current guidelines {nagler 2019}.

 refractory adult b precursor all contained within the medidata enterprise data store (meds) 
 database. 
 two matched cohorts were constructed to the zuma-3 trial, one in blin and ino naïve patients and one 
 in blin experienced patients through the use of patient level data from trials selected from the 
 medidata meds database.</p></section><section><header>study selection</header><p>studies were selected through a literature search, with a search for all trials in the sub-indication of interest regardless of the availability of the trial to medidata through data sharing agreements (figure 
 below). all trials in the indication and meeting basic project criteria were identified by searching across 
 major trial repositories (nih, clinicaltrials.gov, eudract and umin-ctr) and publication databases 
 (pubmed, medline). 
 trials represented in the figure below met the following basic requirements for this study: 
 • targeted condition of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) • trial intervention contains therapies from one of the following comparator regimens: o blinatumomab o inotuzumab ozogamicin o standard of care, defined here as hidac, flag, mitoxantrone, methotrexate or clofarabine regimens 
 this search yielded 135 trials in the sub-indication of interest (box a in figure 1)</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 75/119</p><p>
 these studies were then narrowed according to the following scientific features of the trials or data that are required in order to address the research objective. (box b) 
 • relapsed / refractory disease • adult population (enrolled patients aged &gt;= 18 years) • trial intervention exact match to allowed comparator regimens and only studies were used in the end which were available through medidata data sharding 
 agreement.</p></section><section><header>matching</header><p>in order to create a matched cohort of patients to the phase ii zuma-3 study a number of key considerations were made: 
 • the zuma-3 trial contains patients who initiate therapy with kte-x19 after various numbers of previous regimens. 
 • patients in the zuma-3 trial are heterogeneous in terms of prognostic factors. • the zuma-3 trial consists of patients who are both allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-sct) experienced and naïve. 
 • some patients within the zuma-3 trial have been previously treated with the cd19 directed monoclonal antibody blinatumomab, prior to starting therapy with kte-x19.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 76/119</p><p>
 as there is evidence that prior treatment with blin may impact the efficacy of kte-x19 due to cd19 modulation (taraseviciute et al, two matched comparator cohorts are proposed; one comprising of 
 patients who have been previously naïve to blin and ino treatment, the second cohort will comprise 
 only blin experienced patients. these cohorts were thought to emulate a “physicians’ choice” arm from 
 a randomized trial with treatment exposures comprising of current standards of care (soc).</p><p>
 firstly, for each cohort (blin experienced and naïve) patients from the superset of trials were 
 characterized into the following treatment exposures to create a potential pool of matches for each 
 patient in zuma-3: 
 1. patients who in the historical trial had previously failed an allo-sct and been treated with either 
 blin, ino or soc chemotherapy; with or without a tki dependent on ph status. 
 2. patients who in the historical trial had not previously failed an allo-sct and been treated with blin, 
 ino or soc chemotherapy; with or without a tki dependent on ph status. 
 each of these matching pools consisted of patients with varying previous lines of therapy, primary 
 refractory status. age, sex, extra medullary disease status, philadelphia chromosome status, ecog 
 performance status and varying percentage of bone marrow blasts. 
 the phase ii zuma-3 trial consists of 55 patients who were treated with ktex19, a matching approach 
 was applied to select controls. 
 for the prognostic factors, line of therapy and prior allo-sct, exact matching were used. for age, sex, 
 ecog performance status, philadelphia chromosome status, percentage bone marrow blasts at 
 baseline and extramedullary disease at baseline; propensity score matching was used. 
 the propensity score was defined as the probability of patients being treated with kte-x19 as a 
 function of the above prognostic factors. it was derived using a multivariate model with a logit link 
 function. 
 the greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement algorithm was used with a fixed 1-to-1 
 matching ratio which aligns with the commonly used 1:1 randomization ratio in clinical trials.</p><p>
 either 1:1 optimal matching or variable ratio matching, with a maximum of a 1:3 ratio was planned to 
 be used. patients were matched within a specified caliper distance of 0.25 and balance between the 
 zuma-3 and matched study arms was assessed through standardized mean differences (smd). 
 only baseline variables with limited or no missingness (e.g. &lt; 15%) were included in the propensity 
 score model. missing values for baseline categorical variables were coded as an unknown category and 
 can be used as a separate category or combined with one of the non-missing categories. missing 
 values for baseline continuous variables were imputed by a single regression imputation approach 
 where the missing values were filled by predictions from regression models that are fitted using the 
 mean and covariance matrix estimated by complete case analysis.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 77/119</p></section><section><header>analysis</header><p>there is no formal hypothesis being tested as part of this study. analyses were descriptive. the balance of prognostic factors was assessed through the use of standardized mean differences 
 (smd) between the two treatment arms. 
 fisher exact test was used to calculate rate difference, associated 95% confidence interval and p-
 value. for the comparative analysis, logistic regression was used to estimate an odds ratio. 
 the analysis was similar for other endpoints.</p></section><section><header>results</header><p>balance: balance is presented by matched subcohort and in all matched patients.

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>this application for extension of indication of tecartus to include adults with b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leucemia (all) is based on the zuma-3 trial, a single-arm open-label phase i/ii clinical 
 trial, and on a historical control (scholar-3), a retrospective cohort study, sampled from 135 historical 
 phase i to iii clinical trials in r/r b-cell all (appr. 490 subjects), where patients have been treated with 
 blinatumomab or inotuzumab as soc.</p><p>
 the pivotal part of the zuma-3 trial is the phase 2, where all subjects (n=55) had been treated with a 
 target of 1 × 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight after completion of a conditioning chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on d-2, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on d-4, d-3 and d-2).</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the median age among the subjects in the pivotal phase 2 of the zuma-3 trial (mitt analysis set, n=55) was 40.0 years of age. the majority of patients had relapsed or refractory disease after 2 or more lines 
 of therapy.</p><p>subjects had a median of 2 lines of prior therapy (range: 1 to 8), 26 subjects (47%) had 
 received 3 or more lines of prior therapy. twenty-three subjects (42%) had previously received an allo-
 sct. twelve subjects (22%) had previously received inotuzumab, twenty-five subjects (45%) had</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 82/119</p><p>
 previously received blinatumomab. altogether this population is regarded as heterogenous making subgroup analyses challenging and prone to spurious results. 
 per dco, the median ocr (cr + cri) rate per central assessment was 70.9% (n=39) for all patients 
 followed for a median of 12.4 months. the cr rate was 56% (n=31), and the mrd
 - rate (assessed by central laboratory) was 76%. among the 39 subjects who achieved cr or cri, the km median dor was 
 12.8 months. none of the additional sixteen subjects included in the full analysis set (fas, n=71) had 
 achieved cr or cri at dco, therefore, results of dor in fas and mitt were identical. with regard to 
 dor (median 14.6 months) it is noticeable that 14/34 patients have been censored due to allo-sct or 
 due to start of a new treatment.</p><p>
 overall the subgroup analyses for pertinent patient characteristics gave a consistent picture. the lowest 
 response rates was observed in patients with the highest disease burden as defined by blast percentage 
 in the bone marrow. also patients with prior blinatumomab therapy, inotuzumab therapy or both 
 achieved relevant response rates albeit numerically lower than patients naïve to either or both of these 
 treatments. 
 upon request additional data have been submitted for 23 subjects from zuma-3 phase 1, centrally 
 assessed and treated with the pivotal dose of kte-x19 with a recent dco (23 july 2021), leading to a 
 median follow-up of 20.5 months. results for ocr (cr/cri; 95% ci) in the updated analysis set ph2 
 +ph1 pivotal dose (n=78) were 73.1%. the mrd negative overall rate among ocr (cr/cri; 95% ci) 
 was 79%. these results support the primary analyses.</p></section><section><header>additional expert consultation</header><p>the sag-oncology was consulted on 24 june 2022 to clarify the medical need for treatment options for adult patients, or subgroups of patients with r/r b-cell precursor all and to reflect on an appropriate 
 positioning (if any) in the therapeutic armamentarium.</p><p>
 the following questions were asked to the sag: 
 1. 
 is there a medical need for further treatment options in the indication relapsed/refractory b-
 cell precursor all in adults?</p><p>
 2. 
 can specific subgroups of patients with relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor adult all be 
 identified that are currently not sufficiently treated with available treatment options also considering 
 disease characteristics (resistant mutations, genomic alterations etc.)? 
 3. 
 besponsa and blincyto are authorised in the indication relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor all 
 in adults. are there specific subgroups of patients where these authorized options are not appropriate 
 for reasons such as the safety profile of the products or patient characteristics (e.g. co-morbidities)? 
 4. 
 would tecartus be a treatment alternative in relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor adult all 
 considering the strength of the evidence for tecartus (derived from sat, orr) and for other treatment 
 options /derived from rct, os)? 
 5. 
 how would you judge the importance of tecartus as a possible bridging to transplant and/or 
 alternative to authorized products in the indication relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor adult all? 
 6. 
 what type of data would be required to further characterize the remaining uncertainties 
 regarding efficacy in the 2l or 3l+ population, respectively? 
 the outcome of the sag is summarized below:</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 83/119</p><p>
 1. is there a medical need for further treatment options in the indication relapsed/refractory (r/r) b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) in adults?</p><p>
 the sag agreed unanimously that there is a high unmet medical need in r/r b-cell precursor all, 
 since, despite available treatments (including monoclonal antibodies blinatumomab and inotuzumab) 
 the prognosis is dismal, with high degree of relapse, non-responder patients and with low pfs and low 
 survival rates. 
 2. can specific subgroups of patients with relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor all be identified that are currently not sufficiently treated with available treatment options also considering disease 
 characteristics (resistant mutations, genomic alterations etc.)? 
 due to the fact that the evidence presented for tecartus in r/r b-cell precursor all is based on a small 
 single arm phase 2 trial with a limited number of patients, the experts cannot identify any subgroups 
 who are not sufficiently treated with available options.</p><p> 
 there aren’t any satisfactory treatments for r/r b-cell precursor all patients as a whole. groups with 
 the highest need include elderly patients, philadelphia chromosome-negative (ph-), minimal residual 
 disease positive (mrd+) and those ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allosct) or those 
 that have relapsed following allosct. the experts agreed that it is highly unlikely that these patients 
 are salvaged by the current available treatments. therefore, treating physicians need flexibility to 
 select different optional treatments.</p><p>
 3. besponsa and blincyto are authorised in the indication r/r b-cell precursor all in adults. are there specific subgroups of patients where these authorized options are not appropriate for reasons such as 
 the safety profile of the products or patient characteristics (e.g. co-morbidities)? 
 the experts flagged that the landscape in all treatment is evolving, as besponsa and blincyto are 
 moving forward in the line of treatment, leaving fewer alternatives in later lines of treatment.</p><p>
 there are no specific criteria which would render patients ineligible to besponsa and blincyto even 
 though treatment duration may be limited due to liver function or occurrence of veno-occlusive disease 
 (vod). there might be severe adverse events (aes), such as liver toxicity with inotuzumab, or pre-
 existing co-morbidities, in which cases certain treatments cannot be used and car-t cells might be 
 preferred. however, the experts cannot define a treatment sequence for the different alternatives in 
 all.</p><p>
 the experts agreed that the indication for tecartus in r/r b-cell precursor all should reflect the 
 population of patients with a positive balance of benefits and risks with the car-t treatment and not 
 the unsuitability to other treatments. a broad indication would maximise the ability of physicians and 
 patients to consider for which patients this treatment would be preferred. in addition, a broad 
 indication would allow to collect more extensive and meaningful real-world data (rwd).</p><p>
 4. would tecartus be a treatment alternative in relapsed/refractory b-cell precursor all considering the strength of the evidence for tecartus (derived from sat, orr) and for other treatment options 
 (derived from rct, os)? 
 the sag agreed that, despite the limited data, tecartus can be a treatment alternative in r/r b-cell 
 precursor all. however, the experts found that there is not enough evidence to define any optimal 
 sequence and in which subpopulation tecartus would be preferred.</p><p>
 5. how would you judge the importance of tecartus as a possible bridge to transplant and/or as alternative to authorized products in the indication r/r b-cell precursor adult all?</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 84/119</p><p>
 based on the high responses and high mrd negativity achieved with tecartus, it is reasonable to expect that it is a good candidate for bridging therapy to transplantation, taking into account all 
 limitations (e.g. the trial’s small patient group). tecartus can also be used as an alternative to 
 authorized products in the same indication. 
 6. what type of data would be required to further characterize the remaining uncertainties regarding 
 efficacy in the 2l or 3l+ population, respectively? 
 data presented for tecartus is sparse and lots of questions remain. the experts agreed that, ideally, a 
 confirmatory rct should be performed comparing tecartus with actually available treatments. the 
 experts acknowledge the difficulties to perform such a study, especially taking into account that the 
 monoclonal antibodies are moving forward in the line of treatment in all. 
 the experts agreed that patients should be included in a post-authorization registry to better 
 characterize efficacy and safety aspects and patient reported outcomes (pros).</p><p>
 in particular, more data on the safety of tecartus in this indication, more data in the elderly population 
 who are not eligible to asct and on ph - patients and mrd - patients that cannot be transplanted 
 would be very valuable.</p></section><section><header>additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional ma</header><p>in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with r/r all, the mah shall submit follow-up results of the zuma-3 clinical study (part 1 and part 2). 
 in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with r/r all, the 
 mah should conduct and submit the results of a prospective, observational study based on data from a 
 registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
 these post authorisation studies should provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and safety 
 information on important subgroups (age groups from 18 to 25 years of age and older than 60 years, 
 status mrd+ and ph-, patients that have relapsed following allo-sct), which are not fully represented 
 in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. the provision of this data post authorisation will 
 complement the dossier in order to have a comprehensive understanding of efficacy and safety and to 
 confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product in the new indication.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>based on the submitted data and the recent update encompassing 78 patients, efficacy has been demonstrated in the zuma-3 trial. the included patient population is small and heterogeneous, however, 
 subgroup analyses give a fairly consistent picture regardless of prior therapies. there is an indication for 
 lower efficacy in patients with high disease burden (high blast percentage in the bone marrow), requiring 
 further investigation in registry studies as a part of the conditional approval.</p><p>
 the following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
 in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with r/r all, the 
 mah shall submit follow-up results of the zuma-3 clinical study (part 1 and part 2).

 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>the important identified risks and the potential risks identified for kte-x19 are similar to the aes identified for this product class. no further risks and aes could be identified which would be specific for 
 kte-x19 or for the mcl indication to be treated with kte-x19. the important identified risks are crs, 
 neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. 
 the safety data for this extension to indication are based on the pivotal phase 2 of zuma-3 trial, which 
 is evaluating kte-x19 for the treatment of adult subjects with r/r b-all. additional safety data are 
 provided from 4 studies of kte-x19 in subjects with r/r mcl (zuma-2 and zuma-18, pooled as mcl), 
 r/r pediatric and adolescent all (zuma-4), and r/r cll (zuma-8).</p></section><section><header>patient exposure</header></section><section><header>exposure to lymphodepleting chemotherapy</header><p>in the main, zuma-3 study 71 patients were leukapheresed, and 55 patients were treated. all 55 subjects in phase 2 safety analysis set received the planned total body-surface-area-adjusted dose 
 of cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m

 according to the mah, six patients did not receive kte-x19 due to manufacturing failure. eight other 
 patients were not treated, primarily due to aes following leukapheresis. two patients who underwent 
 leukapheresis and received lymphodepleting chemotherapy were not treated with kte-x19; one 
 patient experienced bacteremia and neutropenic fever and the other patient did not meet eligibility 
 criteria after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 86/119</p><p>
 in phase 2, a total of 71 subjects were enrolled (ie, underwent leukapheresis); of these, 57 subjects (80%) received lymphodepleting chemotherapy. fourteen subjects received neither lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy nor kte-x19 after leukapheresis: 
 (i) seven subjects were not treated due to aes: 
 - one subject experienced various aes following leukapheresis, including tumor lysis syndrome, lung 
 infection, urinary tract infection, and sepsis. the subject died of sepsis, which was considered related 
 to bridging therapy, before they could be treated with kte-x19. 
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
 following the second leukapheresis, the subject developed a lung infection and respiratory failure and 
 died of pd before they could be treated with kte-x19. 
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. the 
 subject developed fungal pneumonia and sepsis shortly after leukapheresis and ultimately died of pd 
 without undergoing a second leukapheresis. 
 - one subject experienced an ae of deep vein thrombosis following leukapheresis, rendering this 
 subject ineligible for the study. this subject was later determined to have had symptomatic deep vein 
 thrombosis at the time of screening. 
 - one subject experienced various aes following leukapheresis, including splenic rupture, neutropenic 
 sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, and encephalopathy. the subject then died of cardiac arrest before they 
 could be treated with kte-x19. 
 - one subject experienced various aes following leukapheresis, including clostridium difficile infection, 
 septic shock, colitis infection, and myositis. the subject was removed from study per the investigator’s 
 decision. 
 - one subject developed a hemiparesis due to air embolism following leukapheresis, rendering this 
 subject ineligible for the study. the subject was subsequently treated under a compassionate use 
 protocol.</p><p>
 (ii) three subjects were identified as not meeting eligibility criteria after leukapheresis: 
 - two subjects were found to have cd19− blasts (both subjects had received prior blinatumomab). for 
 1 of these subjects, product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
 - one subject was found to have &lt; 5% blasts. 
 (iii) four subjects were not treated due to manufacturing failures: 
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. the 
 subject developed a lung infection after leukapheresis and consequently was unable to undergo a 
 second leukapheresis (reported as “product not available”). 
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
 further leukapheresis attempts were delayed as the subject had developed febrile neutropenia after 
 leukapheresis. the subject then partially withdrew consent from the study (which is the reason listed 
 for this subject not having been treated) and died of febrile neutropenia in hospice care. 
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from 3 sets of leukapheresis material. 
 further leukapheresis attempts were deferred indefinitely as the subject experienced clinical 
 deterioration (reported as “other”) and subsequently died of pd.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 87/119</p><p>
 - one subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. a second leukapheresis was not attempted per the primary oncologist’s decision that the subject was not 
 clinically stable to proceed with car t-cell therapy (reported as “other”). 
 of the 57 subjects who received lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 55 subjects received kte-x19. two 
 subjects were not treated with kte-x19 after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy: 1 subject 
 experienced aes of bacteremia and neutropenic fever that precluded further treatment, and 1 subject 
 deteriorated after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and no longer met eligibility criteria (the subject 
 experienced fulminant progression of extramedullary disease and spinal cord compression, leading to 
 ecog performance status &gt; 1).</p></section><section><header>exposure to kte-x19</header><p>in phase 2, the median weight-adjusted dose of kte-x19 was 1.0 x 106 anti-cd19 car t cells/kg (range: 0.5 x 10

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety database included 55 patients treated with kte-x19 in the zuma-3 trial. for the patients included in this assessment, the median potential follow-up time from the kte-x19 infusion was 16.4 
 months (range: 10.3 to 22.1), which is rather short.</p><p>
 among the treated subjects, 95% had grade 3 or higher aes, 75% had saes. 
 49 subjects (89%) had crs, and 13 subjects (24%) had crs that was worst grade 3 or higher. 
 no subject had grade 5 crs. among subjects who had crs, the median time to onset was 5.0 days 
 (range: 1 to 12 days) after kte-x19 infusion. as of the data cutoff date, crs had resolved in 46 of 
 49 subjects. for the remaining 3 subjects, crs was ongoing at the time of death due to pd on day 21 
 in 1 subject, brain herniation on day 8 in 1 subject, and pneumonia on day 15 in 1 subject. 
 33 subjects (60%) had at least 1 neurologic ae of any grade, including 14 subjects (25%) with worst 
 grade 3 or higher neurologic aes. one subject had a grade 5 neurologic ae of brain herniation. among 
 subjects who had neurologic aes, the median time to onset was 9.0 days (range: 2 to 16 days) after 
 kte-x19 infusion. as of the cutoff date, neurologic aes had resolved in 29 of 33 subjects. 
 important identified risks (crs, neurologic events, cytopenias, infections, and 
 hypogammaglobulinemia) were largely reversible and manageable with supportive care and medical 
 interventions.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 105/119</p><p>
 no secondary malignancies were attributed to kte-x19, no confirmed cases of immunogenicity were identified in phase 2, and none of the tested subjects were positive for rcr. one subject in phase 2 
 had grade 3 nonserious tumor lysis syndrome assessed as related to kte-x19. one subject in phase 2 
 had grade 2 nonserious gvhd assessed as related to kte-x19; the subjects had undergone allo-sct 
 prior to enrollment in zuma-3.</p><p>
 no new safety signals were identified. essentially, the aes and risks are similar to what has been 
 described for other car t cell therapies and for kte-x19 in the mcl indication. no further risks and 
 aes could be identified which would be specific for kte-x19 or for the indication to be treated with 
 kte-x19. the toxicity management plans are presented in the smpc and are in line with the general 
 management plans for this product class. 
 the relatively high number (8) of patients not treated due to aes following leukapheresis is surprizing. 
 it could be probably explained by the poor condition of patients and the natural course of the disease.</p><p> 
 upon request, additional safety data have been submitted with data cutoff july 23, 2021 regarding 
 subgroup analysis for the sas. there is no significant difference in teaes among subjects who had 
 received only 1 prior line of therapy versus subjects who had received &gt; 1 prior line of therapy, and 
 the incidence of aes and saes were generally similar (&lt; 10% difference) between the subgroups.</p><p>
 similarly, no major differences were observed when comparing teaes for sct-naïve subjects and 
 subjects who had received a prior allo-sct, when comparing age categories, or when comparing 
 patients who received blinatumomab or inotuzumab versus their corresponding naïve subjects.</p></section><section><header>additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional ma</header><p>in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with r/r all, the mah shall submit follow-up results of the zuma-3 clinical study (part 1 and part 2).

 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>patients in their second or later relapse may receive therapies typically utilized in the second line, such as allo- or auto-stem cell transplantation (sct). however, few patients in this setting are eligible for 
 sct. novel therapies approved for the second line, such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab-ozogamicin, 
 may also be utilized in the third line if not previously used, although outcomes with these treatments 
 are typically not as favourable in patients being treated in the third line and beyond. subjects receiving 
 blinatumomab as a third or later line of therapy for b-all had a median os of 5.1 months compared 
 with 11.1 months for those receiving blinatumomab as their second line {dombret 2019}. the 
 combined cr/cri/crh rate was also lower for subjects receiving blinatumomab as a third or later line 
 compared with those receiving blinatumomab as the second line (39.5% vs 51.0%, respectively). in 
 the ino-vate study, the cr/cri rate was 77.8% for subjects receiving inotuzumab as the second line 
 and 66.1% for those receiving inotuzumab as the third line {kantarjian 2019}. another study found 
 that subjects who received inotuzumab combined with low-intensity chemotherapy as the third line or 
 as a fourth or later line had 1-year os rates of 26% and 39%, respectively, compared with a 57% 1-
 year os rate in subjects receiving this combination as the second line {jabbour 2018b}. because of 
 these poor outcomes with third-line and higher therapies, the national comprehensive cancer network 
 and european society for medical oncology recommend that patients seeking treatment for r/r b-all 
 participate in clinical trials {hoelzer 2016, national comprehensive cancer network 2020}. 
 recently, kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) was approved in the treatment of b-cell all that is refractory, in 
 relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse in paediatrics and young adults up to and 
 including 25 years of age.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.

 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>data are derived from a small trial without a concurrent randomised control. as with any other trials of this size in heterogeneous populations uncertainties are therefore related to the “true” estimate for 
 efficacy and external validity. most of the analyses are presented for the mitt population, i.e. the 
 population that actually received study drug. this selection clearly biases the determined efficacy 
 estimate.</p><p>
 from a methodological point of view the typical sequence of exploration and confirmation is difficult to 
 distinguish with certainty.</p><p>
 the subgroup analyses for baseline population and disease characteristics generally give a fairly 
 consistent picture. however, the small heterogeneous population and the multitudes of univariate 
 analyses performed cannot exclude the possibility that subgroups are hidden that may not have the 
 intended favourable effects. from subgroup analyses there is some indication that baseline 
 characteristics related to higher disease burden are associated with a lower treatment response. prior 
 treatment with blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin is also associated with a lower response to 
 the experimental treatment.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>the unfavourable effects for patients treated with kte-x19 do not only occur as a consequence of kte-x19 treatment, but the bridging therapy and conditioning chemotherapy may also induce such effects. 
 nonetheless, a list of unfavourable effects has crystallized which are expected and regarded as class 
 effects for car-t cell based therapies.

 from the kte-x19 infusion was 16.4 months (range: 10.3 to 22.1). while this period would be enough 
 to identify the earlier and immediate aes, there are certain potential risks for which conclusive data 
 could not be obtained due to the limited follow-up time. therefore, aspects regarding secondary 
 malignancies, replication competent retrovirus analysis need to be appropriately assessed in the 
 follow-up study.</p></section><section><header n="3.6">3.6.

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>the final benefit-risk evaluation considers the initial clinical data set (n=55 subjects in the phase 2 portion of the zuma-3 study) and additional n=23 subjects from the phase 1 portion of the zuma-3 
 study, centrally assessed and treated with the pivotal dose.</p><p> 
 ultimately the benefit of a therapy in oncology is an improved survival. however, choosing os as an 
 endpoint requires a reliable comparison, preferably via a randomised control. for a number of reasons 
 randomised controls are often not available in the later line setting in haemato-oncology generally and 
 in the atmp field specifically. objective responses to therapy are accepted endpoints because they 
 allow to estimate a favourable effect that is causally related to the therapy in a single arm trial. 
 consequently the demonstration of a high response rate (as determined by cr) to treatment with kte-
 x19 that is also associated with the disappearance of measurable disease is regarded as highly 
 relevant. this is particularly true for a population that has received multiple previous therapies. even 
 when taking into account the uncertainties as regards the selection of the population and the concerns 
 on methodology and analyses of data the obtained response rates achieved are regarded as relevant 
 on their own. the applicant has attempted to put the achieved results into context but further analyses 
 of these datasets are necessary to come to a conclusion. achieving cr is usually regarded as a 
 prerequisite for additional therapeutic interventions but the follow-up is currently too short to 
 determine the exact role of kte-x19 in the overall treatment paradigm. it is noted that some patients 
 went on to sct as a potentially curative option, that the favourable effects appear lesser in a 
 population with worse prognostic baseline characteristics and that the trial population was quite 
 heterogeneous.</p><p>as a second component to describe the favourable effects the duration of response is 
 important to complement the results achieved for duration of response. the observed duration of 
 response is in this case particularly remarkable, especially for individuals that achieved a complete 
 response. 
 the most important unfavourable effects of kte-x19 as a car t cell product in general are crs, 
 neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia. generally these unfavourable 
 effects are either treatable or have a self-limiting course and are reversible. the potential serious 
 consequences of crs have been recognised and treatment algorithms have been developed that are 
 still being refined according to further experience. overall considering the life-threatening disease the 
 safety profile of kte-x19 seems to be acceptable for the target population. since the unfavourable 
 effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class, the identified uncertainties and 
 limitations are of limited relevance. no new safety signals were identified.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>despite the described uncertainties on the favourable clinical effects, they appear to outweigh the identified unfavourable effects and limitations of the zuma-3 trial as a single arm trial with a small 
 number of subjects treated.</p><p>the benefit is regarded as sufficiently robust to conclude on a favourable 
 b/r in the overall population in the context of a cma. 
 the benefit risk balance of tecartus in the treatment of adult patients 26 years of age and above with 
 relapsed or refractory b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all), is positive.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.3">3.7.3.  
 additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance</header></section><section><header>conditional marketing authorisation</header><p>ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 116/119</p><p>
 tecartus was initially, and currently is, approved by a conditional marketing authorisation (cma). as the underlying data supporting this new indication is regarded as not comprehensive and as it aims at 
 the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an orphan condition, and in view of the 
 foregoing, the legal requirements also apply for this extension of indication which falls within the scope 
 of article 14-a of regulation (ec) no 726/2004. 
 the cat considers that the new indication also fulfils the requirements under a conditional marketing 
 authorisation framework: 
 • the benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. • it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:</p><p>- long-term follow-up data from zuma-3: in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety 
 of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory all, the mah will submit follow-up data 
 from all treated patients with the pivotal dose in the zuma-3 trial part 1 and part 2.</p><p>
 - a registry-based study: in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus in 
 adult patients with relapsed or refractory all, the mah will submit the results of a prospective, 
 observational study investigating efficacy and safety based on data from the same registry used 
 to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of tecartus, according to an agreed protocol.</p><p>
 these post authorisation studies will provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and 
 safety information on important subgroups (age groups from 18 to 25 years of age and older 
 than 60 years, status mrd+ and ph-, patients that have relapsed following allo-sct , which are 
 not fully represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. the provision of this data 
 post authorisation will complement the dossier in order to have a comprehensive understanding 
 of efficacy and safety and to confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product in the new 
 indication. 
 • an unmet medical need will be addressed. with each subsequent relapse, the prognosis of adult patients with b-cell precursor all gets worse and there is a clear unmet medical need in this 
 disease. several medicinal products have been authorised in b-cell precursor all, most notably, 
 blinatumumab and inotuzumab ozogamicin. when compared to blinatumomab and inotuzumab 
 ozogamicin, the efficacy results in the zuma-3 trial indicate improved efficacy of tecartus 
 therefore offering a major therapeutic advantage over these two existing therapies. in addition, 
 kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) was approved in the treatment of b-cell all that is refractory, in 
 relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse in paediatrics and young adults up to and 
 including 25 years of age. tecartus therefore addresses an unmet medical need via-a-vis 
 kymriah in the adult patient population aged 26 years and above</p><p>
 in summary, tecartus provides a treatment option for which a clinically meaningful benefit was 
 demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of 
 response. thus, the availability of tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage vis-à-vis 
 existing treatments for adult patients 26 years of age and above.</p><p>
 • the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent to the fact that additional data are still required. as benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data is 
 regarded positive and in view of the medical need in the target population, an additional therapy 
 option for for adult patients 26 years of age and above with relapsed or refractory b-cell 
 precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) is considered beneficial.</p><p> ema/683619/2022</p><p>page 117/119</p><p>in addition, the cat considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow up of safety and efficacy:</p><p>
