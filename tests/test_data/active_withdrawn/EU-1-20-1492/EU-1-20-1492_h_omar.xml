 grounds for the comp opinion</header></section><section><header>orphan medicinal product designation</header><p>the comp opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2019 designation was based on the following grounds: 
 the sponsor kite pharma eu b.v. submitted on 17 july 2019 an application for designation as an 
 orphan medicinal product to the european medicines agency for a medicinal product containing 
 autologous peripheral blood t cells cd4 and cd8 selected and cd3 and cd28 activated transduced 
 with retroviral vector expressing anti cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and cultured for 
 treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). the application was 
 submitted on the basis of article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of regulation (ec) no 141/2000 on orphan 
 medicinal products. 
 having examined the application, the comp considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
 • the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous peripheral blood t cells cd4 and cd8 selected and cd3 and cd28 activated transduced with retroviral vector 
 expressing anti cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and cultured was considered 
 justified based on preliminary clinical data showing favourable survival in patients with mantle cell 
 lymphoma that relapsed after, or were refractory to, several lines of previous treatments; 
 • the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever, and weight loss. median survival is 3 to 5 years; 
 • the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the european union, at the time the application was made. 
 thus, the requirements under article 3(1)(a) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
 products are fulfilled. 
 in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the european union, 
 the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
 containing autologous peripheral blood t cells cd4 and cd8 selected and cd3 and cd28 activated 
 transduced with retroviral vector expressing anti cd19 cd28/cd3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and 
 cultured will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. the sponsor has provided 
 preliminary clinical data showing improved survival in patients who relapsed from several lines of 
 previous standard of care treatments. the committee considered that this constitutes a clinically 
 relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.  
 review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
 marketing authorisation</header></section><section><header>article 3(1)(a) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the community when the

 page 5/8</p></section><section><header>condition</header><p>mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is an aggressive subtype of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma. it constitutes 5–7% of malignant lymphoma in western europe (dreyling, ann oncol. 2017; 28(s4): iv62–71). the 
 entity is also included in the latest who classification of haematological malignancies from 2016 
 (swerdlow, blood 2016; 127(20): 2375-2390).</p><p> 
 it is a b-cell malignancy with a broad spectrum of clinical, pathological, and biological features. 
 historically, the identification of the chromosomal translocation event t(11;14)(q13;q32) and the 
 resulting cyclin d1 overexpression were of paramount importance in recognizing the clinical and 
 biological diversity of this disease, but in addition to this constitutive dysregulation of the cell cycle, 
 other mechanisms such as dna damage response alterations and activation of cell survival pathways 
 are integrated to drive mcl pathogenesis (jares, j clin invest. 2012; 122(10): 3416-23).</p><p>
 the first sign of the condition is often painless swelling in the neck, armpit or groin, caused by 
 enlarged lymph nodes. other symptoms may include night sweats, unexplained high temperatures, 
 and weight loss. the diagnosis of mcl is obtained by lymph node biopsy and bone marrow 
 aspiration. circulating mcl cells can be either detected by peripheral blood smear or flow cytometry. 
 generalised lymphoadenopathy and extranodal disease are relatively common. extranodal disease may 
 include bowel involvement (lymphomatoid polyposis). mcl is more common in men than in women 
 with a ratio of around 3:1. the median age at diagnosis is 68 years. 
 the therapeutic indication proposed for marketing authorization “
 tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) after two or more 
 lines of systemic therapy including a bruton’s tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitor
 ” falls within the scope of 
 the designated orphan condition “treatment of mantle cell lymphoma”.</p></section><section><header>intention to diagnose, prevent or treat</header><p>the medical plausibility is accepted based on the positive benefit/risk assessment of the cat/chmp.</p></section><section><header>chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature</header><p>since the designation of tecartus as an orphan drug for the treatment of mcl (13 november 2019), there have been no changes in the chronically debilitating or life-threatening nature of the condition 
 and no new therapies have improved the morbidity or mortality of mcl. 
 the comp has previously acknowledged that the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 
 3 to 5 years and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever, and weight 
 loss. the majority of patients will relapse, with median overall survival (os) of around 10-13 months in 
 patients who have progressed after chemotherapy and treatment with approved targeted agents.</p></section><section><header>number of people affected or at risk</header><p>there have been no significant changes in the prevalence of the condition.</p><p>the sponsor performed a review of epidemiological data to estimate the prevalence of mcl and 
 concluded on a 10-year prevalence estimate of 0.52 per 10,000 people in the eu in 2018. that 
 proposed estimate is based on data from only one source, namely the cancermpact (eu5: germany, 
 italy, spain, france, and the uk; 2008-2018 data). epidemiological data on mcl covering the entire eu 
 are not available.</p><p>in addition, a search on pubmed/google scholar for peer-reviews articles reporting</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000026061</p><p>
 page 6/8</p><p> 
 mcl prevalence estimates was conducted, but no information on the result of this search was presented or used for the calculation of the prevalence estimate.</p><p>
 the proposed prevalence estimate is the same estimate as was proposed by the sponsor less than a 
 year ago at the time of the orphan designation. it was then concluded that the condition was affecting 
 around 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the eu, at the time the application was made. this estimate is 
 considered acceptable.</p></section><section><header>article 3(1)(b) of regulation (ec) no 141/2000</header></section><section><header>existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
 those affected by the condition. 
 existing methods</header><p>targeted therapies currently authorized in the community for the treatment of mcl include bortezomib (velcade and generics) for newly diagnosed patients not candidates for sct, and ibrutinib (imbruvica), 
 lenalidomide (revlimid and generics), and temsirolimus (torisel) for patients with r/r disease. there 
 are also several medicinal products authorised at the national level for the treatment of the proposed 
 condition, including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, dexamethasone, 
 bendamustine, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, etoposide, chlorambucil, procarbazine. an optimal sequence 
 of treatments for relapsed or refractory (r/r) mcl has not been established. choice of regimen is 
 influenced by response duration to frontline therapy, comorbidities, tumour chemo-sensitivity, and 
 overall risk-benefit evaluations.</p><p> 
 ibrutinib is authorised as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with 
 r/r mcl. no other treatment is specifically authorised for the treatment of patients relapsing from ibrutinib in third- or 
 later lines of therapy. 
 according to the esmo guidelines, the current standard of care for first-line treatment depends on the 
 stage of mcl, the patients’ age, clinical and biological risk factors, symptoms and tumour burden 
 (dreyling, ann oncol. 2017; 28(s4): iv62-71). first-line therapy often includes chemotherapy in 
 combination with the cd20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab. numerous combination regimens 
 have been investigated, including r-chop (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine 
 and prednisone); r-cvp (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone); rituximab with 
 fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (r-fc); rituximab with bendamustine (br); rituximab with 
 cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and prednisone (vr-cap); and rituximab with 
 dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (r-dhap). frontline therapy also includes autologous stem 
 cell transplantation (sct) therapy, mainly reserved for patients ≤ 65 years of age. overall response 
 rates (orr) of up to 94% and complete response (cr) rates of up to around 40% have been achieved 
 with first-line therapies. despite high orr, the majority of patients will relapse, and outcomes in the 
 relapsed setting are much poorer. recent studies have shown a median os of 5 to 7 years in patients 
 with earlier stages of disease, but median os of approximately 10 to 13 months in patients who have 
 progressed after chemotherapy and targeted agents.</p><p>
 in the r/r situation in mcl, the treatment concepts comprise immunochemotherapy followed by 
 autologous/allogeneic sct, bruton’s tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib; both 
 approved in the us; only ibrutinib is approved in the eu), the immunomodulatory (and thalidomide 
 analogue) agent lenalidomide, the m-tor inhibitor temsirolimus and the bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax</p><p> orphan maintenance assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/od/0000026061</p><p>
 page 7/8</p><p> 
 (the latter not approved in the eu). bortezomib is approved in the eu for use in combination with r-chop for the treatment of newly diagnosed mcl and has been investigated as a monotherapy in r/r 
 mcl. 
 responses to autologous sct in relapse are inferior to those in first line and there is no consensus on 
 the benefit of its use in r/r disease (ketterer, ann oncol. 1997; 8(7): 701-4; robinson, leukemia 
 2015; 29(2): 464-73). by contrast, allogenic sct has the potential to be curative in younger r/r mcl 
 patients &lt;65 years (vose, am j hematol 2015; 90(8): 739-45), although few patients are candidates 
 for this treatment due to the advanced age of most r/r mcl patients.</p></section><section><header>significant benefit</header><p>the significant benefit of the proposed product is based on the beneficial effect in r/r mcl patients whose disease had relapsed or progressed on anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing 
 chemotherapy regimens, an anti-cd20 antibody, and a btk inhibitor.</p><p>
 the sponsor stated that the response rates observed in zuma-2 are unprecedented for subjects with 
 r/r mcl who have progressive disease despite treatment with two or more previous systemic therapy 
 regimens including a btk inhibitor. a meta-analysis of the literature demonstrated that these patients 
 have a pooled orr of 28% (95% ci: 23, 34) to salvage therapies that are currently available. by 
 contrast, zuma-2 demonstrated an orr of 85% (95% ci: 75.0, 92.3) where 59% (95% ci: 47.4, 
 70.7) of the patients achieved a cr in the full analysis set (fas; n=74 enrolled patients) after a single 
 dose of kte-x19. the lower bound of the orr ci from the primary analysis set of zuma-2 is markedly 
 higher than the upper bound of the 95% ci reported for the meta-analysis (34%). 
 the duration of the anti-tumour responses (dor), especially for the cohort achieving crs, compares 
 favourably to the dor reported in the historical cohort and is suggestive of a potential for long-term 
 remission. this is consistent with the results from the secondary endpoints, which compares favourably 
 to that reported in the literature, although median pfs and os have not been reached. in addition, for 
 patients who have progressed after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a btk inhibitor, 
 there are no products specifically authorized, and the available clinical data for tecartus support 
 improved efficacy over available alternative treatment options.</p></section><section><header n="4">4.
