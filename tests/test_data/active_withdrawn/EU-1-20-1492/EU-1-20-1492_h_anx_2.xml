 treated with tecartus. at least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome 
 (crs) and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion. the qualified treatment centre 
 must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the 
 exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the european 
 medicines agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative measures to treat crs instead of 
 tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion.</p><p>
 posology</p><p>
 tecartus is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 mantle cell lymphoma treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion for infusion of car-positive viable t cells in one container. the target dose is 2 × 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight (range: 1 x 10
 6–2 x 106 cells/kg), with a maximum of 2 × 108 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above.</p><p>
 tecartus is recommended to be infused 3 to 14 days after completion of the lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy for mcl patients. the availability of the treatment must be confirmed prior to starting 
 the lymphodepleting regimen.</p><p>
 pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) for mcl patients • a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² and fludarabine 30 mg/m² must be administered prior to infusing tecartus. the recommended days 
 are on the 5
 th, 4th, and 3rd day before infusion of tecartus.</p><p>
 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion for infusion of car-positive viable t cells in one container. the target dose is 1 × 10
 6 car-positive viable t cells per kg of body weight, with a maximum of 1 × 10
 8 car-positive viable t cells for patients 100 kg and above.</p><p>
 tecartus is recommended to be infused 2 to 14 days after completion of the lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy for all patients. the availability of the treatment must be confirmed prior to starting 
 the lymphodepleting regimen.</p><p>
 pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) for all patients a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 over 60 minutes must be administered prior to infusing tecartus. this is recommended on the 2
 nd day before 4 infusion of tecartus. fludarabine 25 mg/m2 over 30 minutess must be administered prior to infusing tecartus. the recommended days are on the 4
 th, 3rd, and 2nd day before infusion of tecartus.</p><p>
 mantle cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</p><p>pre-medication 
 • to minimise potential acute infusion reactions, it is recommended that patients be pre-medicated with paracetamol 500 to 1,000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 
 25 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent) approximately 1 hour prior to infusion. 
 • prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 monitoring prior to infusion • in some patient groups at risk, a delay of the tecartus infusion may be indicated (see section 4.4- reasons to delay treatment).</p><p>
 monitoring after infusion • patients must be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities. physicians should consider 
 hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of crs and/or 
 neurologic events. 
 • after the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the physician’s discretion. 
 • patients must be instructed to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of a qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks following infusion.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>
 elderly no dose adjustment is required in patients ≥65 years of age.</p><p>patients seropositive for hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv), or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
 there is no experience with manufacturing tecartus for patients with a positive test for hiv, active hbv, or active hcv infection. therefore, the benefit/risk has not yet been established in this 
 population.</p><p>
 paediatric population the safety and efficacy of tecartus in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. no data are available.</p><p>
 method of administration</p><p>
 tecartus is for intravenous use only.</p><p>
 tecartus must not be irradiated. do not use a leukodepleting filter.</p><p>
 before administration, it must be confirmed that the patient’s identity matches the unique patient 
 information on the tecartus infusion bag and cassette.</p><p>
 administration • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage 
 that is listed in the european medicines agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative 
 measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion. 
 • for autologous use only, verify the patient id to match the patient identifiers on the tecartus bag. 
 5 • once tubing has been primed, infuse the entire content of the tecartus bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>

 the traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. to 
 ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient must 
 be kept for a period of 30 years.</p><p>
 autologous use</p><p>
 tecartus is intended solely for autologous use and must not, under any circumstances, be administered 
 to other patients. before infusion, the patient’s identity must match the patient identifiers on the 
 tecartus infusion bag and cassette. do not infuse tecartus if the information on the patientspecific 
 cassette label does not match the intended patient’s identity.</p><p>
 general</p><p>
 warnings and precautions of lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered.</p><p>
 monitoring after infusion</p><p>
 patients must be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of 
 potential crs, neurologic events and other toxicities. physicians should consider hospitalisation for 
 the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of crs and/or neurologic events. after 
 the first 10 days following infusion, the patient is to be monitored at the physician’s discretion.</p><p>
 counsel patients to remain within the proximity of a qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks 
 following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of crs or 
 neurological adverse reactions occur. monitoring of vital signs and organ functions must be 
 considered depending on the severity of the reaction.</p><p>
 reasons to delay treatment</p><p>
 due to the risks associated with tecartus treatment, infusion must be delayed if a patient has any of 
 the following conditions: 
 • unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or hypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. 
 • active uncontrolled infection or inflammatory disease. • active graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).</p><p>
 in some cases, the treatment may be delayed after administration of the lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy regimen. if the infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after the patient has received 
 the lymphodepleting chemotherapy, lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen must be administered 
 again (see section 4.2)</p><p>
 6 serological testing</p><p>
 screening for hbv, hcv, and hiv must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing of 
 tecartus (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 blood, organ, tissue and cell donation</p><p>
 patients treated with tecartus must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation.</p><p>
 active central nervous system (cns) lymphoma</p><p>
 there is no experience of use of this medicinal product in patients with active cns lymphoma defined 
 as brain metastases confirmed by imaging. in all, asymptomatic patients with a maximum of cns-2 
 disease (defined as white blood cells &lt;5/µl in cerebral spinal fluid with presence of lymphoblasts) 
 without clinically evident neurological changes were treated with tecartus, however, data is limited in 
 this population. therefore, the benefit/risk of tecartus has not been established in these populations.</p><p>
 concomitant disease</p><p>
 patients with a history of or active cns disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac 
 function were excluded from the studies. these patients are likely to be more vulnerable to the 
 consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require special attention.</p><p>
 cytokine release syndrome</p><p>
 nearly all patients experienced some degree of crs. severe crs, which can be fatal, was</p><p>observed 
 with tecartus with a median time to onset of 3 days (range: 1 to 13 days). patients must be closely 
 monitored for signs or symptoms of these events, such as high fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, 
 tachycardia and headache (see section 4.8). crs is to be managed at the physician’s discretion, based 
 on the patient’s clinical presentation and according to the crs management algorithm provided in 
 table 1.</p><p>
 diagnosis of crs requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including 
 infection.</p><p>
 management of cytokine release syndrome associated with tecartus at least 1 dose per patient of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (il-6) receptor inhibitor, must be on site and available for administration prior to tecartus infusion. the qualified treatment centre must have 
 access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the exceptional 
 case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the european medicines 
 agency shortage catalogue, the treatment centre must have access to suitable alternative measures 
 instead of tocilizumab to treat crs.</p><p>
 treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the crs symptoms experienced by 
 patients on tecartus. these include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids, as 
 summarised in table 1. patients who experience grade 2 or higher crs (e.g. hypotension, not 
 responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygenation) must be monitored with 
 continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. for patients experiencing severe crs, consider 
 performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function. for severe or life-threatening crs, consider 
 intensive-care supportive therapy.</p><p>
 crs has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and 
 pulmonary). in addition, worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of crs. 
 patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction must be managed by standards of critical care 
 and measures such as echocardiography is to be considered. in some cases, macrophage activation 
 syndrome (mas) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh) may occur in the setting of crs.</p><p>
 7 evaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (hlh/mas) is to be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive crs.</p><p>
 tecartus continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. 
 tumour necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
 tecartus-associated crs.</p></section><section><header>table 1 crs grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>crs grade (a)

 severe neurologic adverse reactions, also known as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
 syndrome (icans), have been observed in patients treated with tecartus, which could be life-
 threatening or fatal. the median time to onset was 7 days (range: 1 to 262 days) following tecartus 
 infusion (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 8 patients who experience grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicity/icans must be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. provide intensive-care supportive therapy for severe 
 or life-threatening neurologic toxicity/icans. non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines are be considered 
 as clinically indicated for grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. treatment algorithms have been 
 developed to ameliorate the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by patients on tecartus. these 
 include the use of tocilizumab (if concurrent crs) and/or corticosteroids for moderate, severe, or 
 life-threatening neurologic adverse reactions as summarised in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2 neurologic adverse reaction/icans grading and management guidance</header></section><section><header>grading assessment

 consider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis.</p><p>infections and febrile neutropenia</p><p>
 severe infections, which could be life-threatening, were very commonly observed with tecartus (see 
 section 4.8).</p><p>
 patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before, during and after infusion and 
 treated appropriately. prophylactic antibiotics must be administered according to standard institutional 
 guidelines.</p><p>
 febrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after tecartus infusion (see section 4.8) and may be 
 concurrent with crs. in the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad 
 spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.</p><p>
 9 in immunosuppressed patients, life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections including disseminated fungal infections and viral reactivation (e.g., hhv-6 and progressive multifocal 
 leukoencephalopathy) have been reported. the possibility of these infections should be considered in 
 patients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations must be performed.</p><p>
 viral reactivation</p><p>
 viral reactivation, e.g. hepatitis b virus (hbv) reactivation, can occur in patients treated with 
 medicinal products directed against b cells and could result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and 
 death.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias</p><p>
 patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
 tecartus infusion and must be managed according to standard guidelines. grade 3 or higher prolonged 
 cytopenias following tecartus infusion occurred very commonly and included thrombocytopenia, 
 neutropenia, and anaemia (see section 4.8). patient blood counts must be monitored after tecartus 
 infusion.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia</p><p>
 b-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with 
 tecartus. hypogammaglobulinaemia was very commonly observed in patients treated with tecartus 
 (see section 4.8). hypogammaglobulinaemia predisposes patients to have infections. immunoglobulin 
 levels should be monitored after treatment with tecartus and managed using infection precautions, 
 antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement in case of recurrent infections and must be 
 taken according to standard guidelines.</p><p>
 hypersensitivity reactions</p><p>
 serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, may occur due to dmso or residual 
 gentamicin in tecartus.</p><p>
 secondary malignancies</p><p>
 patients treated with tecartus may develop secondary malignancies. patients must be monitored 
 life-long for secondary malignancies. in the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact the 
 company to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.</p><p>
 tumour lysis syndrome (tls)</p><p>
 tls, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. to minimise risk of tls, patients with 
 elevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, 
 prior to tecartus infusion. signs and symptoms of tls must be monitored, and events managed 
 according to standard guidelines.</p><p>
 prior stem cell transplantation (gvhd)</p><p>
 it is not recommended that patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant and suffer from 
 active acute or chronic gvhd receive treatment because of the potential risk of tecartus worsening 
 gvhd.</p><p>
 prior treatment with anti-cd19 therapy</p><p>
 tecartus is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with cd19-negative disease after prior 
 anti-cd19 therapy.</p><p>
 10 sodium content</p><p> 
 this medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion, equivalent to 15% of the who 
 recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.</p><p>
 long-term follow up patients are expected to enrol in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of tecartus.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no interaction studies have been performed.</p><p>
 prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids may interfere with the activity of tecartus. prophylactic 
 use of systemic corticosteroids is therefore not recommended before infusion (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 administration of corticosteroids as per the toxicity management guidelines does not impact the 
 expansion and persistence of car t cells.</p><p>
 live vaccines</p><p>
 the safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following tecartus treatment has not 
 been studied. as a precautionary measure, vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended 
 for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during tecartus treatment, and 
 until immune recovery following treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females</p><p>
 the pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential must be verified before starting tecartus 
 treatment.</p><p>
 see the prescribing information for lymphodepleting chemotherapy for information on the need for 
 effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy.</p><p>
 there are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of 
 contraception following treatment with tecartus.</p><p>
 pregnancy</p><p>
 there are no available data with tecartus use in pregnant women. no reproductive and developmental 
 toxicity animal studies have been conducted with tecartus to assess whether it can cause foetal harm 
 when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3).</p><p>
 it is not known if tecartus has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. based on the mechanism of 
 action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including b-cell 
 lymphocytopenia. therefore, tecartus is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for 
 women of childbearing potential not using contraception. pregnant women must be advised on the 
 potential risks to the foetus. pregnancy after tecartus therapy must be discussed with the treating 
 physician.</p><p>
 assessment of immunoglobulin levels and b-cells in newborn infants of mothers treated with tecartus 
 must be considered.</p><p>
 11 breast-feeding</p><p>
 it is unknown whether tecartus is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. 
 breast-feeding women must be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.</p><p>
 fertility</p><p>
 no clinical data on the effect of tecartus on fertility are available. effects on male and female fertility 
 have not been evaluated in animal studies.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>tecartus has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p><p>
 due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients must 
 not drive or operate heavy or potentially dangerous machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or 
 until resolution of neurologic adverse reactions.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profile</p><p>

 cytokine release syndrome crs occurred in 91% of patients. twenty percent (20%) of patients experienced grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) crs. the median time to onset was 3 days (range: 1 to 13 days) and the 
 median duration was 9 days (range: 1 to 63 days). ninety-seven percent (97%) of patients recovered 
 from crs.</p><p>
 the most common signs or symptoms associated with crs among the patients who experienced crs 
 included pyrexia (94%), hypotension (64%), hypoxia (32%), chills (31%), tachycardia (27%), sinus 
 14 tachycardia (23%), headache (22%), fatigue (16%), and nausea (13%). serious adverse reactions that may be associated with crs included hypotension (22%), pyrexia (15%), hypoxia (9%), tachycardia 
 (3%), dyspnoea (2%) and sinus tachycardia (2%). see section 4.4 for monitoring and management 
 guidance.</p><p>
 neurologic events and adverse reactions neurologic adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients. thirty-two percent (32%) of patients experienced grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) adverse reactions. the median time to onset 
 was 7 days (range: 1 to 262 days). neurologic events resolved for 113 out of 125 patients (90.4%) 
 with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 708 days). three patients had ongoing neurologic 
 events at the time of death, including one patient with the reported event of serious encephalopathy 
 and another patient with the reported event of serious confusional state. the remaining unresolved 
 neurologic events were grade 2. ninety-three percent of all treated patients experienced the first crs 
 or neurological event within the first 7 days after tecartus infusion.</p><p>
 the most common neurologic adverse reactions included tremor (32%), confusional state (27%), 
 encephalopathy (27%), aphasia (21%), and agitation (11%). serious adverse reactions including 
 encephalopathy (15%), aphasia (6%) and confusional state (5%) have been reported in patients 
 administered tecartus. icans was reported as a serious adverse neurologic reaction at a low 
 frequency (2%) in clinical trials. icans observed during clinical studies are represented under the 
 adverse reaction encephalopathy. serious cases of cerebral oedema which may become fatal have 
 occurred in patients treated with tecartus. see section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 icans was reported in the context of neurologic toxicity in the post marketing setting.</p><p>febrile neutropenia and infections febrile neutropenia was observed in 12% of patients after tecartus infusion. infections occurred in 87 of the 182 patients treated with tecartus in zuma-2 and zuma-3. grade 3 or higher (severe, 
 life-threatening or fatal) infections occurred in 30% of patients including unspecified pathogen, 
 bacterial, fungal and viral infections in 23%, 8%, 2% and 4% of patients respectively. see section 4.4 
 for monitoring and management guidance.</p><p>
 prolonged cytopenias cytopenias are very common following prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy and tecartus therapy.</p><p> 
 prolonged (present on or beyond day 30 or with an onset at day 30 or beyond) grade 3 or higher 
 cytopenias occurred in 48% of patients and included neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (27%) and 
 anaemia (15%). see section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>
 hypogammaglobulinaemia hypogammaglobulinaemia occurred in 12% of patients. grade 3 or higher hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 1% of patients. see section 4.4 for management guidance.</p><p>
 immunogenicity</p><p>
 the immunogenicity of tecartus has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
 (elisa) for the detection of binding antibodies against fmc63, the originating antibody of the 
 anti-cd19 car. to date, no anti-cd19 car t-cell antibody immunogenicity has been observed in 
 mcl patients. based on an initial screening assay, 17 patients in zuma-2 at any time point tested 
 positive for antibodies; however, a confirmatory orthogonal cell-based assay demonstrated that all 17 
 patients in zuma-2 were antibody negative at all time points tested. based on an initial screening 
 assay, 16 patients in zuma-3 tested positive for antibodies at any timepoint. among patients with 
 evaluable samples for confirmatory testing, two patients were confirmed to be antibody-positive after 
 treatment. one of the two patients had a confirmed positive antibody result at month 6. the second 
 patient had a confirmed positive antibody result at retreatment day 28 and month 3. there is no 
 evidence that the kinetics of initial expansion, car t-cell function and persistence of tecartus, or the 
 safety or effectiveness of tecartus, were altered in these patients. 
 15</p><p>reporting of suspected adverse reactions reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 tecartus, a cd19-directed genetically modified autologous t-cell immunotherapy, binds to cd19 
 expressing cancer cells and normal b cells. following anti-cd19 car t-cell engagement with cd19 
 expressing target cells, the cd28 co-stimulatory domain and cd3-zeta signalling domain activate 
 downstream signalling cascades that lead to t-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector 
 functions and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. this sequence of events leads to 
 killing of cd19-expressing cells.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects</p><p>
 in both zuma-2 and zuma-3, after tecartus infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated 
 over a 4-week interval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules 
 in blood. levels of cytokines and chemokines such as il-6, il-8, il-10, il-15, tnf-α, 
 interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) and il-2 receptor alpha were analysed. peak elevation was generally 
 observed within the first 8 days after infusion and levels generally returned to baseline within 28 days.</p><p>
 due to the on target, off-tumour effect of tecartus a period of b-cell aplasia may occur following 
 treatment.</p><p>
 translational analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of 
 crs or neurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and auc at 1 month) of multiple serum 
 analytes, including il-6, il-10 and tnf-α, were associated with grade 3 or higher neurologic adverse 
 reactions and grade 3 or higher crs.</p><p>
 clinical efficacy and safety</p><p>
 relapsed or refractory mcl: zuma-2 the efficacy and safety of tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl who had previously received anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti cd20 antibody, 
 and a bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (btki) (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib), was evaluated in a phase 2 
 single-arm, open-label, multi-centre trial. eligible patients also had disease progression after last 
 regimen or refractory disease to the most recent therapy. patients with active or serious infections, 
 prior allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct), detectable cerebrospinal fluid 
 malignant cells or brain metastases, and any history of cns lymphoma or cns disorders were 
 ineligible. in zuma-2, a total of, 74 patients were enrolled (
 i.e. leukapheresed) and 68 of these patients were treated with tecartus. three patients did not receive tecartus due to manufacturing 
 failure. two other patients were not treated due to progressive disease (death) following leukapheresis. 
 one patient was not treated with tecartus after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy due to 
 16 ongoing active atrial fibrillation. the full analysis set (fas) was defined as all patients who underwent leukapheresis. a summary of the patient baseline characteristics is provided in table 4.</p></section><section><header>table 4 summary of baseline characteristics for zuma-2

 this medicinal product contains human blood cells. healthcare professionals handling tecartus must 
 take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of 
 infectious diseases.</p><p>
 preparation prior to administration</p><p>
 • verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the tecartus metal cassette. 
 24 • the tecartus infusion bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patientspecific label does not match the intended patient. 
 • once the patient id is confirmed, remove the infusion bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of humanderived material (and 
 immediately contact kite).</p><p>
 thawing</p><p>
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. • thaw tecartus at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. tecartus must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion. thawing should 
 take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, tecartus is stable at room temperature (20 °c – 25 °c) for up to 3 hours. however, tecartus infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 administration</p><p>
 • for autologous single use only. • tocilizumab and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion and during the monitoring period. in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage 
 that is listed in the european medicines agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative 
 measures to treat crs instead of tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion. 
 • a leukodepleting filter must not be used. • central venous access is recommended for the administration of tecartus. • verify the patient id again to match the patient identifiers on the tecartus bag. • prime the tubing with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) prior to infusion. 
 • infuse the entire content of the tecartus bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>
 • gently agitate the bag during infusion to prevent cell clumping. • after the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) to ensure 
 all the treatment is delivered.</p><p>
 precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product</p><p>
 unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with tecartus (solid and liquid 
 waste) must be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local 
 guidelines on the handling of waste of human-derived material.</p><p>
 accidental exposure 
 in case of accidental exposure to tecartus local guidelines on handling of human-derived material 
 must be followed. work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with tecartus 
 must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.</p><p>

 6. contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header n="1">1. what tecartus is and what it is used for</header><p>tecartus is a gene therapy medicine used for treating mantle cell lymphoma and b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults. it is used when other medicines have stopped working for you 
 (relapsed or refractory disease). the medicine is made specially for you from your own white blood 
 cells that have been modified and is known as brexucabtagene autoleucel.</p><p>
 mantle cell lymphoma and b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are cancers of a part of the immune 
 system (the body’s defences). they affect a type of white blood cell called b-lymphocytes. in both 
 mantle cell lymphoma and b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, b-lymphocytes grow in an 
 uncontrolled way and build up in the lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood.</p></section><section><header>how tecartus works</header><p>the white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target the cancer cells in your body. when tecartus is infused into your blood, the modified white blood 
 cells will kill the cancer cells.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. what you need to know before you are given tecartus 
  you are not to be given tecartus</header><p>– if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you think you 
 may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
 –</p><p>if you can’t receive the medicine to reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood 
 (
 lymphodepleting chemotherapy) (see also section 3, how tecartus is given).</p><p>
 38</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>tecartus is made from your own white blood cells and must only be given to you (autologous use).</p></section><section><header>tests and checks  before you are given tecartus your doctor will:</header><p>• check your lungs, heart, kidney and blood pressure. • look for signs of infection or inflammation; and decide whether you need to be treated before you are given tecartus. 
 • check if your cancer is getting worse. • look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. this happens when transplanted cells attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, 
 diarrhoea and bloody stools. 
 • check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. this will show if you are likely to develop a condition called 
 tumour lysis syndrome. you may be given medicines to help prevent the condition. 
 • check for hepatitis b, hepatitis c or hiv infection. • check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months. 
 • check if you have previously received a treatment that attaches to the protein called cd19.</p><p>
 in some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with tecartus. if 
 tecartus infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received lymphodepleting 
 chemotherapy you may have to receive more chemotherapy (see also section 3, how tecartus is 
 given).</p></section><section><header>after you have been given tecartus  tell your doctor or nurse immediately or get emergency help right away if you have any of the 
 following:</header><p>• chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea which may be symptoms of a 
 condition known as 
 cytokine release syndrome. take your temperature twice a day for 3 to 4 weeks after treatment with tecartus. if your temperature is high, see your doctor immediately. 
 • fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
 • fever (e.g. temperature above 38°c), which may be a symptom of an infection. • extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red blood cells. 
 • bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood known as platelets.</p><p>
 if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p>
 your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
 components may decrease.</p><p>
 you will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term 
 effects of tecartus.</p><p>
 do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplants. 
 39</p></section><section><header>children,adolescents and young adults</header><p>tecartus must not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age or young adults below 26 years of age.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and tecartus</header><p>tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p><p>
 before you are given tecartus tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
 your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
 tecartus.</p><p>
 in particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
 • in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy to prepare your body for the tecartus cells. 
 • during tecartus treatment. • after treatment while the immune system is recovering.</p><p>
 talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. this is because the effects of tecartus in 
 pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
 breast-fed child. 
 • if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with tecartus, talk to your doctor immediately. 
 • you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. tecartus can only be given if the results show you are not pregnant.</p><p>
 discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received tecartus.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>tecartus can cause problems such as altered or decreased consciousness, confusion and seizures (fits) in the 8 weeks after it is given.</p><p>
 do not drive, use machines, or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after 
 your tecartus treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered.</p></section><section><header>tecartus contains sodium, dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and gentamicin</header><p>this medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion bag. this is equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. it 
 also contains dmso and gentamicin which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how tecartus is given</header><p>tecartus will always be given to you by a healthcare professional.</p><p>
 • since tecartus is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you to prepare your medicine. your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in 
 your vein (a procedure call 
 leukapheresis). some of your white blood cells are separated from 40 your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. this can take 3 to 6 hours and may need to be repeated. 
 • your white blood cells are sent away to a manufacturing center to make your tecartus. it usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to make tecartus but the time may vary.</p></section><section><header>medicines given before tecartus treatment</header><p>a few days before you receive tecartus, you will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which will allow the modified white blood cells in tecartus to multiply in your body when the medicine is given 
 to you.</p><p>
 during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given tecartus you may be given other medicines. this is 
 to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. these other medicines may include: 
 • paracetamol. • an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.</p></section><section><header>how you are given tecartus</header><p>tecartus will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre.</p><p>
 • tecartus is given in a single dose. • your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of tecartus through a catheter placed into your vein (
 intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. • tecartus is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells. your healthcare professional handling the treatment will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves 
 and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local 
 guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material to clean up or dispose of any 
 material that has been in contact with it.</p></section><section><header>after you are given tecartus</header><p>• you must stay close to the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after tecartus treatment. your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily for at least 10 days 
 or that you stay at the hospital as an in-patient for the first 10 days after tecartus treatment. this 
 is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and help you if you have any side 
 effects.</p><p>
 if you miss any appointments, call your doctor or your treatment centre as soon as possible to 
 reschedule your appointment.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. do not try to treat your side effects on your own.</p><p>

 &lt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;</p></section><section><header>the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</header><p>it is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering tecartus.</p><p> 
 precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product</p><p>
 tecartus must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.</p><p>
 this medicinal product contains human blood cells. healthcare professionals handling tecartus must 
 take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of 
 infectious diseases.</p><p>
 work surfaces and materials that have potentially been in contact with tecartus must be 
 decontaminated according to local guidelines on the handling of waste of human-derived materials.</p><p>
 preparation prior to administration</p><p>• verify that the patient’s identity (id) matches the patient identifiers on the tecartus metal cassette. 
 • the tecartus infusion bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. 
 • once the patient’s id is confirmed, remove the infusion bag from the metal cassette. • check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. • inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. if the bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material (or 
 immediately contact kite).</p><p>
 thawing</p><p>
 • place the infusion bag inside a second bag. 45 • thaw tecartus at approximately 37 °c using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
 cellular material. if visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
 small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. tecartus must not 
 be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion. thawing should 
 take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
 • once thawed, tecartus is stable at room temperature (20 °c – 25 °c) for up to 3 hours. however, the infusion must begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion.</p><p>
 do not use a leukodepleting filter.</p><p>
 administration • the medicine must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with experience in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and 
 management of patients treated with tecartus. 
 • ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. hospitals and associated centres should have 
 access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. in the 
 exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the 
 european medicines agency shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable alternative measures to 
 treat crs instead of tocilizumab are available on-site. 
 • the patient’s identity must be matched with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag.</p><p>• tecartus is for autologous use only.</p><p>• tecartus must be administered as an intravenous infusion using latex-free intravenous tubing without a leukocyte depleting filter within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.</p><p>
 • gently agitate the bag during infusion to prevent cell clumping. all contents of the infusion bag must be infused.</p><p>
 • sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) (0.154 mmol sodium per ml) solution for injection must be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. when the full 
 volume of tecartus has been infused, the infusion bag must be rinsed with 10 to 30 ml sodium 
 chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure as many cells as 
 possible are infused into the patient.</p><p>
 precations to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product 
 unused medicinal product and any waste material that has been in contact with tecartus (solid and 
 liquid waste) must be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local 
 guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material.</p><p>
 accidental exposure</p><p>in case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived material must be followed in case of accidental exposure, which may include washing of the contaminated skin, 
 removal of contaminated clothes. work surfaces and material which have potentially been in contact 
 with tecartus must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.</p><p>
