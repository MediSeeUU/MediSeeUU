 evaluating the safety and efficacy of kte-x19 in 
 subjects with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell 
 lymphoma (mcl). this submission is in fulfilment of 
 the specific obligation (sob 004) to confirm the long-

 the updated 24-month follow-up analyses of efficacy were 
 conducted using the modified intent to treat (mitt) 
 analysis set, which consisted of 68 patients treated with 
 tecartus. in the 24-month follow up analysis, the orr and 
 cr rates in the 68 patients in the mitt analysis set were 
 91% and 68% respectively.
