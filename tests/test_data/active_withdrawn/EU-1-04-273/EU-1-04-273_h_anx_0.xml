 adult patients treatment should be started with 2-3 g of lysodren per day. the total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient’s convenience. lysodren should be preferably taken during 
 meals (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 doses may be reduced to 1-2 g per day after two months of treatment (cumulative dose of 200 g) or in 
 case of toxicity.</p><p>
 if serious adverse reactions occur, such as neurotoxicity, treatment with mitotane may need to be 
 transiently interrupted. in case of mild toxicity, dosage should be reduced until the maximum tolerated 
 dosage is attained.</p><p>monitoring of plasma level, if available, may be considered. neurologic toxicity has been associated 
 with levels above 18-20 mg/l and, therefore, this threshold should not be reached. weaker evidence 
 has suggested that drug plasma levels above 14 mg/l may result in enhanced efficacy. in dose 
 readjustments, it should be taken into account that they do not produce immediate changes in plasma 
 levels of mitotane. in case that plasma monitoring is available, the starting dose of lysodren could be 
 as high as 4-6 g daily in divided doses until a cumulative dose of 75 g is reached (approximately in 15 
 days). thereafter, a monitoring schedule of once a month until a stable dosage is achieved is 
 reasonable (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 treatment with lysodren should be continued as long as clinical benefits are observed. if no clinical 
 benefits are observed after 3 months at optimal dose (based on empirical and/or drug monitoring 
 criteria) and if no toxicity is observed, dose escalation up to 6 g per day may be considered.</p><p>3paediatric patients the safety and efficacy of mitotane in patients under the age of 18 years have not been established and, at present only very limited data are available in this age group. 
 the paediatric dosage of mitotane has not been well characterised but appears equivalent to that of 
 adults: treatment should be initiated at 1.5 to 3.5 g/m
 2/day in children and adolescents and may be reduced after 2 or 3 months according to the plasma mitotane levels. doses should be reduced in case 
 of serious toxicity</p><p>as in adults (see above). 
 the total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient’s convenience. 
 lysodren should be preferably taken during meals.</p><p>liver impairment</p><p>since mitotane is mainly metabolised through the liver, mitotane plasma levels are expected to increase if liver function is impaired. there is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with 
 hepatic impairment, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further 
 data are available, the use of mitotane in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended 
 and, in cases of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised. monitoring of 
 plasma mitotane levels is specially recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 renal impairment there is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with renal impairment, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further data are available, the use of mitotane in 
 patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended and, in cases of mild to moderate renal 
 impairment, caution should be exercised. monitoring of plasma mitotane levels is specially 
 recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 elderly patients there is no experience on the use of mitotane in elderly patients, so data are insufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. until further data are available caution should be exercised and 
 frequent monitoring of plasma mitotane levels is highly recommended.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3  contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>
 breast-feeding is contra-indicated while taking mitotane. the prolonged elimination of mitotane from 
 the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be considered (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 lysodren and spironolactone must not be used concomitantly (see section 4.5).</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4  special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>before the initiation of the treatment: all possible tumour tissues should be surgically removed from large metastatic masses before mitotane administration is instituted. this is necessary to minimise the 
 possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane.</p><p>shock, severe trauma or infection: mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. exogenous 
 steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not 
 immediately start to secrete steroids. because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical 
 insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, 
 or other illness occurs. patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet 
 indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate 
 precautionary measures should be taken.</p><p>
 monitoring of plasma levels: monitoring of the plasma levels of mitotane may be used to guide lysodren dosing. it may be especially useful in cases where administration of higher starting doses is 
 considered necessary in order to reach earlier the desired therapeutic levels (e.g. highly symptomatic</p><p>4patients). the therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. a dose adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level and avoid specific adverse reactions. plasma 
 levels higher than 20 mg/l may be associated with severe undesirable effects and offer no further 
 benefit in terms of efficacy.</p><p>
 monitoring of plasma levels is particularly recommended in patients with liver impairment and/or 
 renal insufficiency (see section 4.2) for whom treatment with lysodren is considered necessary.</p><p>
 in patients with severe liver disease or severe renal impairment, there are insufficient data to support the use of mitotane (see section 4.2). in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and in 
 patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, caution should be exercised.</p><p>
 since mitotane is mainly stored in fat tissues, caution should be taken when treating overweight 
 patients as prolonged release of mitotane can occur.</p><p>
 central nervous system disorders: long-term continuous administration of high doses of mitotane may lead to reversible brain damage and impairment of function. behavioural and neurological 
 assessments should be made at regular intervals especially when plasma mitotane levels exceed 20 
 mg/l (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 risk of adrenal insufficiency: a substantial percentage of patients treated show signs of adrenal insufficiency. therefore steroid replacement may be necessary in these patients. since mitotane 
 increases plasma levels of steroid binding proteins, free cortisol and corticotropin (acth) 
 determinations are necessary for optimal dosing of steroid substitution (see section 4.8).</p><p>women of childbearing potential: women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with mitotane (see section 4.6).</p><p>
 bleeding time: prolonged bleeding time has been reported in patients treated with mitotane and this should be taken into account when surgery is considered (see section 4.8).</p><p>
 warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-like 
 anticoagulants (see section 4.5).</p><p>mitotane is a hepatic enzyme inducer and it should be used with caution in case of concomitant use of 
 medicinal products influenced by hepatic enzyme induction (see section 4.5). 
 paediatric population: in children, neuro-psychological retardation can be observed during mitotane treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid impairment linked to 
 mitotane treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5  interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>spironolactone: mitotane should not be given in combination with spironolactone since this drug may block the action of mitotane (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: mitotane has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of warfarin by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in 
 dosage requirements for warfarin. therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change 
 in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-like 
 anticoagulants.</p><p>
 substances metabolised through cytochrome p450: mitotane has been shown to have an inductive effect on cytochrome p450 enzymes. therefore the plasma concentrations of the products metabolised 
 via cytochrome p450</p><p>may be modified. in the absence of information on the specific p450 isoenzymes 
 involved, caution should be taken when coprescribing active substances metabolised by this route such</p><p>5as, among others, anticonvulsants, rifabutin, rifampicin, griseofulvin and st. john’s wort (hypericum perforatum
 ).</p><p>
 mitotane can give rise to central nervous system undesirable effects at high concentrations (see section 
 4.8). although no specific information on pharmacodynamic interactions in the central nervous system</p><p>
 is available, this should be borne in mind when coprescribing medicinal products with central nervous 
 system depressant action.</p><p>
 data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with food and/or oil enhance 
 absorption (see section 5.2).</p><p>
 mitotane has been shown to increase plasma hormone binding protein: this should be taken into 
 account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6  pregnancy and lactation 
  
 pregnancy</header><p>data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate adverse reactions of mitotane on the health of the foetus. animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane. animal studies 
 with similar substances have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). lysodren should be given 
 to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed and if the clinical benefit clearly outweighs any potential 
 risk to the foetus.</p><p>
 women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. 
 the prolonged elimination of mitotane from the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be 
 considered.</p></section><section><header>lactation</header><p>due to the lipophilic nature of mitotane, it is likely to be excreted in breast milk. breastfeeding is contra-indicated while taking mitotane (see section 4.3). a decision should be made whether to 
 discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue lysodren taking into account, on an individual basis, the 
 importance of the treatment to the mother. 
 the prolonged elimination of mitotane from the body after discontinuation of lysodren should be 
 considered.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7  effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>lysodren has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. since sedation, lethargy, vertigo, and other central nervous system undesirable effects can occur, ambulatory patients should be 
 cautioned about driving, operating machines, and other hazardous pursuits requiring mental and 
 physical alertness.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8  undesirable effects</header><p>more than 80 % of patients treated with mitotane have shown at least one type of undesirable effect. the main types of adverse reactions consist of the following:</p><p>6</p></section><section><header>undesirable effect (frequency) system organ class

 • gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequently reported (10 to 100 % of patients) and are reversible when the dose is reduced. some of these effects (anorexia) may constitute the hallmark of 
 initial central nervous system impairment.</p><p>7 • nervous system undesirable effects occur in approximately 40 % of the patients. other undesirable central nervous effects have been reported in literature such as memory defects, aggressiveness, 
 central vestibular syndrome, dysarthria, or parkinson syndrome. serious undesirable effects appear 
 linked to the cumulative exposure to mitotane and are most likely to occur when plasma mitotane 
 levels are at 20 mg/l or above. at high doses and after prolonged utilization, brain function impairment 
 can occur. nervous system undesirable effects appear reversible after cessation of mitotane treatment 
 and decrease in plasma levels (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 • metabolic disorders such as increases in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides are very common.</p><p> 
 • skin rashes which have been reported in 5 to 25 % of the cases do not seem to be dose related.</p><p>
 • leucopenia has been reported in 8 to 12 % of patients. prolonged bleeding time appears a frequent finding (90 percent of the cases): although the exact mechanism of such an effect is unknown and its 
 relation with mitotane or with the underlying disease is uncertain, it should be taken into account when 
 surgery is considered.</p><p>
 • the activity of liver enzymes (gamma-gt, aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) is commonly increased. autoimmune hepatitis has been reported in 7 % of patients with no other information on 
 mechanism. liver enzymes normalize when the mitotane dose is decreased.</p><p>
 • other isolated undesirable effects have been reported involving: the eye (visual impairment, maculopathy, vision blurred, diplopia, lens opacity, retinal toxicity); the renal and urinary system 
 (haematuria, haemorrhagic cystitis, proteinuria); cardiovascular system (hypertension, or orthostatic 
 hypotension, and flushing); and some miscellaneous effects including generalized aching; 
 hyperpyrexia; decreased plasma uric acid.</p><p>
 • because of its adrenolytic activity and its action on cortisol metabolism, mitotane treatment induces a state of functional adrenal insufficiency, which necessitates hormone supplementation. since 
 mitotane increases plasma level of steroid binding proteins, free cortisol and acth determinations are 
 necessary for optimal dosing of steroid substitution (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 in paediatric patients: nervous system disorders: neuro-psychological retardation may be observed during mitotane 
 treatment. in such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid 
 impairment linked to mitotane treatment. 
 hypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed during mitotane treatment.</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9  overdose</header><p>mitotane overdose may lead to central nervous system impairment especially if plasma mitotane levels are above 20 mg/l. no proven antidotes have been established for mitotane overdose. the patient 
 should be followed closely, taking into account that impairment is reversible but given the long half-
 life and the lipophilic nature of mitotane it may take weeks to return to normal. other effects should be 
 treated symptomatically. because of its lipophilic nature, mitotane is not likely to be dialysable.</p></section><section><header n="5">5.  pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: enzyme inhibitors. atc code: l02bg</p><p>
 mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic active substance, although it can cause adrenal inhibition, apparently 
 without cellular destruction. its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown. data are available to 
 suggest that mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing</p><p>8the adrenal cortex. the administration of mitotane alters the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol in man, leading to a reduction in measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroids, even though plasma levels of 
 corticosteroids do not fall. mitotane apparently causes increased formation of 6-beta-hydroxyl 
 cholesterol.</p><p>
 mitotane has not been studied in a clinical therapeutic program. available clinical information comes 
 mainly from published data in patients with inoperable or metastatic adrenal carcinoma. in terms of 
 overall survival, four studies conclude that mitotane treatment does not increase the survival rate 
 whereas five find an increase in the survival rate. among the latter, three studies find such an increase 
 only in patients in whom plasma mitotane is above 14 mg/l. in terms of total or partial tumour and/or 
 metastasis regression, eleven studies have shown some degree of improvement and sometimes 
 occasional prolonged remissions. however, in several studies, the objective criteria for evaluating 
 tumour response are missing or not reported. there are nevertheless some studies which provide 
 accurate information on tumour regression or disappearance and demonstrate that the threshold of 14 
 mg/l appears necessary to induce an objective tumour regression. in addition, mitotane induces a state 
 of adrenal insufficiency which leads to the disappearance of cushing syndrome in patients with 
 secreting adrenal carcinoma and necessitates substitution hormonotherapy.</p><p>paediatric population: clinical information comes mainly from a large retrospective trial in children (median age, 4 years) who had an unresectable primary tumour or who presented a tumour recurrence 
 or a metastasic disease; most of the children (75%) presented with endocrine symptoms. 
 mitotane was given alone or combined with chemotherapy with various agents. overall, the disease-
 free interval was 7 months (2 to 16 months). there were recurrences in 40% of children; the survival 
 rate at 5 years was 49%. 
 the observed undesirable effects were almost comparable to those in adults; however, neuro-
 psychological retardation, hypothyroidism and growth retardation can also be observed.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2  pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>in a study performed in patients with adrenal carcinoma treated with 2 to 3 g daily of mitotane, a highly significant correlation was found between plasma mitotane concentration and the total mitotane 
 dose. the target plasma mitotane concentration (14 mg/l) was reached in all patients within 3 to 5 
 months and the total lysodren dose ranged between 283 and 387 g x days of treatment (median value: 
 363 g x days of treatment). the threshold of 20 mg/l was reached for cumulative amounts of mitotane 
 of approximately 500 g. in another study, 3 patients with adrenal carcinoma received lysodren 
 according to a precise protocol allowing fast introduction of a high dose if the product was well 
 tolerated: 3 g (as 3 intakes) on day 1, 4.5 g on day 2, 6 g on day 3, 7.5 g on day 4 and 9 g on day 5. 
 this dose of lysodren was continued or decreased in function of side effects and plasma mitotane 
 levels. there was a positive linear correlation between the cumulative dose of lysodren and the 
 plasma levels of mitotane. in two of the 3 patients, plasma levels of more than 14 mg/l were achieved 
 within 15 days and in one of them levels above 20 mg/l were achieved within approximately 30 days. 
 in addition, in both studies, in some patients, the plasma mitotane levels continued to rise despite 
 maintenance or a decrease of the daily dose of mitotane.</p><p>
 administration of lysodren tablets with food increased absorption (see section 4.2), although no 
 quantitative measure of relative bioavailability was made.</p><p>
 autopsy data from patients show that mitotane is found in most tissues of the body, with fat as the 
 primary site of storage.</p><p>
 metabolism studies in man have identified the corresponding acid, 
 o,p’-dda, as the major circulating metabolite, together with smaller quantities of the 
 o,p’-dde analogue of mitotane. no unchanged mitotane has been found in bile or in urine, where 
 o,p’-dda predominates, together with several of its hydroxylated derivatives.</p><p>
 after intravenous administration, 25% of the dose was excreted as metabolite within 24 hours. 
 following discontinuation of mitotane treatment, it is slowly released from storage sites in fat, leading</p><p>9to reported terminal plasma half-lives ranging from 18 to 159 days.</p><p>
 for induction with cytochrome p450, see section 4.5.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3  preclinical safety data</header><p>preclinical data on the general toxicity of mitotane is limited. reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with mitotane. however, ddt and other polychlorinated biphenyl analogues are 
 recognised to have deleterious effects on fertility, pregnancy and development, and mitotane could be 
 expected to share these properties. the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of mitotane have not been 
 investigated.</p></section><section><header n="6">6.  pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1  list of excipients</header><p>maize starch</p><p>microcrystalline cellulose (e 460)
