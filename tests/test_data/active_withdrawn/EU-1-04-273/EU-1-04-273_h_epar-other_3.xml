 introduction</header><p>adrenal cortical carcinomas (acc) are highly malignant tumours with a very poor prognosis: a review from the memorial sloan-kettering cancer center (usa) from 1980 to 1991 indicated a mean survival 
 time of 9 months in patients whose tumours are unresectable. approximately 60% of patients have a 
 functional acc, defined by the existence of signs of excess adrenal hormone production. acc can be 
 found at any age but the incidence of tumours peaks in the first and fifth decade, especially in male 
 patients. there is an increased prevalence of acc in females (female to male ratio: 2.5), which is more 
 marked in patients with functional tumours. men with acc tend to be older than women.</p><p>
 whenever possible, curative surgery is the treatment of choice: after tumour resection, the mean 
 disease-free interval is 12 months with a wide range (1 to 175 months), with no difference between 
 patients with functional or non-functional tumours. the existence of a regional disease significantly 
 reduces the disease-free interval after surgery. in patients with recurrent disease, surgery should be 
 considered and should be performed if complete removal is feasible. if surgery is not possible and in 
 patients with metastatic disease, mitotane therapy is used either alone or associated with cytotoxic 
 chemotherapy.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 mitotane or o, p’- ddd (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane) is an isomer and a derivative of the insecticide ddt that acts blocking several steroidogenic enzymes with consequent 
 alteration of peripheral steroid metabolism, direct suppression of adrenal cortex and impact on 
 cortisone metabolism.</p><p>
 the approved indication of lysodren is as follows: 
 ‘‘symptomatic treatment of advanced (unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma 
 (acc). the effect of lysodren on non-functional adrenal cortical carcinoma is not established’’. 
 the recommended dose of lysodren is 2 to 3 g/day divided into two or three doses.</p><p>
 in this application, the mah of lysodren proposed to change the indication by removing the sentence 
 “the effect of lysodren on non-functional adrenal cortical carcinoma is not established’. further to the 
 assessment of the chmp and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the 
 indication was not considered approvable, the mah decided not to pursue the proposed change to the 
 indication. 
 however, the chmp agreed to the proposal from the mah to update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
 smpc based on the results of the firm-act study. the pl has been updated accordingly.</p><p>
 in addition, the mah took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives with croatia in the 
 package leaflet. 
 furthermore, the mah proposed this opportunity to bring the pi in line with the latest qrd template

 the clinical study report of the pk firm-act ancillary analysis (lys-001 study) and additional pharmacokinetics data further to 3 months of treatment have been submitted.</p><p>
 a subset of 40 firm act patients were enrolled in this study, but overall 32 patients were considered 
 for the primary pk analysis, 20 in the high dose regimen and 12 in the low dose regimen. the first 
 patient was enrolled on 15 june 2005 and the last one was enrolled on 22 february 2010. 
 results 
 according to the main results from pk firm-act study, the mean mitotane maximal plasma 
 concentrations and exposure were approximately 30% superior in the high-dose regimen (15.3 ± 7.5 
 mg/l) in comparison to the low-dose regimen (11.8 ± 4.7 mg/l), with a higher number of patients 
 treated with high dose mitotane reaching the effective plasma level (14 mg/l). however, the 
 difference was not statistically significant. 
 mean cumulated doses over the treatment period (12 weeks) were 60% higher in the high dose 
 regimen when compared to the low-dose regimen with mean values of 440±142 g in the high-dose 
 regimen versus 272±121 g in the low-dose regimen (p=0.013). 
 in both dose regimens, the median maximal plasma concentrations were reached after approximately 
 2.5 months and the steady state was not attained by the end of the study (day 82). 
 in the high dose regimen, half of patients (10/20) reached at least once mitotane plasma 
 concentrations above 14 mg/l after a median 46 days of treatment, while 4 out 12 patients in the low-
 dose regimen achieved this threshold with a median time of 55 days. 
 further to lys-001 study period (from day 82 to day 187), 7 out of 12 patients reached plasma 
 mitotane levels &gt;14 mg/l at least at one time point during follow-up from treatment initiation to day 
 187. among them 4 were in the initial high dose regimen group and the other 3 in the initial low dose 
 regimen group.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.3">2.3.3.  
 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>results from this study on pharmacokinetics had not been considered adequate to allow drawing any firm conclusion, as the mitotane steady-state has not been reached during the study period, and the 
 rate of patients in each regimen (high and low dose) able to achieve the therapeutic window was 
 unknown. 
 data from additional pk analysis after the 3 months of treatment considered in the csr of the lys-001 
 study were limited to information on the dose spontaneously reported by the investigator.</p><p>
 the available pk data do not affect the strategy of initiating treatment either with low or with high 
 dose and the need to regularly adjust the dose according to mitotane plasma levels and the clinical 
 tolerability, as already indicated in the smpc.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4.

 the lysodren dose regimen was left to the responsibility of the local investigator, with two possible dose regimens:</p><p>
 • the low starting dose approach (low-dose regimen): lysodren was administered at a starting dose of 
 1 g/day and increased stepwise every 3 days by 0.5 g up to a total dose of 4.0 g and then adjusted 
 according to plasma concentrations and tolerability.</p><p>
 • the high starting dose approach (high-dose regimen): lysodren was administered at a starting dose 
 of 1.5 g / day, then increased on day 2 to 3 g/ day, on day 3 to 4.5 g/day, and on day 4 to 6 g/day. 
 this latter dose was administered until the first mitotane plasma level was assayed. dose was then 
 adjusted according to plasma concentrations and tolerability.</p><p>
 in both treatment schedules, mitotane was started a minimum of 1 week before the initiation of the 
 cytotoxic treatment, with the aim to attain a blood level of 14 to 20 mg per litre.</p></section><section><header>objectives</header><p>the primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of the two randomised treatments. a secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between lysodren dose (daily and 
 cumulative) and mitotane plasma concentrations using one of two pre-defined treatment regimens 
 (high-dose and low-dose).</p><p>
 the secondary objectives also included the evaluation of the impact of lysodren treatment on certain 
 hormonal parameters and the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of lysodren treatment.</p><p>
 the main focus of this report is on the secondary objectives.</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>the primary endpoint for the firm act study was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, tumour response and quality of life.</p></section><section><header>sample size and statistical considerations</header><p>the target sample size was 300 patients. the trial was designed to have a power of 80% to detect a risk reduction of 33% in the edp–mitotane group, as compared with the streptozocin–mitotane group.

 fifteen out of 55 patients 
 (27.3%) achieved an objective

 median os was 1 year (18 
 days-11 year). the mitotane 
 level during the response was 
 available for 39 patients, 
 including 32 who reached a 
 mitotane level ≥ 14 mg/l. 
 median os was 13.3 and 4.0 
 months respectively in pts who 
 received mitotane therapy as a 
 single first-line or not. 
 median os was 19.6 and 9.5 
 months for pts with a mitotane 
 level ≥14 mg/l and &lt;14 mg/l, 
 respectively.

 a powerful 
 prognostic factor in

 the strategy to start 
 mitotane as first line 
 therapy may confer 
 a greater chance to 
 rapidly achieve 
 therapeutic plasma

 data on acc patients

 median mitotane plasma level 
 was 12.7 mg/l in the total 
 population, 16.3 mg/l in the 
 responders subgroup, 11.6 
 mg/l in patients with sd and 
 11 mg/l for non-responders 
 (p=0.03). 
 using the roc curve analysis, 
 the cut-off level of 14 mg/l 
 resulted in 65% sensitivity and 
 69% specificity. cut off values 
 of 16, 18, and 20 mg/l were 
 associated with a lower 
 sensitivity but a higher 
 specificity. 
 survival from time to first 
 mitotane dose was 
 significantly longer for patients 
 achieving the ≥14 mg/l 
 threshold (hr 0.52, 0.28-0.97,

 the 14 mg/l

 mitotane plasma levels and the possible relationship with its efficacy were studied in the firm act 
 trial, a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group study to compare 
 the efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatine plus mitotane (edp/m) to that of streptozotocin 
 plus mitotane (sz/m) as first-line treatment in 304 patients. the analysis of patients who achieved 
 mitotane levels ≥ 14mg/l at least once in six months versus patients who mitotane levels were &lt; 14 
 mg/l could suggest that patients with mitotane plasma levels ≥ 14mg/l could have an improvement in 
 disease control rate (62.9% versus 33.5%; p&lt;0.0001). however, this result should be cautiously 
 taken since the examination of the mitotane effects was not the primary endpoint of the study (see 
 smpc sections 4.2 and 5.1).</p><p>
 consistently with these results, in a retrospective review recently published (hermsen, 2011), the 
 median mitotane plasma level was 16.3 mg/l in the responders subgroup, 11.6 mg/l in patients with 
 sd and 11 mg/l for non-responders (p=0.03). 
 both in the firm act study and in the hermsen review, patients with functional as well as non-
 functional acc were included. 
 even though in the firm act study 51.3 % of not symptomatic patients (77 out of the 138) seemed to 
 have mitotane plasma level ≥14 mg/l at least once during the first 6 months, data on disease control 
 reported in this specific patient population have not been provided.</p><p>results of subgroup analyses in 
 patients with non-functional tumours enrolled in both treatment arms in the firm act trial have not 
 been provided. in addition, taking into account that the firm-act was designed to compare the 
 efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin plus mitotane (edp/m) to that of streptozotocin plus 
 mitotane (sz/m) as first-line treatment, the chmp considered that based on the results of the firm-
 act study, the efficacy of mitotane in the treatment of patients with non-functional adrenal cortical 
 carcinoma, cannot be defined since both arms of the trial included mitotane in combination.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.

 five spontaneous reports were identified from the above search coincident with the use of lysodren. one was serious and four were considered as non-serious; all the reports were medically confirmed. 
 one case refers to a child patient. outcomes were reported as recovering in two reports, as recovered 
 in one report and as not recovered in the two remaining reports.</p><p>
 the literature report involves a 4-year-old patient with precocious puberty who took mitotane as 
 adjuvant chemotherapy for left androgen-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma. the adrenocortical 
 tumour with focal necrosis and haemorrhage was totally removed. mitotane therapy was started with 
 0.5g/day and the dose was increased gradually by 0.5g/day during 1-2 weeks while monitoring the 
 plasma level, up to 5.0g/day (plasma level, 13.43 μg/ml 3 months after initiation). the patient&apos;s 
 concomitant medication included leuprorelin acetate. five months after initiation of mitotane, the 
 patient experienced an encephalopathy (anorexia, balance disorder, gait disturbance, speech disorder, 
 apathy, memory impairment, quadriplegia, ataxia, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, 
 electroencephalogram abnormal) considered as due to the increased level of mitotane (34.55 μg/ml, 6 
 months after mitotane initiation). mitotane was discontinued and a high dose of hydrocortisone was 
 administered for adrenal crisis. the plasma mitotane level gradually decreased, and the neurological 
 symptoms improved. it took 6 months for the mitotane to disappear from the plasma and for clinical 
 recovery of the encephalopathy. no signs of tumour recurrence have been observed for 3 years since 
 discontinuation of mitotane. all neurological abnormalities found after initiation of mitotane, including 
 memory disturbance and motor disability, were no longer present.</p><p>according to the author, there has 
 been limited use of mitotane in children and its use remains to be established. several side effects of 
 mitotane are known, especially due to its narrow therapeutic range. a mitotane level of more than 20 
 mg/l is associated with neurological toxicity. in this patient, encephalopathy appeared after 5 months 
 despite monthly monitoring of the plasma level after determination of the dose. this might have been 
 caused by gradual accumulation of lipid-soluble mitotane after the determination of the therapeutic 
 dose. the mitotane assay is not performed regularly for clinical use; in fact it took 1-2 weeks to obtain 
 the mitotane level data and the encephalopathy developed before he noticed the high level of 
 mitotane. a temporal relationship and a positive dechallenge were reported for all the events including 
 balance disorders, therefore the causal relationship is possible.</p><p>

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the following treatment-related aes were reported in the firm act study: dyspepsia, dysgeusia, oesophagitis, balance disorder and clonus. since these events are considered as unexpected according 
 to the current smpc of lysodren, an additional analysis was performed for each of these adverse 
 events collected in the mah’s global database through the spontaneous reporting.</p><p>
 regarding dysgeusia in all the reported cases there was a reasonable time sequence between lysodren 
 intake and dysgeusia, with a positive dechallenge in two of them. the causal relationship of lysodren 
 can be assessed as possible. dysgeusia was added to section 4.8 of the smpc. in addition, and based 
 on the absence of recovery, this adverse reaction will be reviewed at the next psur planned in 2014 
 (29 april 2011-28 april 2014).</p><p>
 based on the available data in the cases of dyspepsia and, due to a temporal association a causal role 
 for lysodren cannot be excluded. section 4.8 of the smpc has been updated to include dyspepsia as 
 an adverse reaction with not known frequency.</p><p>
 considering that no oesophagitis cases have been retrieved in the mah’s pharmacovigilance database, 
 the chmp agreed to review this adverse reaction in the next psur. 
 in all (5) the cases of balance disorders there is a reasonable time sequence with lysodren intake. in 4 
 of these cases the event of balance disorder is reported in a context of mitotane plasma level above of 
 the therapeutic window (&gt; 20 mg/l in 3 reports) and a positive dechallenge reported in two of them. 
 in addition, and based on the absence of recovery, this adverse reaction will be reviewed at the next 
 psur. 
 one case of encephalopathy has been observed in a paediatric patient five months after initiation of 
 the treatment; this case was considered to be related to an increased mitotane plasma level of 34.5 
 mg/l. after six months mitotane plasma levels were undetectable and the patient recovered clinically. 
 the smpc has been updated to include this information. 
 no follow up information is available of the clonus hcp spontaneous case. follow-up information will be
