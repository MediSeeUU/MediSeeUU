 introduction</header><p>sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the bcr-abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c-kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and 
 pdgfβ receptor. the marketing authorisation (ma) was granted in november 2006 for the treatment 
 of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesylate, and also for the treatment of adults with 
 philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) and lymphoid blast 
 cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.</p><p>
 at the time of the chmp opinion for the initial marketing authorisation in september 2006, the 
 marketing authorisation holder (mah) made a commitment (fum 010) to provide data post-
 authorisation from two phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib administered 
 once daily (qd) versus twice daily (bid) in subjects with chronic (ca180034) and advanced phase 
 cml or ph+ all (ca180035).</p><p>
  fum 010:</p><p>&apos;the proposed posology should be reassessed when results of studies ca180034 and ca 180035 are available. final clinical study report (24 months follow-up) by june 
 2009
 .’</p><p> 
 6 months data from these studies have previously been evaluated as a part of variation 
 emea/h/c/709/ii/02 for which a positive chmp opinion was adopted in july 2007, recommending 
 the approval of a change in posology for chronic phase cml to 100 mg qd as starting dose, due to a 
 more favourable benefit/risk ratio than the 70 mg bid originally approved.</p><p>the mah has now submitted a type ii variation application to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 
 5.1 of the spc with 24-months follow-up data from the phase iii studies ca180034 and ca180035. 
 the package leaflet has beeen amended accordingly.</p><p>
 in addition, the mah has taken the opportunity to provide an updated version of the rmp (version 
 6.0). consequently, annex ii has been updated to reflect the latest version agreed with the chmp.</p></section><section><header>clinical aspects  clinical pharmacology</header><p>no additional studies on biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology have been submitted as part of this application.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>this application is based upon two phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib administered once daily (qd) versus twice daily (bid) (current posology for the advanced phase cml 
 and ph+ all indications) in subjects with chronic phase cml (ca180034) and advanced phase cml 
 or ph+ all (ca180035).</p></section><section><header>studies ca180034 and ca180035</header><p>in the</p></section><section><header>phase 3 study (ca180034)</header><p> in subjects with chronic phase cml, dasatinib was administered qd or bid at a total daily dose (tdd) of 100 mg or 140 mg. the primary endpoint was the 
 comparison of mcyr rates after a minimum follow-up of 6 months of dasatinib treatment when 
 administered qd relative to bid in imatinib-resistant subjects. secondary endpoints included: 
 comparison of mcyr rates between the 2 tdds of dasatinib; durability and time to mcyr; rate, 
 duration, time to chr; and major molecular response (mmr). six hundred seventy subjects were 
 2 randomized (497 imatinib-resistant, according to the assessment on the baseline case report form, and 173 imatinib-intolerant) to receive dasatinib at either 100 mg or 140 mg tdd.</p><p>
 in the</p></section><section><header>phase 3 study (ca180035)</header><p> in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all, dasatinib was administered either qd or bid at a tdd of 140 mg. the primary endpoint was the comparison of 
 mahr rates in all randomized subjects treated with dasatinib at 140 mg qd or 70 mg bid. secondary 
 endpoints included durability and time to mahr and rate of mcyr. six hundred eleven subjects with 
 accelerated phase, myeloid blast phase, or lymphoid blast phase cml or with ph+ all were 
 randomized to receive dasatinib at either 140 mg qd or 70 mg bid.</p><p>
 in both studies, investigators were allowed to escalate subjects’ doses to achieve better efficacy or to 
 reduce subjects’ doses to manage adverse events. efficacy responses were determined from 
 haematologic values, bone marrow cytology and cytogenetics, and in the presence or absence of 
 extramedullary disease. all data presented represent data collected from any subject who was 
 randomized. response rates were estimated along with their 95% exact cis based on the clopper-
 pearson method. kaplan-meier estimates of median duration of response were provided along with 
 their 95% cis. duration on treatment is calculated as the time from the first dose to the last dose of 
 study drug; medians are presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects treated 
 in the studies. in addition, duration of response is presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-
 intolerant subjects.</p><p>
 mmr in subjects with chronic phase cml was assessed by rq-pcr determined as the ratio of bcr-
 abl copies to a control gene. these ratios were expressed using a standardized methodology initially 
 described in the international randomized study of interferon and sti-571 (iris) trial and currently 
 reported by an international panel of experts. data are reported on the international scale after 
 determining a laboratory specific conversion factor. molecular data for the phase 3 study (ca180034) 
 were measured internally at a bms facility using validated methodology. results are reported in all 
 treated subjects and in subjects who achieved a ccyr. subjects assessed for mmr may have been 
 tested at any time during the treatment period.</p><p>
 progression-free survival (pfs) was defined as the time from randomization until the time disease 
 progression was first documented by the investigator or death. subjects who neither progressed nor 
 died were censored on the date of their last cytogenetic or haematologic assessment.</p></section><section><header>results study ca180034</header><p>the median duration of exposure in ca180034 was 22 months.</p><p>efficacy was achieved across all treatment groups with the qd schedule demonstrating comparable 
 efficacy (non-inferiority) to the bid schedule on the primary efficacy endpoint (difference in mcyr 
 1.9%; 95% confidence interval [-6.8%–10.6%]). over half of the subjects with chronic phase cml 
 who achieved mcyr did so within the first 6 months with most subjects achieving mcyr by 1 year. 
 mmr in all treated subjects was reported in 33% to 35% of the subjects. mmr in assessed subjects 
 with ccyr was reported in 66% to 72% of the subjects. rates of projected duration of mcyr and 
 ccyr, projected pfs, and projected overall survival showed little difference across dose and 
 schedule. similar findings were reported for subjects who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib. 
 (please refer to table 4.3.1.2 below)</p><p>
 3</p><p> 4</p><p> in imatinib-intolerant subjects who received 100 mg qd, mcyr was achieved in 77%, ccyr in 67%, and mmr (in assessed subjects with ccyr) in 64%. based on the kaplan-meier estimates, all 
 subjects (100%) maintained mcyr for 1 year and 92% (95% ci: [80%–100%]) maintained mcyr for 
 18 months. the estimated rate of pfs in this population was 97% (95% ci: [92%–100%]) at 1 year 
 and 87% (95% ci: [76%–99%]) at 2 years. the estimated rate of overall survival was 100% at 1 year 
 and 95% (95% ci: [88%–100%]) at 2 years.</p></section><section><header>results study ca180035</header><p>with 2 years of follow-up in subjects with advanced phase cml and ph+ all in the phase 3 study (ca180035), haematologic and cytogenetic responses were achieved in subjects treated with 
 dasatinib. data from ca180035 establishing the optimal dosing schedule showed similar efficacy 
 between the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid schedules. with both schedules, long-term responses were 
 identified in advanced phases of disease.</p><p>
 5</p><p> accelerated phase cml: with 2 years of follow-up, most subjects with accelerated phase cml achieved haematologic 
 responses. efficacy results were similar between the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid. cytogenetic 
 response rates in ca180035 were lower than haematologic responses (see table 4.3.3.2 below). most 
 subjects who achieved mahr did so within the first 6 months of treatment.10 rates of projected 
 duration of mahr, projected pfs, and projected overall survival were high and showed little 
 difference between the 2 schedules.</p><p>
 myeloid blast phase cml: 
 efficacy results with 2 years of follow-up were similar between the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid 
 schedules. in ca180035, approximately one-third of the subjects achieved haematologic and 
 cytogenetic responses (see table 4.3.3.2 below). in subjects with mahr, the time to response was 
 rapid and within the first 4 months of treatment. rates of projected duration of mahr, projected pfs, 
 and projected overall survival showed little difference across the 2 schedules.</p><p>
 lymphoid blast phase cml: 
 there was little difference in efficacy between the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid schedules in subjects 
 with lymphoid blast phase cml after 2 years of follow-up. in ca180035, more subjects achieved a 
 mcyr compared with mahr (table 4.3.3.2). most subjects who achieved mahr did so within the 
 first 2 months of treatment.10 rates of projected duration of mahr, projected pfs, and projected 
 overall survival were lower compared with other advanced phases of cml reflecting the more 
 aggressive nature of this disease phase.</p><p>
 ph+ all: 
 in subjects with ph+ all with 2 years of follow-up, rates of mahr were similar between the 140 mg 
 qd and 70 mg bid schedules. in ca180035, cytogenetic responses were greater than haematologic 
 6 responses (see table 4.3.3.3 below). most subjects who achieved mahr did so within the first 2 months of treatment. rates of projected duration of mahr, projected pfs, and projected overall 
 survival were lower compared with other advanced phases of cml reflecting the more aggressive 
 nature of this disease phase</p><p>
 dose modifications</p><p>
 study ca180035 included 609 patients. among the 304 patients who were randomized to the 140 mg 
 qd starting dose of dasatinib, 110 (36%) were dose escalated (table 1). of the 110 subjects who dose 
 escalated, 106 (96%) escalated to 180 mg, 3 to 200 mg, and 1 to 280 mg. escalation higher than 180 
 mg qd was primarily due to dosing error or rising % blasts.</p></section><section><header>table 1:   dose modifications: all treated

 of the 110 subjects who dose escalated to 
  180 mg qd due to either no response or partial response at the recommended starting dose, haematologic responses were reported in 10 subjects. of the 10 
 subjects with haematologic response after dose escalation, 4 achieved a major haematologic response 
 (mahr). cytogenetic responses were reported in 18 subjects who dose escalated due to no response or 
 partial response at the recommended starting dose. an additional 7 subjects who had a loss of mcyr 
 regained mcyr after dose escalation. of these 25 subjects with a cytogenetic response after dose 
 escalation, 17 achieved mcyr. overall, with 3 of the 4 subjects with a mahr also achieving a mcyr, 
 a total of 18 (16%) out of 110 subjects benefited from dose escalation 
  180 mg qd. changes in response following dose escalation are presented in table 2.</p></section><section><header>table 2: hematologic and cytogenetic responses to dose escalation</header><p>pre-escalation response post-escalation

 therefore, 18 unique subjects achieved benefit from dose escalation.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>the current dosing recommendation is 70 mg bid in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all based on three phase 2 studies and one phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. with 
 long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (ca180035), efficacy data were similar between 
 the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 
 70 mg bid. with both schedules, long-lasting responses were identified. in subjects with ph+ all 
 with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg 
 qd and 70 mg bid schedules. the dose of 140 mg qd supports an overall superior benefit risk and 
 should be recommended in this population.</p><p>
 dose-escalation to 180 mg qd in subjects with no response or partial response at the recommended 
 starting dose is considered justified based on dose modification guidelines utilized in study ca180035 
 that resulted in response improvement without additional safety concerns.</p><p>
 protocol ca180035 allowed dose escalation from 140 mg to 180 mg total daily dose for the advanced 
 phase cml and ph+ all patients for the following reasons: 
  rising % blasts on 2 consecutive haematologic assessments at least one week apart (i.e., from day 15); 
  no complete haematologic response (chr), no evidence of leukaemia (nel), or minor haematologic response (mihr) within 4 weeks;</p><p>
  no major cytogenetic response (mcyr) after 3 months;</p><p> no complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) after 6 months;</p><p> loss of haematologic response on 2 consecutive assessments at least 1 week apart.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>as part of this submission safety data are presented for the safety cohort (all treated subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug). the safety prognosis for subjects resistant and intolerant to 
 imatinib was expected to be similar; therefore, all of the safety analyses combined these 2 groups 
 except for subgroup analyses by imatinib status.</p><p>
 safety data are presented separately for subjects with chronic phase cml and advanced phase cml or 
 ph+ all. in subjects with chronic phase cml, data are displayed by 100 mg qd, 70 mg bid, other 
 doses, and all doses. in advanced phase cml and in ph+ all, data are presented for 140 mg qd, 70 
 mg bid, and total. 
 8</p></section><section><header>exposure</header><p>dasatinib-treated subjects with cml or ph+ all were followed for 2 years. in ca180034, the median duration of study therapy was similar across the 4 treatment schedules (22 months for each 
 schedule).</p><p>in ca180035, the median duration of study therapy was similar between the qd (6.1 
 months; range 0.03 - 31.2 months) and bid (6.2 months; range 0.03 - 28.8 months) groups. likewise, 
 there was little difference between the groups in median duration when excluding interruptions (5.7 
 months and 5.2 months, respectively). the median duration of exposure in the overall population of 
 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects with cml or ph+ all was 15.01 months; 55% of the subjects were 
 administered dasatinib for more than 12 months.</p></section><section><header>common drug-related adverse events</header><p>in study ca180034 with 2 years of follow-up, the majority of treated subjects (645 [97%]) reported at least 1 ae, regardless of relationship to study drug. 9 drug-related aes were reported in 603 (91%) 
 subjects. drug-related aes occurred less frequently in the 100 mg qd group (86%) compared with the 
 other 3 treatment groups (range 92% to 94%). similarly, drug-related grade 3 to 5 aes also occurred 
 less frequently in the 100 mg qd group (36%) compared with the 140 mg qd, 50 mg bid, and 70 mg 
 bid groups (range 42% to 53%). common drug-related non-haematologic aes (occurring ≥ 20% in at 
 least 1 treatment group) were headache (23% to 32%), diarrhoea (26% to 31%), nausea (18% to 29%), 
 fatigue (19% to 25%), dyspnoea (16% to 23%), and pleural effusion (14% to 25%).</p><p>
 in ca180035, most subjects in both the qd group and the bid group reported at least 1 ae, any 
 grade, while on study drug (98% vs. 99%).10 drug-related aes (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects), were 
 reported in the majority of subjects (90% in qd and 89% in bid). drug-related aes were similar 
 between the qd and bid groups with 2 exceptions: pleural effusion (20% vs. 32%, respectively) and 
 peripheral oedema (9% vs. 15%, respectively).</p><p>
 of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, 1,864 (85%) experienced at least 1 drug-
 related ae over the course of the study. adrs of clinical relevance included diarrhoea (33%), pleural 
 effusion (27%), headache (25%), haemorrhage (16%), and infection (11%).</p><p>
 two tables of selected adverse drug reactions (adrs) reported in these phase 3 dose-optimization 
 studies have been updated in the proposed spc. uncommon and rare adverse drug reactions are also 
 discussed and updated in the proposed spc section 4.8.</p></section><section><header>drug-related adverse events leading to discontinuation</header><p>in ca180034, 101 (15%) subjects reported aes leading to discontinuation, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. eighty-three (13%) subjects reported 
 drug-related aes leading to discontinuation. fewer subjects in the 100 mg qd group (8%) reported 
 drug-related aes leading to discontinuation, any grade, compared with the 140 mg qd, 50 mg bid, 
 and 70 mg bid groups (12% to 15%, respectively). the most common (≥ 2% incidence in at least 1 
 treatment group) drug-related aes leading to discontinuation were pleural effusion, dyspnoea, and 
 headache. drug-related aes leading to discontinuation, for all grades and for grade 3 to 5, were less 
 frequent in the 100 mg qd group vs. the other 3 treatment groups. this difference was largely due to 
 fewer subjects with pleural effusion leading to discontinuation in the 100 mg qd group.</p><p>
 in ca180035, 192 (32%) subjects reported aes leading to discontinuation, any grade, during the 
 study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. drug-related aes leading to 
 discontinuation of study therapy were similar between the qd and bid groups (14% and 16%, 
 respectively) with the exception of drug-related pleural effusion (2% vs. 5%, respectively). the most 
 common (≥ 2% incidence in at least 1 treatment group) drug-related ae leading to discontinuation 
 was pleural effusion.</p><p>9</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events</header><p>in ca180034, 276 (42%) subjects reported saes, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. one hundred seventy-four (26%) subjects reported drug-related 
 saes. fewer subjects in the 100 mg qd group (19%) reported drug-related saes vs. the 140 mg qd, 
 50 mg bid, and 70 mg bid groups (25% to 33%). in particular, pleural effusion, gastrointestinal 
 disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and cardiac disorders were less frequent in the 100 
 mg qd group than in the other 3 treatment groups. similarly, severe (grade 3 to 5) drug-related saes 
 were less frequent in the 100 mg qd group (13%) than in the other 3 treatment groups (16% to 25%). 
 the most common (&gt; 3% incidence in at least 1 treatment group) severe drug-related saes were 
 pleural effusion, dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.</p><p>
 in ca180035, 448 (74%) subjects reported saes, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after 
 the last dose of study medication. two hundred seventy (44%) subjects reported drug-related saes. 
 there was little difference (43% vs. 46%, respectively) in drug-related saes between the qd and bid 
 groups. notable common (&gt;3% incidence in at least 1 treatment group) drug-related saes were 
 pleural effusion, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, 
 thrombocytopenia, and anaemia.</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>in ca180034, 65 deaths were reported of which 26 were due to disease progression. two of the 65 deaths were due to study drug toxicity (1 pulmonary oedema/chf/neck pain/pleural effusion, 1 
 necrosis of the colon). both deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. of the 65 
 deaths, 16 occurred on-study or within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. of these 16, deaths were 
 less frequent in the qd group compared with the bid group (5 vs. 11 subjects, respectively).</p><p>
 in ca180035, 321 out of 609 subjects died of which over half were due to disease progression. of the 
 321 deaths, 126 subjects died on-study or within 30 days of last dose of study therapy. for those 
 deaths within 30 days of last dose of study therapy, a difference between the qd and bid groups was 
 observed in infection (17% vs. 30%, respectively) and cardiovascular disease (3% vs. 11%, 
 respectively).</p></section><section><header>laboratory abnormalities</header><p>in this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe (grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. there were few clinically meaningful 
 non-haematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on treatment with dasatinib with 2 years 
 of follow-up, a result consistent with the initial filing. in ca180034 and ca180035, there were 
 minimal differences between the treatment groups in the number of subjects with grade 3 or 4 liver 
 function and renal function abnormalities. in addition, electrolytes changes and coagulation 
 parameters were similar between the groups in the two phase 3 studies. there were few instances of 
 grade 3 or 4 laboratory values; the most common laboratory abnormality was grade 3 or 4 
 hypophosphataemia.</p><p>
 an updated section of laboratory test abnormalities is provided in section 4.8 of the proposed spc.</p></section><section><header>selected safety events</header><p>safety issues of special importance in the dasatinib product information included the aes of myelosuppression, fluid retention, bleeding-related events, and qt prolongation.</p><p>
 haematology</p><p>
 with 2 years of follow-up, the occurrence of severe leukopaenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
 anaemia were more frequent in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all than in chronic phase 
 10 cml. in subjects who reported severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief (2 to 4 weeks) dose interruptions or reductions. 
 in ca180034, cytopenia was reported less frequently in the 100 mg qd group than in the other 3 
 treatment groups. more subjects in the 100 mg qd and 70 mg bid groups (55% and 54%, 
 respectively) than in the 140 mg qd and 50 mg bid groups (40% and 36%, respectively) had their 
 first occurrences of leukocytopenia after 8 weeks of treatment. in ca180035, more subjects in the 
 bid group reported neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared with the qd group. there was little 
 difference between the qd and bid groups in the time to first occurrence of grade 3 to 4 wbc, 
 platelet, and anc.</p><p>
 fluid retention</p><p>
 dasatinib is associated with fluid retention. fluid retention events were systematically identified in the 
 dasatinib programme. other events related to fluid retention were also examined including: 1) pleural 
 effusion, 2) ascites, 3) pulmonary oedema, 4) congestive heart failure (chf), 5) pulmonary 
 hypertension, and 6) pericardial effusion.</p><p>
 in ca180034, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 264 (40%) subjects. of these 264 subjects, 
 drug-related fluid retention occurred in 238 (36%) subjects. pleural effusion, any grade and any 
 relationship, was reported in 147 (22%) subjects. few subjects reported severe (grade 3 to 5) pleural 
 effusions. the majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (96%; 141/147). fewer subjects 
 in the 100 mg qd group reported pleural effusion (all grades) compared with the 140 mg qd, 50 mg 
 bid, and 70 mg bid groups (14% vs. 25%, 23%, and 23%, respectively). the number of subjects 
 with drug-related fluid-related events (including generalized oedema, pulmonary oedema, 
 chf/cardiac dysfunction, and pericardial effusion) was generally lower in the 100 mg qd group 
 compared with the other 3 treatment groups.</p><p>
 in ca180035, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 281 (46%) subjects. of these 281 subjects, 
 drug-related fluid retention occurred in 227 (37%) subjects. pleural effusion, any grade and any 
 relationship, was reported in 181 (30%) subjects. few subjects reported severe (grade 3 to 5) pleural 
 effusions. the majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (88%; 159/181) (table 5.5.2b). 
 fewer subjects in the qd group reported drug-related pleural effusion compared with the bid group 
 (20% vs. 32%, respectively). the number of subjects with drug-related fluid-related events (including 
 generalized oedema, pulmonary oedema, chf/cardiac dysfunction, and pericardial effusion) was 
 lower in the qd group compared with bid group.</p><p>
 bleeding-related events</p><p>
 in ca180034, gastrointestinal bleeding, any grade, was reported in 40 subjects. drug-related 
 gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 21 subjects. there was little difference in the rate of 
 gastrointestinal bleeding between the 4 treatment groups.</p><p>
 in ca180035, drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding, any grade, was reported in 63 subjects. 10 fewer 
 subjects in the qd group (n = 25) compared with the bid group (n = 38) reported drug-related 
 gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>
 qt prolongation</p><p>
 a comprehensive evaluation of data from phase 2 studies (n = 865) examined the possible effect of 
 dasatinib on ecg parameters, particularly the qtc interval. the mean qtc interval changes from 
 baseline using fridericia’s method (qtcf) were 4 to 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence intervals for 
 all mean changes from baseline were &lt; 7 msec. a total of 5 subjects (&lt; 1%) reported a qtcf &gt; 500 
 msec; 1 of these 5 subjects reported a qtcf &gt; 500 msec on both days 1 and 8. no events of torsade de 
 pointes were reported.</p><p>
 nine of the 1150 subjects with chronic phase cml had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse 
 event. of these 9 subjects, 7 were considered related to drug. none of the 9 subjects who reported qtc 
 prolongation were from the 100 mg qd group compared with 8 subjects from the 70 mg bid group. 
 11 ten of the 1032 subjects with advanced disease had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse event. of these 10 subjects, 7 were considered drug-related. all 10 of the subjects who reported qtc 
 prolongation were from the 70 mg bid group.</p><p>
 overall, of the 2182 subjects treated with dasatinib in clinical trials, 21 (1%) subjects across the 
 studies reported a qtcf &gt; 500 msec, and 14 (&lt;1%) had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse 
 reaction. these data have been updated in the proposed spc, accordingly (sections 4.4 and 4.8).</p></section><section><header>dose modifications</header><p>analysis of safety showed no meaningful differences in subjects (advanced phase cml or ph+ all) with dose escalation (

 are acceptable.</p><p>
 chmp’s comment: 
 the changes to the product information are supported by the data submitted and provide further useful 
 information to the treating physicians.</p></section><section><header>benefit /risk assessment</header><p>this type ii variation concerns an update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the spc with 24-months follow-up data from two phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 
 administered once daily (qd) versus twice daily (bid) (current posology for the advanced phase cml 
 and ph+ all indications) in subjects with chronic phase cml (ca180034) and advanced phase cml 
 or ph+ all (ca180035).</p><p> 
 the current dosing recommendation is 70 mg bid in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all 
 based on three phase 2 studies and one phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. with 
 long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (ca180035), efficacy data were similar between 
 the 140 mg qd and 70 mg bid schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 
 70 mg bid. with both schedules, long-lasting responses were identified. in subjects with ph+ all 
 with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg 
 qd and 70 mg bid schedules. the dose of 140 mg qd supports an overall superior benefit risk and 
 should be recommended in this population of advanced phase cml and ph+ all.</p><p>
 safety results after 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the safety profile reported with shorter 
 follow-up. in chronic phase cml, fewer subjects in the 100 mg qd group reported drug-related non-
 haematologic toxicities, all grades, than subjects in the 70 mg bid. aes of special interest including 
 fluid retention, haemorrhage, and some cardiac disorders were reported in fewer subjects in the 100 
 mg qd group compared with the 70 mg bid group. similarly, in subjects with advanced phase cml 
 or ph+ all, the qd schedule of administration was also associated with fewer drug-related non-
 haematologic toxicities (including aes of special interest). myelosuppression usually occurred early, 
 especially in advanced stages of cml. incidence and severity did not change over time.</p><p>
 overall, data presented in the dossier confirm the selection of 140 mg qd as the recommended 
 starting dose in subjects with advanced cml and ph+ all. the proposed revised spc section 4.2 
 also includes a revised dose modification guideline:</p><p>
 -</p><p>for dose escalation: in patients who did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the 
 recommended starting dosage; 
 - for dose adjustments for undesirable effects: with guidance including interruption, reduction, and 
 escalation. 
 16 17 based on the analyses provided the chmp considers the dose escalation recommendation justified, as there is a subgroup of patients who derive efficacy benefit with the dose escalation to 180 mg qd. in 
 addition, few differences in the safety profile were reported in subjects with dose escalation thereby 
 demonstrating that the benefit in response received with dose escalation is not compromised by 
 additional safety risks.</p><p>
 the chmp consider the proposed changes to the spc and the package leaflet acceptable. in addition, 
 the mah took the opportunity to provide an updated version of the rmp (version 6.0). the revisions 
 introduced in the rmp are relevant and fully adequate.</p><p>consequently, annex ii has been updated to 
 reflect the latest version agreed with the chmp.</p></section><section><header>conclusion</header><p>on 22 january 2009 the chmp considered this type ii variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics, annex ii and package 
 leaflet.</p></section></body></xml>
