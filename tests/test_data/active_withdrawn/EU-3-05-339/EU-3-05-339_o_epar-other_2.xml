 dasatinib (sprycel) added to successive blocks of standard multiagent chemotherapy (aieop-bfm all 
 2000 regimen) for a maximum duration of 2 years. subjects began frontline induction chemotherapy 
 (block ia) prior to enrollment in this study based upon the investigator’s institutional standard of care. 
 subjects with confirmed ph+ all were enrolled in the study, and at day 15 dasatinib treatment began 
 and continued without planned interruption until the completion of therapy (102 weeks). initially, at 
 least 75 pediatric patients (&gt; 1 year and &lt; 18 years old) were planned to be treated with dasatinib and 
 evaluable for the primary endpoint, including at least 20 pediatric subjects evaluable for the primary 
 endpoint in each of the following age ranges: 1 to less than 12 years and 12 to less than 18 years.</p><p>
 dasatinib was orally delivered as a tablet, as a dispersed tablet, or as a suspension from a powder 
 (powder for oral suspension (pfos)) at a dose of 60 mg/m2 daily. 
 a total of 109 subjects were enrolled and 106 subjects were treated with dasatinib (81 subjects 
 received dasatinib in the tablet form exclusively and 25 subjects received either tablet and/or pfos).</p><p>

 medication performed annually. the majority of the data were collected while subjects were off 
 treatment. follow-up of subjects treated with dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy was 
 collected after the conclusion of the study to monitor these trends. 
 disposition and baseline/demographic characteristics:</p><p>
 a total of 106 subjects were treated with dasatinib. the follow-up period has completed. 
 a total of 78 (73.6%) subjects completed the study treatment period and the primary reason for 
 subjects not completing the treatment period was due to ‘other’ reason (such as physician decision) for 
 9 (8.5%) subjects. six subjects died during the treatment or hsct phase, leaving 100 subjects to</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 enter the follow-up phase. all 100 subjects who entered follow-up have discontinued the study. seventy subjects (70.0%) completed follow-up. 
 bone growth and development assessments 
 long-term growth and development assessments were performed for up to 5 years post-treatment. 
 changes from baseline in height, weight, and bmi were described using standard international units, z-
 scores, and percentile shift frequency.</p></section><section><header>height</header><p>the median height remained above the 15th percentile throughout the duration of the study, but there was a downward trend over time compared to baseline in height z-score in pediatric subjects treated 
 with dasatinib+chemotherapy. mean (sd) and median (range) baseline z-scores for height (n=106) 
 were 0.21 (1.158) and 0.11 (-2.7, 3.3).</p><p>
 the median decrease of height z-score at 1 year was -0.62 (n=105) and -0.82 at year 2 (n=98). the 
 average z-scores remained fairly constant, varying between -0.6 and -0.5 through year 7, indicating 
 that height values did not completely recover over time after discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>however, the 
 sample size decreased over time, leading to increased variability at the later time points. figure 
 7.2.1.1-1 presents box plots of height z-scores over time, for all treated subjects.</p><p>
 in 26 subjects, some alterations in height pattern have been observed: 
 • 7 subjects entered the study with low z-scores and had a sustained percentile &lt;5th during treatment 
 and follow-up. 
 • 8 subjects had a decrease in z-scores below &lt;5th percentile during therapy and/or follow-up period, 
 followed by a later catch-up to values within 10th-97th percentile.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>
 ema/119741/2022</p><p>
 page 8/13</p><p>
 • 11 subjects entered the study with height z-scores values within 10th-97th percentile, but an evident slow of growth was observed after initiation of therapy, with values dropping close to or below the 5th 
 percentile. 4 of these subjects had an initial decline &lt;5th percentile during the follow up.</p></section><section><header>weight</header><p>the z-score for weight was calculated up to 10 years of age only (n = 58), because this indicator may not correctly distinguish between height and body mass in subjects over 10 years old, where many 
 children are experiencing pubertal growth and an increase of weight might incorrectly be considered 
 excessive, when the increase in body mass may be due to an increase in height.</p><p>
 the weight z-scores were similar over time, as shown by little change from baseline in weight z-score 
 and weight percentile shift from baseline. mean (sd) and median (range) baseline z-scores for weight 
 (n=58) were 0.39 (1.271) and 0.41 (-2.4, 3.8). mean weight z-score was 0.4 at baseline, dropped by 
 0.5 in the first year, but at later time points returned to between 0 and 0.5. 
 figure 7.2.1.2-1 presents box plots of weight z-scores over time, for all treated subjects.</p></section><section><header>bmi</header><p>the bmi z-score is standardized by age and gender and calculated for subjects up to the age of 19 years old.</p><p>
 at baseline, the mean bmi for all subjects was 18.2 kg/m2 (range: 12.9 to 30.9 kg/m2). the mean 
 bmi for all subjects gradually increased with time as expected for subjects treated with 
 dasatinib+chemotherapy and during follow-up. 
 the bmi z-scores remained fairly stable over time, varying between 0.6 and 0.9 with no apparent 
 downward or upward trend. for all treated subjects mean (sd) and median (range) baseline z-scores 
 for bms (n=106) were 0.42 (1.295) and 0.41 (-2.4, 4.3), respectively.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 page 9/13</p><p>
 figure 7.2.1.3-1 presents box plots of height z-scores over time, for all treated subjects.</p><p>
 subjects in the &lt;5th-75th percentile baseline bmi category increased their bmi while on study and 
 those with baseline &gt;75th remained unchanged or dropped their bmi percentile. this observation was 
 based on change from baseline in bmi z-score results and on the bmi percentile shift from baseline 
 tabulation. 
 bone age and pubertal status (tanner stage) 
 bone age, a measure of skeletal maturity, and tanner stage, a measure of pubertal maturation, were 
 recorded on an annual basis. the values were correlated with what is expected based on the subjects’ 
 chronologic age). shifts over time from the baseline tanner stage distribution do not suggest any 
 clinical abnormalities in pubertal development associated with dasatinib+chemotherapy.</p><p>
 growth factors 
 insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) and igf binding protein-3 (igfb-3) subunit are required for 
 maximal growth in children. the changes in igf-1 and igfb-3 levels over time were not indicative of 
 any clinical abnormality associated with dasatinib+chemotherapy. 
 declines in igf-1 levels were reported in 25 subjects during therapy. the igf-1 levels were low at 
 screening for 13 subjects and baseline values were missing for 7 subjects. the values returned to 
 within normal levels during follow up for these 20 subjects. low igf-1 values were reported at 
 screening, during treatment and follow up periods in 3 subjects. the baseline igf-1 levels were normal 
 in 2 subjects at study entry, declined during the treatment period and returned to within normal levels 
 during follow up. 
 hormone levels 
 thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) levels are measured to test the overall function of the thyroid, a 
 gland that controls metabolism and hormone regulation in the body. free thyroxine (t4) is used to</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>
 ema/119741/2022</p><p>
 page 10/13</p><p>
 assess thyroid function. follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) are produced by the pituitary gland and regulate the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive 
 processes of the body. overall, the changes in hormone levels over time were not indicative of any 
 clinical abnormality associated with dasatinib+chemotherapy. 
 most subjects had tsh, free t4, fsh, and lh levels that were close to or within normal ranges for age. 
 free t4 and tsh results for 7 subjects were compatible with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but only 
 for 1 subject, substitutive therapy was initiated. in 3 subjects, the lab abnormalities were reported at 
 the last follow up visit and there was no information of clinical diagnoses confirmation or whether 
 substitutive therapy started. in 3 other subjects, the values recovered to normal levels at the next 
 visit. 
 high fsh and lh values were reported for 6 subjects and these values remained elevated throughout 
 the course of the study for 3 of these subjects. for 1 subject, the elevations were isolated occurrences 
 that returned to within normal range and for 2 subjects, the increase levels were reported at the last 
 study visit with no additional confirmation measurements. in addition, 4 subjects had high fsh levels 
 with normal lh values; only in 1 out of the 4 subjects, the elevation remained throughout the study 
 long-term bone metabolism</p></section><section><header>urinary n-telopeptide and bone alp</header><p>long-term growth and development and bone metabolism assessments, including urinary n-terminal telopeptide of type i collagen (ntx) (marker of bone resorption and demonstrated to be useful in 
 evaluating bone growth in children) and bone alkaline phosphatase (alp) were collected for the 
 subjects that continued in follow-up.</p><p>
 high ntx values were reported for 9 subjects during the study. for 8 of these subjects, the elevations 
 in ntx were isolated occurrences that returned to within the normal range in subsequent visits (table 
 s.7.10.11). in only 1 subject, the ntx values remained elevated throughout the study after starting 
 therapy. 
 bone alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline min - max in 61 subjects ranged from 14.6 - 115.2 u/l. 
 generally, bone alkaline phosphatase over time increased but were the elevations were not indicative 
 of any clinical abnormality associated with dasatinib+chemotherapy treatment.</p></section><section><header>bone densitometry</header><p>in addition to the other growth parameters, dual x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) scans were performed. a bone mineral content or density z-score of more than 2 standard deviations below expected (ie less 
 than -2) should be considered ‘low for age’. 
 there were approximately 40% of subjects that had at least 1 z-score considered to be “low for age
 ” per the definition. 99 out of 106 subjects had at least one dxa scan assessment done post-baseline, however, most patients missed at least one data point. 35 subjects had at least 1 post-baseline z-score 
 ≤ -2. in 11 subjects, the z-scores decreased below ≤ -2 and recovered to ≥ -2 values at subsequent assessments and in 24 subjects, the z-score remained 
 ≤ -2 at the last study visit. based on bone densitometry scans of the lumbar spine l1-l4 region, total body less head, total hip, 
 and femoral neck, the assessments did not suggest any relevant findings associated with dasatinib + 
 chemotherapy.

 serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, and phosphorus) were assessed periodically through the treatment period and up to 5 years follow-up. the serum electrolyte results 
 are consistent with the results presented previously in the final ca180372 csr.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.3">2.3.3.  
 rapporteur´s discussion and conclusion on clinical aspects</header><p>study ca180372 which evaluated the addition of dasatinib to successive blocks of standard multiagent chemotherapy in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed ph+ all have previously been 
 assessed and led to the extension of indication for the paediatric population (variation 
 emea/h/c/000709/ii/0059). this current submission provides cumulative long term growth and 
 development data collected and updated os. 
 as summarised by the mah, subjects treated with dasatinib and chemotherapy had a trend downwards 
 for height. for other ltgd parameters with longer follow-up, results are similar to the ones initially 
 reported in the final csr. weight and bmi mean z-scores in dasatinib-treated subjects were relatively 
 unchanged at the end of the follow-up period compared to baseline. the laboratory parameters 
 associated with ltgd and long-term bone metabolism also did not appear to be impacted by 
 dasatinib+chemotherapy treatment. the decrease in growth velocity during treatment followed by a 
 lack of catch-up has been previously described, with the same degree and pattern of changes as 
 observed with the use of standard chemotherapy and therefore, the addition of dasatinib does not 
 seem to exacerbate the condition. hormones and other growth parameters measured during this study 
 did not indicate any abnormality that could contribute to this trend in growth retardation. bmi 
 measured showed a slight increase in subjects in this study. this observation should be interpreted in 
 context of an apparent increase in weight for a given height for most patients and therefore, could be a 
 result of relative height loss with normal weight gain, rather than an accelerated weight gain. 
 this summary and conclusion can be fully endorsed. it is noted that section 4.4 of the smpc provides 
 this information. 
 in paediatric trials of sprycel in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ph+ all paediatric patients after a maximum of 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events 
 associated with bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. this case was a 
 grade 1 osteopenia. growth retardation has been observed in paediatric patients treated with sprycel 
 in clinical trials (see section 4.8). monitoring of bone growth and development in paediatric patients is 
 recommended. 
 although the mah has not proposed any updates of the smpc, it may be considered to revisit this wording in section 4.4 in a future variation, based on the information provided in this dataset. the mah 
 has followed up on this issue and proposed an addition to the text and this is considered an acceptable 
 proposal. 
 in study ca180372 overall survival was included as an exploratory objective. it is agreed that based 
 on the updated numbers in this submission dasatinib in combination with intensive multi-agent 
 chemotherapy continues to show long term os benefit in pediatric patients newly diagnosed with ph+ 
 all, with 79.4% of subjects alive with a follow-up of 5 years after last dose. the current smpc reflects 
 the data on the primary/secondary endpoints and is considered adequate.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.
