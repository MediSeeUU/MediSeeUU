 registrational pediatric study ca180226 leading to approval of dasatinib in newly diagnosed pediatric 
 ph+ cp-cml patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib (procedure

 ca180018 was a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study in which eligible children and adolescents (
 ≥ 1 to &lt; 21 years of age) with relapsed or refractory leukemia were treated with dasatinib orally once daily. mandatory ltgd and bone metabolism testing were added to the study that were to be 
 performed annually while subjects were on dasatinib study therapy and for up to 5 years of follow-up 
 after the last dose of study drug. given that the primary and secondary objectives of study ca180018 
 have been achieved, and a final csr and addendum (addendum 01) reporting those results have been 
 submitted, the article 46 obligations for this study have been fulfilled. the present submission of 
 addendum 02 is considered as an update to provide long-term follow up data to ca180018. 
 no update to the sprycel product information and no update to the risk management plan (rmp) are 
 indicated based on the results of the 5-year follow-up on long-term growth and development in 
 pediatric subjects.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.2">2.3.2.

 ≥ 1 to &lt; 21 years of age) with relapsed or refractory leukemia were treated with dasatinib orally once daily (qd) until disease progression, intolerable 
 toxicity, or patient/physician preference. 
 a total of 58 subjects received study treatment. subjects were grouped into strata based on disease 
 phase: 
 • 17 subjects in stratum 1: ph+ cp-cml • 17 subjects in stratum 2/3: ph+ cml in accelerated phase (ap), ph+ cml in myeloid or lymphoid blast phase (bp), ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), or ph+ aml 
 • 24 subjects in stratum 4: ph- all or aml the starting dose level for all strata was 60 mg/m2 qd. each stratum was escalated independently, 
 following a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme. intra-subject dose escalation was allowed based on 
 tolerance and on individual response. subjects could receive dasatinib qd for up to 2 years, in the 
 absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or per patient/physician preference. with site-
 specific amendments 08 and 09, study therapy could be extended for a further 8 years if clinical 
 benefit persisted after 2 years. subjects were followed until death or up to 5 years after end of 
 treatment. 
 per protocol amendments 05, 06 and 07, mandatory assessments to monitor ltgd and bone 
 metabolism were to be performed annually while subjects were on study therapy, and then followed up 
 yearly for up to 5 years after the last dose. ltgd data is therefore limited and available only for the 8 
 subjects who were on treatment and 10 subjects who were in follow-up at the time the amendment 
 was implemented.</p></section><section><header>results</header><p>all primary and secondary objectives for study ca180018 were met and previously reported. the final csr (dated 04-nov-2011) was submitted in november 2011 to the ema in accordance with</p><p>

 further action required) by chmp on 16-feb-2012. the final ca180018 csr provided preliminary growth and development data as of 28-jun-2011 database lock (dbl).</p><p>
 addendum 01 (dated 01-mar-2017) was submitted in march 2017 to the ema within the grouped 
 extension application / type ii variation procedure emea/h/c/000709/x/0056/g . this csr provided 
 an update on 7 subjects who had been on study treatment at the time of the final csr cutoff, and 
 updated safety and efficacy data, up to dbl of 04-nov-2016. 
 data collection is now completed for ca180018 and an addendum (addendum 02) was prepared in 
 may 2020. the dbl was 19-apr-2017 and lplv for addendum 02 was 01-sep-2016. the actual last 
 visit date was 22-may-2019. after the dbl, bms received paper case report forms from 2 additional 
 safety follow-up visits for 1 subject that could not be added to the database and thus was not included 
 in addendum 02. the subject reported normal physical exam and lab results, and no adverse events or 
 changes to therapy at these follow-up visits. this missing data does not impact the results.</p></section><section><header>efficacy results</header><p>addendum 02 to the csr included final survival data.2 median os remained unchanged since the previous addendum (addendum 01). in cp-cml (stratum 1), 3 out of 17 subjects (17.6%) died and 
 the median survival for this group had not been reached. in ph+ all or ap/bp-cml (stratum 2/3), 12 
 out of 17 subjects (70.6%) died and the median survival for this group was 8.6 months (95% ci: 3.2,

 page 6/13</p></section><section><header>safety results</header><p>in study ca180018, a total of 58 subjects received dasatinib (17 subjects in stratum 1, 17 subjects in stratum 2/3, 24 subjects in stratum 4). dasatinib was tolerated at doses up to 120 mg/m2 and the 
 doses of 60 and 80 mg/m2 qd were confirmed as the recommended phase 2 dose for cp-cml and 
 ph+all or ap/bp-cml respectively. please refer to the previous assessment of details.</p></section><section><header>growth and development assessments</header><p>tests to monitor ltgd and bone metabolism were added to the study as mandatory protocol procedures (table 5.1-1). the assessments were to be performed yearly up to 5 years posttreatment. 
 however, at the time these tests were added, only 8 subjects (7, 1, and 0 subjects in stratum 1, 2/3, 
 and 4, respectively) were on treatment and 10 subjects (6, 4, and 0 in stratum 1,2/3, and 4, 
 respectively) were in follow-up. therefore, with the exception of baseline height and weight, which 
 were already collected for all subjects, and body mass index (bmi), which is derived from height and 
 weight, data on other ltgd assessments were limited to the subset of subjects who remained on study 
 or were evaluated in follow-up at the time the changes were implemented. 
 the final csr presented partial ltgd data, but due to the limited follow-up, no definitive conclusions 
 could be made on the effect of dasatinib therapy on growth in pediatric subjects. data on ltgd and 
 bone metabolism continued to be collected up to 22-may-2019 (lplv). the cumulative ltgd results 
 are reported here.</p></section><section><header>height, weight and bmi</header><p>changes from baseline in height, weight, and bmi were described using si units, z-scores, and percentile shift frequency. height and weight z-scores are designed to take into account the amount of 
 change that would be expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. bmi z-score was 
 standardized by age and gender.</p><p>no subjects from stratum 4 had any measurements for height, weight, and bmi at 1 year and beyond. 
 it is therefore not possible to assess change from baseline for these outcome variables in this stratum. 
 height 
 median height for all treated subjects at baseline was 140.0 cm (range: 115.6 - 159.0 cm). changes in 
 height were recorded in 25 subjects from strata 1 and 2/3 at the 1 year timepoint and in &lt; 25 subjects 
 thereafter. in the cp-cml stratum, there was a weak downward trend over time in height z-score. this 
 was mostly supported by change from baseline in height z-score results, and less so by height 
 percentile shift from baseline tabulation. these results need to be interpreted with caution, since 
 sample sizes were small and decreasing over time. in the ph+ all or ap/bp cml</p><p>and ph- all/aml 
 stratum there was either insufficient or no data to support qualifying statements about growth in terms 
 of height over time.</p><p> assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 page 7/13</p><p> weight median weight for all treated subjects at baseline was 36.55 kg (range: 9.1 - 85.5 kg). changes in 
 weight were recorded in 53 subjects at the 1 year timepoint; thereafter, fewer than 17 subjects were 
 recorded at each subsequent timepoint. in general, each subject remained in the same percentile 
 weight group, particularly cp-cml subjects. z-score for weight was calculated only on subjects &lt; 10 
 years of age (n = 26). information regarding growth in terms of body weight z-score was too little to 
 support any interpretation for any of the strata.</p><p> assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 page 8/13</p><p>bmi at baseline, mean bmi was 18.8 kg/m2 (range: 12.3 to 29.4 kg/m2). changes in bmi were recorded in 
 25 subjects from strata 1 and 2/3 at the 1 year timepoint and in &lt; 25 subjects thereafter. in general, 
 subjects in the low bmi category (underweight) increased their bmi to the healthy range while on 
 study and those with high bmis remained unchanged or dropped their bmi to a healthier percentile. 
 in the cp-cml stratum, there was no downward trend over time in bmi z-score. this was based on 
 change from baseline in bmi z-score results and on bmi percentile shift from baseline tabulation. these 
 results need to be interpreted with caution, since sample sizes were small and decreasing over time. in 
 the ph+ all or ap/bp cml and ph- all/aml stratum there was either insufficient or no data to support 
 qualifying statements about growth in terms of bmi over time.</p><p> assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 radiographs of the left hand and wrist obtained on an annual basis. bone age was measured in 13 
 subjects (9 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects from stratum 2/3, 0 subjects from stratum 4).</p><p>
 tanner stage, an indicator of pubertal status, was measured in 16 subjects (12 subjects from stratum

 expected based on the subjects’ chronologic age.</p><p>
 growth factors 
 insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) and igf binding protein-3 (igfb-3) subunit are required for 
 maximal growth in children. igf-1 is produced by many tissues, but the liver is the main source of 
 circulating igf-1. igf-1 is the major mediator of the anabolic and growth-promoting effects of growth 
 hormone (gh). igf-1 is transported by igfb-3, which also controls its bioavailability and half-life. the 
 secretion patterns of igf-1 and igfb-3 mimic each other, their respective syntheses controlled by gh.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 malnutrition is associated with low igf-1. igf-1 and igfb-3 were measured in 15 subjects (11 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects from stratum 2/3, and 0 subjects from stratum 4). 
 igf-1 and igfb-3 levels over time were not indicative of any clinical abnormality associated with 
 dasatinib in any strata. however, the limited sample sizes and number of samples in the follow-up 
 period make it difficult to assess the impact of dasatinb on growth factors over time in pediatric 
 subjects. 
 hormone levels 
 sh levels are measured to test the overall function of the thyroid, a gland that controls metabolism 
 and hormone regulation in the body. growth and development are commonly affected in children with 
 abnormal thyroid function (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). normal tsh levels vary depending 
 on age and stage of growth. the normal tsh level for children who have not yet reached puberty is 
 between 0.6 to 5.5 units per milliliter (uu/ml) and for adults and adolescents who have reached 
 puberty is between 0.5 to 4.8 uu/ml. 
 free t4 is used to assess thyroid function. high t4 is indicative of hyperthyroidism, while low t4 is 
 indicative of hypothyroidism. 
 free t4 was measured in 15 subjects (11 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects from stratum 2/3, 0 
 subjects from stratum 4). tsh was measured in 16 subjects (12 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects 
 from stratum 2/3, 0 subjects from stratum 4). all levels were within normal reference ranges for age. 
 fsh and lh are produced by the pituitary gland and regulate the development, growth, pubertal 
 maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. they are essential for reproduction in both males 
 and females. normal fsh levels are between 3 and 20 miu/ml and normal lh levels are between 5 
 and 20 miu/ml. fsh and lh levels can fluctuate; however, levels greater than 30 or 40 miu/ml are 
 indicative of ovarian failure. 
 one female subject (cp-cml) with a history of unexpected primary ovarian failure and who received 
 chemotherapy before study entry, received study drug from mar-2007 to apr-2009, and presented 
 high fsh and lh levels (96-97 u/l and 53-57 u/l) in post treatment. a second female subject (ap-
 cml) had high fsh and lh levels (118 u/l and 51.8 u/l) during follow up that later normalized with 
 further follow up. 
 four other subjects had at least one fsh and lh measurement that was greater than 20 u/l but less 
 than 40 u/l. due to the limited sample size subjects in the follow up period, and limited number of 
 samples, it is difficult to interpret the impact of dasatinib on hormone levels over time in pediatric 
 subjects. 
 long-term bone metabolism assessments 
 urinary n-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase urinary n-telopeptide of type i collagen (ntx) and bone alkaline phosphatase levels over time were monitored as a specific marker of bone resorption. 
 ntx levels were assessed in 14 subjects (10 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects from stratum 2/3); 
 min - max in 14 subjects was 18 - 9698 nmol/mmol creatinine. most subjects had at least one ntx 
 measurement above normal; however, due to the limited sample size subjects in the follow up period, 
 and limited number of samples, it is difficult to interpret the impact of dasatinib on ntx levels over 
 time in pediatric subjects. 
 bone alkaline phosphatase levels were assessed in 13 subjects (9 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects 
 from stratum 2/3); min - max in 13 subjects ranged from 3 - 123 u/l. generally, bone alkaline</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 page 11/13</p><p>
 phosphatase results over time were not indicative of any clinical abnormality associated with dasatinib in any strata. however, the assessment of results is difficult due to the limited number of subjects and 
 samples. 
 bone densitometry in addition to the other growth parameters, dual x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) scan was measured in 12 subjects (8 subjects from stratum 1, 4 subjects from stratum 2/3). a bone mineral content or density 
 z-score of more than 2 standard deviations below expected (ie less than -2) should be considered ‘low 
 for age’. 
 no subject in the cp-cml group was considered to be “low for age” per the definition. two subjects in 
 stratum 2/3 had low bone density z-scores otherwise. 
 serum electrolytes serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, and phosphorus) were assessed periodically through the treatment period and up to 5 years follow-up. generally, few subjects had 
 grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.3">2.3.3.  
 discussion and conclusion on clinical aspects</header><p>study ca180018 evaluated qd dosing in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia. dasatinib showed encouraging efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose of 60 mg/m2 qd 
 for pediatric subjects with cp-cml (stratum 1) and 80 mg/m2 for subjects with ph+ all or ap/bp-cml 
 (stratum 2/3), as reported previously in the final ca180018 csr. 
 amendments 05, 06, and 07 added mandatory tests to monitor ltgd at yearly intervals while subjects 
 were on dasatinib study therapy and for up to 5 years of follow-up after the last dose. this addendum 
 provides cumulative ltgd data collected, long-term efficacy (os) and safety. there was an ae of 
 grade 3 growth retardation reported in the final csr as unresolved in a subject from strata 1 (cp-
 cml); during this extended follow-up the ae was completely resolved after approximately 4 years. the 
 subject
 ’s final height and weight were 180 cm and 71.1 kg, respectively. studies with imatinib treatment in pediatric subjects with cml-cp have reported slower growth for 
 height and effects on endocrine function.10,11,12 tkis appear to impact growth in ph + all more 
 than that reported for subjects with cml; this could be attributed to the younger age at exposure, or it 
 may also reflect receipt of concurrent multi-drug intensive therapy. 
 long-term growth and development parameters 
 height, weight, and bmi mean z-scores in dasatinib-treated subjects were relatively unchanged at the 
 end of the follow-up period compared to baseline. the laboratory parameters associated with ltgd 
 and long-term bone metabolism also did not appear to be impacted by dasatinib treatment. 
 due to the timing of amendments 05, 06, 07, only 8 subjects were continuing treatment and 10 
 subjects were in the follow-up period. some subjects only had one assessment timepoint for one or 
 more of the ltgd parameters. all subjects received prior imatinib before study entry and many also 
 received prior chemotherapy and/or transplant before or after study participation. all these are 
 confounding factors that affect the analysis of the potential effect of dasatinib on growth and 
 development. therefore, interpretations of this limited data set should be made with caution. 
 information that is more relevant will be available from the phase 2 ca180226 study that includes a 
 cohort of subjects naïve to imatinib where the effect of dasatinib would be better assessed.</p><p>assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to article 46 of the regulation (ec) no 1901/2006</p><p>

 overall survival the median os did not change from previously reported results. no additional deaths were reported 
 with the extended follow-up period. median os was still not reached in stratum 1 (cp-cml) subjects. 
 overall safety 
 with the longer follow-up, no new late toxicities were reported. dasatinib is well-tolerated and safe in 
 pediatric and adolescent subjects with refractory or relapsed leukemia. the safety profile is consistent 
 with what is expected in this patient population.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4.  
 chmp conclusion</header><p>dasatinib is approved for the use in ph+ cp-cml paediatric subjects based on study ca180226 and ca180018. in ca180018, ltgd assessments were added but due to the timing of the amendments, 
 ltgd data is limited and only available on 18 subjects who were receiving treatment or in follow-up at 
 the time the amendments were implemented. the ltgd data was collected in a subset of subjects for 
 up to 5 years post-treatment.</p><p>the benefit risk for the use of dasatinib in imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant cp-cml and newly-
 diagnosed cp-cml paediatric patients remains positive. the safety profile of dasatinib in the paediatric 
 population is still generally consistent with data reported in adult population. it is agreed that the 
 available information from ca180018 study does not indicate clinically relevant growth and 
 development issues associated with dasatinib treatment in paediatric patients; however, it is difficult to 
 draw any definitive conclusions from the limited data set. 
 the mah will monitor risks using routine pharmacovigilance and will update the label as indicated.</p><p>it is noted that no update to the product information or rmp is requested based on the submitted data. 
 the current rmp</p><p>v16.1, states that
 ‘growth and development disorders and bone mineral metabolism disorders in the pediatric population
 ’ has been identified as an ‘important potential risk’. information on effects on growth and development in paediatric patients are included in section 4.4 of 
 the smpc and section 4.8 includes the general description of the safety profile in paediatric patients. 
 no further updates are considered needed.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.
