 scientific discussion</header></section><section><header>problem statement</header><p>the european commission granted a marketing authorization for sprycel in november 2006 for the following indications: 
 for the treatment of adult patients with: 
 newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) in the 
 chronic phase.</p><p>
 chronic, accelerated or blast phase cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including 
 imatinib. 
 ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) and lymphoid blast cml with resistance or intolerance to 
 prior therapy. 
 for the treatment of paediatric patients with: 
 newly diagnosed ph+ cml in chronic phase (ph+ cml-cp) or ph+ cml-cp resistant or intolerant to 
 prior therapy including imatinib. 
 the scope of this variation is the extension of indication of dasatinib</p><p>in combination with 
 chemotherapyfor the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed ph+ all.</p></section><section><header>disease or condition</header><p>the proposed indication is for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed ph+ all in combination with chemotherapy.</p></section><section><header>epidemiology and risk factors</header><p>the annual incidence of all in childhood is approximately 9 to 10 cases per 100,000, with 3% to 5% of cases being ph+ all. all is the most common form of cancer during childhood, affecting about 
 2500 children annually in europe [1].</p></section><section><header>biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis</header><p>paediatric all is a biologically heterogeneous cancer with multiple genetically defined subtypes. the disease is characterized by the accumulation of malignant lymphoblasts in the marrow or in various</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 8/80</p><p> 
 extramedullary sites, frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. the presence of the philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 
 22 that creates the bcr-abl fusion protein, defines a well-known subtype of all which is associated 
 with a poorer prognosis.</p></section><section><header>clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis</header><p>patients with all may present with a variety of hematologic derangements ranging from pancytopenia to hyperleukocytosis. the symptoms of all develop rapidly and are indicative of a reduced production 
 of functional blood cells and bone marrow metaplasia, thus including fever, pain, increased risk of 
 infections, increased tendency to bleed and signs indicative of anaemia, including pallor, tachycardia, 
 fatigue, and headache.</p></section><section><header>management</header><p>the standard of care for newly-diagnosed children and adolescents with ph+ all varies somewhat among the paediatric cooperative groups. before the development of abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
 (tkis), there was no consensus on the optimal treatment of ph+ all.</p><p>
 in eu, imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
 philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ph+ all) integrated with 
 chemotherapy. 
 the survival rate among subjects with ph+ all still lags behind most other cytogenetic subgroups in 
 paediatric all. until recently, hsct in first complete remission offered the best opportunity for long-
 term efs for children with ph+ all, with an improvement in disease free survival of up to 65% and os 
 72%. this strategy is limited by the availability of a suitably matched donor, by the risk of post-
 transplant–related morbidity and mortality and by relapses after hsct, particularly in those who are 
 mrd positive prior to transplantation. paediatric patients with no suitable donor for hsct have an even 
 more critical unmet need for disease management.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>dasatinib inhibits the activity of the bcr abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and pdgfβ receptor. 
 dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the bcr abl kinase with potency at concentration of 
 0.6 0.8 nm. it binds to both the inactive and active conformations of the bcr abl enzyme (smpc, 
 section 5.1). 
 in vitro, dasatinib is active in leukaemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib sensitive and 
 resistant disease. these non-clinical studies show that dasatinib can overcome imatinib resistance 
 resulting from bcr abl overexpression, bcr abl kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate 
 signalling pathways involving the src family kinases (lyn, hck), and multidrug resistance gene 
 overexpression. additionally, dasatinib inhibits src family kinases at subnanomolar concentrations 
 (smpc, section 5.1). 
 in vivo, in separate experiments using murine models of cml, dasatinib prevented the progression of 
 chronic cml to blast phase and prolonged the survival of mice bearing patient derived cml cell lines 
 grown at various sites, including the central nervous system (smpc, section 5.1). 
 the recommended starting daily dosage of sprycel tablets in paediatric patients is shown in table 1.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 there are two dasatinib formulations for use in paediatric patients: (1) film-coated tablets and (2) powder for oral suspension (pfos) for use in paediatric patients who cannot swallow or choose not to 
 take the tablets. dasatinib film-coated tablets are available in strengths of 20, 50, 70, 80, 100, and 
 140 mg and dasatinib pfos is a powdered drug product, which, when constituted with water, provides 
 a suspension at a dasatinib concentration of 10 mg/ml.</p><p>
 a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model was developed and used to describe the clinical 
 behaviours (be, food effect, and particle size effect) of dasatinib pfos and tablet in paediatric patients. 
 body surface area (bsa)-normalized dosing was evaluated in paediatric clinical trials. additionally, wt-
 tiered dosing was evaluated using ppk model-based simulations. 
 dose-response (d-r) and exposure-response (e-r) relationships were characterized in paediatric 
 patients with newly diagnosed ph+ cp-cml from the phase 2 study ca180226.</p><p>
 pharmacokinetics of dasatinib tablet in paediatric patients 
 non-compartmental analysis (nca) pk analysis of dasatinib tablet formulation was performed using 
 data collected in 72 paediatric subjects age ≥ 1 year old with relapsed or refractory leukemia or solid 
 tumors (ca180018 and ca180038). the investigated once-daily (qd) and twice-daily (bid) doses 
 ranged from 60 to 120 mg/m
 2 and 50 to 110 mg/m2, respectively. the dasatinib tablet was rapidly absorbed with a mean time of maximum observed concentration (tmax) between 0.5 and 6 hours. 
 mean half-life (t-half) ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. similar to that 
 observed in adults, high inter-subject variability was observed in the pk parameters of paediatric 
 subjects, with coefficient of variation (cv) of maximum concentration (cmax) and area under the 
 concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (auc[inf]) greater than 50% for the 60-mg/m
 2 tablet. dasatinib pk showed dose proportionality with a dose-related increase in exposure observed in this paediatric population. there was no significant difference in dasatinib pk between children and 
 adolescents. the geometric means of dose-normalized (dn) dasatinib cmax, area under the 
 concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration (auc[0-t]), and 
 auc(inf) were similar between children and adolescents across dose levels. 
 pharmacokinetics of dasatinib powder for oral suspension in adult and paediatric patients 
 dasatinib pfos was developed as an age-appropriate formulation for paediatric patients who cannot 
 swallow the tablet formulation. study ca180352 compared the pk of dasatinib pfos to the intact 
 tablet formulation in 77 healthy adult subjects. results showed that the exposure (by auc[inf]) with 
 pfos was approximately 19% less than that obtained with intact tablets in healthy adults treated with 
 a dose of 60 mg/m
 2. on the basis of these results, a pfos dose of 72 mg/m2 was selected to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pk of dasatinib in paediatric patients age ≥ 1 year old with newly diagnosed 
 cp-cml (cohort 3b of ca180226). this dose was selected to match exposure for the selected phase 2 
 dose of intact tablet at 60 mg/m
 2. the concentration data from the pfos cohort of study ca180226 (cohort 3) was pooled with data 
 from the phase 1 studies for a population pharmacokinetic (ppk) analysis (694 observed 
 concentrations from 104 paediatric subjects). the analysis characterized the pk of dasatinib in 
 paediatric subjects by a linear 2-compartment model with first-order absorption, similar to that of the 
 pk model in adult cml subjects. both the apparent clearance (cl/f) and central volume of distribution 
 (vc/f) increased with increasing body weight (wt) in paediatric subjects. the analysis showed that the 
 bioavailability of pfos was approximately 40% lower than that of tablet in paediatric patients, and as a 
 result of the low bioavailability, the exposure of pfos (as measured by time-averaged concentration at 
 steady state [cavgss]) at 72 mg/m
 2 was approximately 30% lower than that of the tablet at 60 mg/m2 in paediatric subjects newly diagnosed with cp-cml.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 drug-drug interactions dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, and cyp3a4 plays a major role in its metabolism. when a single morning dose of dasatinib was administered in adults following 8 days of continuous 
 evening administration of 600 mg of rifampin, a potent cyp3a4 inducer, the mean cmax and auc of 
 dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively. substances that inhibit cyp3a4 activity may 
 decrease metabolism and increase concentrations of dasatinib. a 20-mg dasatinib qd co-administered 
 with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily in adults increased the dasatinib cmax and auc by four- and 
 five-fold, respectively.</p><p>
 dasatinib is a weak cyp3a4 inhibitor and has little potential to induce cyp3a4. single-dose data from a 
 study in adults indicate that the mean cmax and auc of simvastatin, a cyp3a4 substrate, were 
 increased by 37% and 20%, respectively, when simvastatin was administered in combination with a 
 single 100-mg dose of dasatinib.</p><p>

 dasatinib plasma concentration data were collected in paediatric leukaemia patients in the phase 1 study ca180018. ca180018 was an open-label, dose-escalation (3+3 design, intra-subject dose 
 escalation) study in children and adolescents/adults, ≥ 1 to &lt; 21 years of age, who were treated with 
 dasatinib orally 60, 80, 100 and 120 mg/m
 2 qd until refractory disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient/physician preference.

 the qd schedule had similar overall efficacy and improved safety as compared with the bid schedule in 
 adults. once-daily dosing in the paediatric population was, therefore, selected over the bid dosing 
 schedule. 
 in a phase 1 dose-escalation study (ca180018) of dasatinib in children and adolescents with relapsed 
 or refractory leukemia, treatment responses were seen in ph+ patients who received single-agent 
 dasatinib 60 or 80 mg/m
 2. no maximum tolerated dose was identified up to doses of 120 mg/m2 daily. rates of both major cytogenic response (mcyr) and complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) among 17 
 paediatric patients with advanced phase cml/ph+ all (stratum 2/3) were 50% and 77.7% with 60 
 mg/m
 2 and 80 mg/ m2 qd, respectively. the proportion of subjects in this stratum with drug-related saes was 25% and 33% in the 60 and 80 mg/m
 2 cohorts, respectively. based on these data and preliminary cog aall0622 data which showed that 60 mg/m
 2 qd can be safely combined with chemotherapy, the 60 mg/m
 2 qd dose was selected for further testing in the phase 2 study ca180372. the benefit-risk profile at the tablet dose of 60 mg/m
 2 in paediatric ph+ all was further characterized in the phase 2 study ca180372. the 3-year binomial efs rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 
 66.0% (90% ci: 57.7, 73.7), which was superior compared to chemotherapy alone in aieop-bfm 
 2000 (49.2% [90% ci: 38.0, 60.4]), and non-inferior (90% ci: -3.3, 17.2) compared to continuous 
 imatinib plus chemotherapy in the amended esphall trial (59.1% [90% ci: 51.8, 66.2]). the safety 
 profile of dasatinib treatment in paediatric subjects with treatment-naive ph+ all indicated that daily 
 dasatinib dosing was well-tolerated and safe. no new safety signals were observed. the most common 
 dasatinib-related aes were anemia (28.3%), neutropenia (24.5%), and febrile neutropenia (23.6%), 
 which were consistent with the known safety profile of dasatinib. 
 the tablet is available in the strength of 20, 50, 70, 80 and 100 mg. a wt-tiered dosing in paediatric 
 patients was selected to produce similar summary steady-state exposures to target exposures of the</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 19/80</p><p> 
 60-mg/m2 tablet qd. the dosing was evaluated by simulating dasatinib exposures for each wt tier using the developed paediatric ppk model (5-120 kg with every 5-kg increment) under various dosing 
 scenarios, taking into account the available tablet dosing strengths. the difference of exposure 
 measures produced by the selected wt-tiered dosing was less than 20% from the reference exposure 
 for all wt tiers.</p><p>
 the wt-tiered dosing is also recommended for paediatric ph+ all based on the same set of 
 simulations, which is supported by the following: 
 1) there were no marked disease-related differences in the pk parameters of dasatinib, both in adults 
 and in paediatrics. figure 3 shows the distribution of ppk model estimated dasatinib clearance by 
 paediatric disease status.</p></section><section><header>figure 3 ppk model-estimated individual clearance, by disease status</header><p>2) the same reference dose of tablet 60 mg/m2 has been showed in study ca180226 to be safe and efficacious in paediatric cp-cml patients, as well as in study ca180372 with a favorable benefit-risk 
 profile when co-administered with chemotherapy in paediatric ph+ all patients. 
 3) dasatinib pk is unlikely to be changed when it is co-administered with chemotherapy in treating 
 paediatric ph+ all. 
 the previously conducted ppk model based simulation can, therefore, be applied to recommending 
 wt-tiered dosing in paediatric ph+ all, by matching the same reference exposure of the 60 mg/m
 2 tablet.</p><p>
 • dose selection and justification for pfos in paediatric patients newly diagnosed with ph+ all the use of the pfos formulation was introduced into study ca180372 in order to provide dosing flexibility for the very young children (as young as 1 year old) enrolled who experienced difficulty with 
 the tablet formulation (whole or dispersed). 
 in procedure emea/h/c/000709/x/0056/g, a bioequivalence study was submitted (ca180352) to 
 compare the ratio and extent of absorption of dasatinib between 100 mg dasatinib pfos and 2 x 50 
 mg dasatinib tablet as reference (table 7).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 a auc(inf) could not be determined in 3 subjects (10052, 10057, and 10060) after receiving treatment a.</p><p>results showed that the pfos and the dispersed tablet were not bioequivalent to the reference tablet formulation. the exposure (by auc[inf]) for pfos was found to be approximately 19% less than that 
 with intact tablets in healthy adults. these results suggested a dose increase of 20% may be needed 
 when using the pfos formulation to potentially match the exposure of the tablet formulation in adults.</p><p>
 there were no safety data available at that time on the impact of such a dose increase on ph+ all 
 paediatric patients, who were being treated with chemotherapy. the pfos dose was not increased to 
 72 mg/m
 2 until further safety evidence was available. pfos dose of 72 mg/m
 2 was further studied in paediatric subjects with treatment-naïve cp-cml in study ca180226. the pk, efficacy, and safety of pfos 72 mg/m
 2 provided the basis for dose recommendation of paediatric cp-cml patients. the result of this trial suggested that a dose of 
 dasatinib pfos 72 mg/m
 2 may not be sufficient to achieve a comparable exposure level to that from a 60 mg/m
 2 tablet in cml paediatric patients, and that an increase to 90 mg/m2 may be needed. a pbpk model indicated the mechanism that likely drives reduced bioavailability for suspension treatments 
 relative to tablets is inherent to the 
 in vivo gastric behaviour of the two different dosage forms (shorter gastric transit for suspensions) and not likely related to the formulation composition. safety data from 
 study ca180226 showed that the pfos dose could safely be increased from 60 mg/m
 2 to 72 mg/m2. since the pk of dasatinib was assessed to be independent of disease state (ie, cml or all) and given 
 the safety data already accumulated in ph+ all population with dasatinib 60 mg/m
 2 tablet combined with chemotherapy, it was determined that a dose increase of pfos to at least 72 mg/m
 2 in ph+ all paediatric patients would be safe. however, the pfos dose was not increased to 72 mg/m
 2 because study enrollment had closed and the treatment for the remaining subjects was near to completion. 
 therefore, pfos continued to be offered at 60 mg/m
 2 in study ca180372. the dasatinib pfos dose recommendation for paediatric ph+ all is identical to the dose 
 recommendation for cp-cml. in study ca180372, 24 subjects received at least 1 dose of the pfos, 
 and 8 out of the 24 were administered this formulation exclusively.</p><p>
 specifically, the previous ppk model was developed using data from multiple studies including data 
 from ph+ all paediatric subjects. given the pk similarity between disease statuses, the ppk model 
 inference was expected to apply to ph+ all as well. the model identified ~40% lower bioavailability of 
 pfos, which was reflected in the wt-tiered dosing table by a fixed ratio between pfos and tablet 
 doses in each wt tier.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 21/80</p><p> 
 dasatinib was tolerated at tablet doses up to 120 mg/m2 and showed a safety profile that was manageable in paediatric subjects with leukemia. exposure resulting from the wt-tiered dosing of 
 pfos was expected to be similar to tablet 60 mg/m
 2 and, therefore, within the established safety margin.</p><p>

 dasatinib is primarily metabolised by cyp3a4 however most chemotherapeutic agents used for ph+

 administered with chemotherapy.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 concomitant use of dexamethasone, a weak cyp3a4 inducer, with dasatinib is allowed; dasatinib auc is predicted to decrease approximately 25% with concomitant use of dexamethasone, which is not 
 likely to be clinically meaningful (smpc, section 4.5). 
 a be study in healthy adults concluded that the bioavailability of pfos was approximately 19 % lower 
 compared to tablets and therefore a dose of 72 mg/m
 2 pfos was expected to be comparable to the tablet dose of 60 mg/m2 and used in the cp-cml studies. however, the pfos dose of 60 mg/m
 2 was not increased in the ph+ all study ca 180372 as enrolment was completed. in study ca180372, out 
 of 106 subjects, 24 received at least one pfos dose and only 8 subjects were treated with pfos</p><p>
 exclusively.</p><p>
 dasatinib exposure measures appeared to be consistent across disease type (cp-cml and ph+-all) for 
 both adult and paediatric subjects, though pk data from paediatric ph+ all subjects are limited. pop 
 pk analysis in paediatric subjects has showed that the bioavailability of pfos is even lower in 
 paediatric subjects. the analysis showed that the bioavailability of pfos was approximately 40% lower 
 than that of tablet in paediatric patients. this is expected to be due to faster gastric transit time of the 
 formulation. the importance of an oral solution is acknowledged. paediatric subjects treated also with 
 chemotherapy may have difficulties swallowing tablets and will have a high need for an alternative oral 
 formulation. however, no clinical data are available to support the proposed dose and no pk data are 
 available from paediatric ph+ all patients treated only or partly with pfos. with the use of a pbpk 
 model the applicant has adequately justified the proposed pfos dose.</p><p>the mah has not planned to conduct a “window” study with the pfos dose 90 mg/m
 2 in ph-positive paediatric all. a pbpk model has been used to justify the proposed pfos dose. the results showed 
 that dasatinib exposure is likely to increase modestly for both tablet and pfos with gi toxicity 
 (including change in gastric transit time and small intestinal transit time, inflammation related change 
 in permeability, and variations of gastric ph values). the modest increase in exposure is not 
 considered to be clinically relevant and especially no impact on clinical efficacy due to gi toxicity is 
 expected. even though the model has some limitations, it is acknowledged that pk should not be 
 further explored in the rare and vulnerable target population of this application. the presented 
 simulations and justifications for a bridging strategy between cp-cml and ph+-all are considered 
 adequate.</p><p>
 for cp-cml a pfos dose of 90 mg/m
 2 has been proposed and endorsed by chmp, but bioequivalence will be investigated in a pk window study in cp-cml conducted post-approval. as the pk, including 
 bioavailability, of dasatinib appear to be comparable across disease status, the pfos dose used in cp-
 cml has also been endorsed for the ph+ all indication. the mah is committed to provide the results 
 of this pk-window study post-approval. in relation to this it needs to stressed that although (based on 
 the mechanistic understanding, the analysis of efficacy versus gi toxicity, formulation and patient 
 populations, and the analysis of pk in the different patient populations) the pbpk model is considered 
 to provide reassuring data on the extrapolation of pk across the patient populations, the pbpk model is 
 not fully validated. the chmp recommended the mah to confirm (post-approval) that post-approval 
 analysis will be conducted to demonstrate that the pbpk model adequately captures the effects of 
 chemotherapy on absorption in line with the existing guideline on reporting and qualification of pbpk 
 models.</p><p>.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4.

 • rates of hsct and safety of post-hsct dasatinib</p></section><section><header>outcomes/endpoints</header><p>• the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the 3-year binomial efs rate. efs was defined as the time from the starting date of dasatinib (upon confirmation that all is ph+ all) until an 
 event. in the primary analysis, the 3-year efs response rate was defined as the number of 
 subjects without event after 3 years since the start of dasatinib divided by the number of 
 treated subjects. events for efs are defined as any first one of the following: lack of complete 
 response in bone marrow; relapse at any site; development of second malignant neoplasm; 
 death from any cause. 
 secondary endpoints: 
 • efs defined as the time from the starting date of dasatinib (upon confirmation that all is ph+ all) until an event. 
 the efs endpoint is also considered for secondary/sensitivity analyses, including: 
 1.</p><p>hsct considered as an event if the subject discontinues 
 2.</p><p>lost to follow-up considered as an event (at the date of last contact) 
 3.</p><p>induction failures considered as an event at time 0

 • bcr-abl mutation defined as the presence of a detectable amino acid substitution in the abl kinase domain. 
 exploratory endpoints: 
 • efs by mrd level and concordance between assessment methods. • disease-free survival (dfs) defined as the time of first day of complete response (m1 bone marrow) until relapse at any site, development of a second malignant neoplasm, or death 
 without relapse. the definition of relapse used for dfs is the same as for efs. subjects who 
 neither relapse nor die or who are lost to follow-up will be censored on the date of their last 
 assessment. subjects who undergo hsct would not be considered as having an event, and 
 would continue to be followed. 
 • overall survival defined as time from the first day of dasatinib treatment until the time of death. subjects who have not died or who are lost to follow-up will be censored on the last 
 date the subject is known to be alive.</p></section><section><header>sample size</header><p>the sample size and power calculations incorporated the following assumptions: • 3-year efs rate of chemotherapy alone in aieop-bfm was 52% (41 event free out of 79 subjects) 
 • 3-year efs rate of continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy (amended esphall trial) will be 78% (70 event free out of 90) (assumes the same rate as 3-year efs rate of continuous 
 imatinib plus chemotherapy in cog aall0031) 
 • 3-year efs rate of continuous dasatinib plus chemotherapy will be 88% (absolute improvement of 10% over imatinib plus chemotherapy) 
 • a non-inferiority margin of 5% (corresponding to approximately 1/4 of the effect size of 18% anticipated in the amended esphall trial over the chemotherapy-only historical control) 
 • one-sided type i error rate of 0.05</p><p>based on the above assumptions, this study required 75 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint, 
 including at least 20 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint in each of the following age ranges: 1 
 to &lt; 12 years and 12 to &lt; 18 years. this sample size yielded 100% power to detect a true difference 
 of 36% in 3-year efs of dasatinib plus chemotherapy (aieop bfm 2000) over chemotherapy alone 
 (aieop-bfm 2000). 
 for non-inferiority testing against imatinib plus chemotherapy 75 subjects would yield 83% power to 
 reject 
 the 
 null 
 hypothesis 
 and 
 declare 
 non-inferiority 
 of 
 dasatinib/chemotherapy 
 and 
 imatinib/chemotherapy (esphall). 
 under the same assumptions, a sample size of 75 subjects would yield 54% power to detect a true 
 difference of 10% in 3-year efs between dasatinib/chemotherapy over imatinib /chemotherapy 
 (esphall).</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 it was assumed that the rate of subjects discontinuing study participation prior to reaching 3 years of follow-up from the start of dasatinib without having an event, might potentially reach 20%. additional 
 15 subjects were to be treated in order to assure robustness of the long-term efficacy and safety 
 analysis results. the planned number of subjects to be treated was between 75 and 90. under the 
 assumption of treating 90 subjects, the power for the non-inferiority analysis would be 85%, and for 
 the final superiority analysis the power would be 56%.</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>the study was a single arm study.</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>the study was an open-label study.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>general methods analyses and summaries were, except where indicated otherwise, based on the whole target study population, as well as on the following sub-populations: 
 o subjects treated with dasatinib tablets only (identified in table presentations as tablet only), 
 o subjects who at any time received dasatinib in the pfos formulation (identified in table presentations as pfos used) 
 efficacy analyses efficacy analyses were based on all treated subjects and mainly consisted of response rates, kaplan-meier plots for time to event variables, and 3-year and 5-year efs and dfs rates. the subjects who 
 were enrolled in this study (ca180372) were considered cohort 1 and the external historical controls 
 aieop-bfm 2000 and amended esphall were considered cohort 2 and cohort 3, respectively. 
 primary endpoint analyses were performed in hierarchical order as follows: 
 • superiority of cohort 1 over cohort 2 • non-inferiority of cohort 1 to cohort 3 • superiority of cohort 1 over cohort 3 the differences in 3-year efs rates were computed using binomial proportions of subjects who were 
 free of events at 3 years over all treated subjects. subjects lost to follow-up at any time without an 
 event were considered event free in the primary analysis. event rates were provided with exact 2-
 sided 90% clopper-pearson ci’s. differences in event rates were tested at the 0.05 1-sided 
 significance level using a pearson χ
 2 test. non-inferiority testing against the study treatment in the amended esphall trial were carried out using the corresponding 2-sided 90% ci for the treatment 
 difference (3-year efs rate in dasatinib+chemo minus 3-year efs rate in imatinib+chemo) and 
 comparing the lower confidence limit to the non-inferiority margin of -5%. next to performing the 
 above analyses on all treated subjects, the same analyses were performed on subjects with</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 in the discontinuous dasatinib group and 20 in the continuous dasatinib group; 3 non-eligible subjects 
 were excluded from the efficacy analysis). a total of 33 (60%) paediatric subjects completed study 
 treatment. the most common reason in paediatric subjects in the combined cohorts for not completing 
 study treatment was bone marrow transplant (n = 13, 23.6%). two paediatric subjects were reported 
 to have disease progression during the study. reasons for not continuing in the study included: 
 enrolment onto another cog study with therapeutic intent (9.1%), death (12.7%), and 3 (5.5%) 
 subjects considered ineligible after having started treatment. a summary of key demographic 
 characteristics of study ca180204 is presented in table 29.</p></section><section><header>table 29 summary of key demographic characteristics-study ca180204</header><p>the median duration of dasatinib therapy from first through last dasatinib dose date was 31.31 months. 
 subjects were categorized by risk: standard risk was defined as m1 (bone marrow status of &lt; 5% 
 lymphoblasts/complete response in bone marrow) with mrd &lt; 1% at end induction and mrd &lt; 0.01% 
 at end consolidation block 2; high risk was defined as mrd ≥ 1% at end induction or mrd ≥ 0.01%

 discussion on clinical efficacy</header></section><section><header>design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>this application is based on two studies. the main study ca180372 is a phase 2, open-label, multi-center single-arm, historically-controlled study in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed ph+ 
 all. included patients were given continuous dasatinib added to a ph+ all chemotherapy regimen, 
 based on regimens from the aieop-bfm all 2000 study and the amended esphall. the primary 
 objective was to compare the 3-year efs of dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy with external 
 historical controls.</p><p>
 the supportive study ca180204 was a phase 2, open-label, multi-center, single-arm study including 
 children and young adults with newly diagnosed ph+ all to be treated also with dasatinib 60 mg/m
 2 daily by oral tablet. study ca180204 was based on a different chemotherapy backbone therapy than that used in ca180372, and the number of subjects in study ca180204 who received dasatinib 
 continuously was limited to 20 subjects. this study was terminated early due to the opening of the main 
 study.</p><p>
 the clinical studies were performed with few amendments, withdrawals or lost to follow-up. 
 introduction of an oral suspension of medication for the all, otherwise only available as tablet and not 
 for parenteral use, will definitely meet an unmet medical need in children. likewise, this pfos may 
 also be of interest in some adult patients, who may have difficulties swallowing tablets for various 
 reasons.</p><p>
 the clinical development program for dasatinib in paediatric all includes single-arm studies. imatinib 
 was the first tki to be developed and therefore also the first introduced as targeted therapy in 
 childhood leukemia. the trials included randomization of chemotherapy to treatment with and without 
 imatinib and demonstrated the superiority of the combination therapy. the design of the main and 
 supportive studies introducing dasatinib were single-arm studies because activity of dasatinib against 
 ph+ all in adults and of imatinib against ph+ all in children has been established and hence 
 comparing the activity of dasatinib in combination to chemotherapy alone is acceptable. however, the 
 review and interpretation of previous advice is accepted. it is noticed that in the introduction of 
 imatinib in paediatric all, trials did include a randomization in subgroups between chemotherapy plus 
 imatinib versus chemotherapy alone but were amended to all patients receiving imatinib shortly after 
 favourable results of other paediatric trials with imatinib became known [2]. 
 the patient population included in the dasatinib clinical studies are representative for paediatric ph+ 
 all, with very few patients below the age of 7, and the majority up to the age of 18. patients often 
 present severe leucocytosis and two t-all were included. some more characteristics may influence 
 the prognosis, and treatment progress in all acute leukaemia therapy has emphasized the importance 
 of the cytogenetic aberrations. the secondary genetic abnormalities have not been included in previous 
 advice, nor have data been collected later, e.g. from conventional chromosome analysis, which it is 
 anticipated have been performed in many patients, because the banding technique is a standard 
 analysis. the importance of secondary clonal aberrations was known before 2005 [3], but it is 
 accepted that the information was not collected and consequently not included in the interpretation of 
 results of dasatinib in paediatric all.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the performance status is not commented in reviews on paediatric all (ph-positive and -negative), but the symptoms involves fever, recurrent infections, organomegaly, bleeding, weight loss, bone pain 
 etc [7]. the ps is not mentioned in the criteria for the esphall study, which states that the patient 
 should be eligible for the current local prospective therapeutic study of childhood all (link:</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 51/80</p><p> 
 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct00287105). however, only 1 subject out of 109 screened patients in study ca180372 was excluded due to an active infection. 
 in study ca180372, the 3-year binomial efs rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 66.0% (90% 
 ci: 57.7, 73.7) compared to 49.2% (90% ci: 38.0, 60.4) observed with chemotherapy alone in 
 aieop-bfm 2000 and to 59.1% (90% ci: 51.8, 66.2) observed with continuous imatinib plus 
 chemotherapy in the amended esphall trial in all treated subjects.</p><p>
 regarding the secondary endpoints, the os rate was 91.5% (95% ci: 84.2 - 95.5) at 3 years and the 
 cr was 93.4% (99/106) after consolidation chemotherapy. the results of 3-year dfs are in the same 
 range to results obtained with imatinib.</p><p>
 the inferior cr rate at the end of induction ia vs aieop-bfm 2000 and the amended esphall trial 
 showed a relevant flaw in the ca180372 study design and conduct, as patients undergoing the cr 
 assessment not in the last day of induction ia, as determined, but on the following day, just prior to 
 start induction ib, were not recognised, as per protocol criteria, to be in cr. however, the cr data 
 with one day extension is clinically acceptable, as that extra day is not expected to significantly change 
 the patient’s cr status and allows for the inclusion of cr cases excluded for lack of information. the 
 cr analyses results with one extra day are in line with historical trials, including aieop-bfm 2000 and 
 amended esphall. 
 not all patients were assessed for mrd-negativity by ig/tcr pcr technique, mainly due to poor 
 baseline samples, e.g. no clones identified, no reliable targets, primers failed to amplify target, 
 inadequate volume of bm at dx, etc. the mrd negativity rate assessed by ig/tcr rearrangement was 
 71.7% by the end of consolidation in all treated patients. when this rate was based on the 85 patients 
 with evaluable ig/tcr assessments, the estimate was 89.4%. the mrd-negativity rates at the end of 
 induction and consolidation as measured by flow cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively. 
 the results of the oral suspension, which may be very valuable in the treatment of young children – or 
 perhaps adult patients with ph+ all for reasons like mucositis, swallowing disturbances and more – 
 are presented in 24 patients, who all had the pfos at least once. eight patients are characterized as 
 treated exclusively by pfos. the os rate was 7/8 (87.5%) and efs rate at 3 years was 5/8 (62.5%). 
 the relapse and survival rates in the pfos subgroup of subjects are consistent with the overall 
 population. it may be anticipated that children may use pfos and tablets intermittently. updated data 
 for pfos (only) and pfos (once) treated patients are restricted by low numbers, as expected, but are 
 comparable demographically, and seems to show similar results and clinically meaningful on the 
 endpoint dfs, efs and os.</p><p>
 the study-design did not include previously imatinib-treated children, and the experience in the 
 molecular biological details in such patients is also limited. however, it appears that eight of nine 
 samples from imatinib-treated patients in the cogaall0031 trial showed no bcr-abl1 kinase domain 
 mutation, only one presenting an acquired mutation [9].</p><p>
 it is a concern if long-term outcome is reduced by insufficient dosing, even if the initial effect may still 
 be high response rates and encouraging results. acute leukaemia may in most cases be sensitive to 
 treatment, and it is important to maintain the efficacy by the successive therapies. the results 
 obtained in the main single arm study must be assessed in the context of the data from historical 
 controls. induction of deeper remissions are obtained more rapidly by dasatinib in cml than obtained 
 by imatinib [10]. a survival advantage has not been demonstrated clearly in cml by any tki, but the 
 disease biology in the acute leukaemia is different, and a more rapid and deep remission may be 
 valuable for survival. the efficacy results on dasatinib treatment are interpreted as a contribution to</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 page 52/80</p><p> 
 reduce the need for hsct as second-line treatment in paediatric ph+ all. this implication is very encouraging due to risks for fatal outcome or morbidity by hsct.</p><p>
 in the supportive study ca180204, the 3-year efs rate was 80.8% (95% ci: 70.2, 91.4) in the 52 
 paediatric patients considered evaluable for efficacy and 68.4% (95% ci: 48.3, 88.6) in the 19 
 subjects on continuous dasatinib.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.2">2.5.2.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>the main study ca180372 showed a clinically relevant effect in terms of the 3-year binomial efs rate compared to historical controls treated without dasatinib by the same combination chemotherapy 
 backbone. this was supported by improvements on all relevant secondary endpoints. 
 therefore, clinically relevant efficacy of dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy in newly 
 diagnosed ph+ all was demonstrated in the paediatric population.</p></section><section><header n="2.6">2.6.  
 clinical safety 
 introduction</header><p>dasatinib was combined with 2 different multi-agent chemotherapeutic “backbone” regimens to treat a total of 161 paediatric subjects with ph+ all: the cog aall0031 treatment regimen in study 
 ca180204, and the associazione italiana di ematologia paediatrica - berlin-frankfurt- muenster 
 (aieop-bfm) all 2000 regimen in study ca180372. in study ca180204, the cog aall0031 regimen 
 was combined with dasatinib treatment as a “discontinuous” regimen (ie, 2-week periods of dasatinib 
 treatment followed by 1 to 2 weeks off) in the first cohort and a “continuous” regimen in the second 
 cohort. study ca180372 also used the dasatinib powder for oral suspension (pfos) formulation for 
 subjects who could not swallow tablets. 
 subject disposition, exposure, adverse events (aes), and aes of special interest (aeosis) were 
 analyzed from paediatric subject data pooled from studies ca180204 and ca180372 and are 
 presented by the following categories of dasatinib treatment: 
 • discontinuous dasatinib: n = 35 (exclusively from ca180204) • continuous dasatinib tablet only: n = 102 (20 from ca180204, and 82 from ca180372) • continuous dasatinib: n = 126 (20 from ca180204, and 106 from ca180372) • all treated subjects: n = 161 (55 from ca180204, and 106 from ca180372)</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 countries and is marketed worldwide for these indications in over 60 international countries including 
 the eu, japan, and canada: 
 • dasatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
 • dasatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with ph+ all with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.</p><p>
 • dasatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed ph+ cml in chronic phase. 
 as reported in periodic benefit-risk evaluation report no. 5 (28-jun-2016 through 27-jun-2017), the 
 cumulative number of patients exposed to dasatinib from 28-jun-2006 through 31-mar-2017 is

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety of dasatinib has been characterised in cml patients and appears similar in ph+all in adults and overall in paediatric all. the safety results reported in the main and supportive study did not 
 reveal any new concern in combination with poly-chemotherapy backbone.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 71/80</p><p> 
 dasatinib’s characteristic effect of effusions in pleura or pericardium, observed as a dose-dependent adverse event in adult cml, was not observed in the discontinued treatment or pfos (used) group, 
 and in all grades in 5.9% in the tablet (only) group. considering the complexity of the disease and 
 treatment this result is acceptable. pleural effusions were not observed in childhood cml treatment. 
 the incidence of pleural (or pericardial) effusions is not expected to be underestimated as the clinical 
 monitoring of patients was very thorough.</p><p> 
 there were two studies in a total of 161 paediatric patients with ph+ all in which sprycel was 
 administered in combination with chemotherapy. in study 1, of 55 paediatric patients, 35 received 
 sprycel in combination with chemotherapy on a discontinuous dosing regimen (two weeks on 
 treatment followed by one to two weeks off) and 20 received</p><p>sprycel in combination with 
 chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. in study 2, 106 paediatric patients received sprycel in 
 combination with chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. among the 126 ph+ all paediatric 
 patients treated with sprycel on a continuous dosing regimen, the median duration of therapy was 
 23.6 months (range 1.4 to 33 months) (smpc, section 4.8). 
 adverse reactions reported in the two paediatric studies in which sprycel was administered in 
 combination with chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of sprycel in adults, and 
 expected effects of chemotherapy. of the 126 ph+ all paediatric patients on a continuous dosing 
 regimen, 2 (1.6%) experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation(smpc, section 
 4.8). 
 the adverse events were less frequently reported in the group of patients treated by “discontinuous” 
 dasatinib, compared to the continuous (tablet only) group. this is in line with a dose relation, which 
 therefore add uncertainty to interpretation of results obtained in the group of pfos (used, n=24) and 
 pfos (exclusively, n = 8) group, because the bioavailability is estimated to be 19% less by the 60 
 mg/m2 dose with pfos. a new analysis showed a similar exposure distribution between disease types 
 in both adult and paediatric patients. in addition, the results showed that the intestinal permeability 
 did not change between chronic and acute leukaemia (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).</p><p> 
 dasatinib treatment of paediatric all-patients appears to have limited clinically significant impact on 
 growth and development, but it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to the concomitant 
 treatment of dose-intense combination chemotherapy and without a longer follow-up period.</p><p>
 the adherence to treatment was not optimal, with 25-30% of patients receiving less than 18 dasatinib 
 doses / month. the risk for interaction with concomitant medication and simultaneous aes e.g. 
 mucositis may be partly responsible..</p><p>
 cardiac events had an impact on clinically relevant protocol deviations reported in 40 subjects: 40 
 deviations due to use of concomitant medications with potential to prolong qtc, and two deviations 
 due to subjects with blast-phase cml who were misclassified with ph+ all. inclusion of these two 
 subjects in analysis did not impact interpretability of study results. most of the deviations (30 subjects) 
 were subjects who received short-term prophylactic antibiotics with a macrolide, pentamidine or other 
 prohibited medications, which included droperidol, methadone, haloperidol, domepridone and 
 chlorpromazine. the use of the prohibited concomitant therapy did not impact the efficacy of the 
 treatment with dasatinib plus chemotherapy; none of these subjects had a qtc &gt;450msec.</p><p>the adverse events affect mainly bone-marrow function, skin and mucosa - in particular in the 
 gastrointestinal tract, manifested as vomiting and diarrhoea. sepsis and infections may be a 
 consequence of neutropenia and barrier defect, because contagious infections rarely are observed in 
 leukaemia patients. in addition, all may be serious in grade, and in a few cases lead to treatment 
 discontinuation. the number of all-causality related aes leading to discontinuation was 8.5% (grade 3-</p><p> assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/3851/2019</p><p>
 page 72/80</p><p> 
 5 was 4.9%) in the tablet (only) group, and 2.4 % (1.2 % grade 3-5) were interpreted as dasatinib-related. no discontinuation were registered due to ae, all causality or dasatinib-related in the pfos 
 (once) group in the main study.</p><p>
 as of last data-base lock, 15 (14.2%) treated subjects died. twelve of 15 while on-study deaths 
 occurring post hr3. no deaths were considered related to dasatinib. nine (8.5%) subjects who were in 
 ccr died and 5 (4.7%) subjects died less than 30 days after discontinuation from dasatinib treatment. 
 of the 11 deaths reported in the category of “other,” 9 deaths were attributed primarily to infections. 
 however, for a more meaningful comparison, the paediatric ph+ all population was compared with 
 the adult ph+ all population and with</p><p>the paediatric population studied for the cp-cml indication.</p><p> 
 it is acknowledged that even focusing the analyses in the ph+ all population, the setting is different 
 between children and adults. in the paediatric population dasatinib was used in association with 
 chemotherapy and in the adult population it was used as monotherapy in patients with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior therapies. in the heavily pretreated adult population, the overall safety profile was 
 influenced by the advanced stage of the disease and the use of prior therapies. in the paediatric 
 population it was influenced by the concomitant use of chemotherapy. dasatinib’s safety profile is 
 notably consistent across these groups, being in general more favourable in the paediatric population, 
 namely with less pleural effusion and peripheral edema. there is some more abdominal pain (maybe 
 related to age groups) and much more febrile neutropenia (in probable relation with the all backbone 
 chemotherapy treatment). nevertheless, in general, the safety profile of dasatinib in the paediatric 
 ph+ all study population was comparable to that in the adult trials. 
 the adverse events observed in treatment of acute leukaemia may be related. it is also noted in tables 
 of aeosi and sae that patients may have more than one event within a class. a trend has been 
 observed towards more frequent saes in the age-group 12-18 years compared to the youngest 
 patients, below the age of 7 years.</p><p>
 in paediatric patients with ph+ all treated with dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy, cbcs 
 should be performed prior to the start of each block of chemotherapy and as clinically indicated. during 
 the consolidation blocks of chemotherapy, cbcs should be performed every 2 days until recovery 
 (smpc, section 4.4).</p><p>
 in paediatric trials of sprycel in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ph+ all paediatric 
 patients after a maximum of 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events associated with 
 bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. this case was a grade 1 osteopenia 
 (smpc, section 4.4). 
 in the paediatric all studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known 
 profile for laboratory parameters in adults, within the context of an acute leukaemia patient receiving a 
 background chemotherapy regimen (smpc, section 4.8). 
 the introduction of the oral suspension, pfos, in all will be a great treatment advantage in order to 
 dispense the medication to a young child. results on safety were pooled with tablet treated patients, 
 and do not indicate specific safety issues or adverse events.</p></section><section><header n="2.6.2">2.6.2.

 chemotherapy. 
 the survival rate among subjects with ph+ all still lags behind most other cytogenetic subgroups in 
 paediatric all. until recently, hsct in first complete remission offered the best opportunity for long-
 term efs for children with ph+ all, with an improvement in disease free survival of up to 65% and os 
 72%. this strategy is limited by the availability of a suitably matched donor, by the risk of post-
 transplant–related morbidity and mortality and by relapses after hsct, particularly in those who are 
 mrd positive prior to transplantation. paediatric patients with no suitable donor for hsct have an even 
 more critical unmet need for disease management.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.

 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>for cp-cml a pfos dose of 90 mg/m2 has been proposed and endorsed by chmp, but bioequivalence will be investigated in a pk window study in cp-cml conducted post-approval. as the pk, including 
 bioavailability, of dasatinib appear to be comparable across disease status, the pfos dose used in cp-
 cml has also been endorsed for the ph+ all indication. the mah was committed to provide the results 
 of this pk-window study post-approval. in relation to this it needs to stressed that although (based on 
 the mechanistic understanding, the analysis of efficacy versus gi toxicity, formulation and patient 
 populations, and the analysis of pk in the different patient populations) the pbpk model is considered 
 to provide reassuring data on the extrapolation of pk across the patient populations, the pbpk model is 
 not fully validated. the chmp recommended the mah to confirm (post-approval) that the post-
 approval analysis will be conducted to demonstrate that the pbpk model adequately captures the 
 effects of chemotherapy on absorption in line with the existing guideline on reporting and qualification 
 of pbpk models..</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.
