 smpc and pl 
 dasatinib exposure variability is higher under fasted 
 conditions (47% cv) compared to light-fat meal (39% cv) 
 and high-fat meal (32% cv) conditions. based on the 
 patient population pk analysis, variability in dasatinib 
 exposure was estimated to be mainly due to inter-occasion 
 variability in bioavailability (44% cv) and, to a lesser 
 extent, due to inter-individual variability in bioavailability 
 and inter-individual variability in clearance (30% and 32% 
 cv, respectively). the random inter-occasion variability in 
 exposure is not expected to affect the cumulative exposure 
 and efficacy or safety.

 smpc and pl 
 studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity of 
 dasatinib. based on human experience, dasatinib is 
 suspected to cause congenital malformations including 
 neural tube defects, and harmful pharmacological effects 
 on the foetus when administered during pregnancy. 
  sprycel should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
 clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
 dasatinib. if sprycel is used during pregnancy, the patient 
 must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus.
  women of childbearing potential must be advised to use 
 effective contraception during treatment.

   c.i.4 - variations related to significant modifications 
 of the spc due in particular to new quality, pre-

 continued high rates of cccyr along with higher rates of 
 mmr which are expected to translate into long term clinical 
 benefit of dasatinib over imatinib. it is noted that the time 
 to achieving a cccyr and mmr was faster with dasatinib. 
 also, transformation to accelerated or blast phase occurred 
 in fewer dasatinib-treated subjects compared with imatinib-
 treated subjects. as expected pfs and os data remain 
 immature. high rates of pfs and os that were comparable 
 across both treatment groups were observed, although 
 fewer progressions were observed in the dasatinib group 
 compared with the imatinib.  
  the safety profile is still acceptable; it is manageable and 
 comparable to that of imatinib. no new concerns have been 
 identified with the 48 month follow up. 
  the summary of product characteristics has been updated 
 to include the results of this 48-month update.

 the 36-month update of study ca180056. 
  submission of the 36 months results from study ca180056 
 showed continued high rates of cccyr along with higher 
 rates of mmr which are expected to translate into long 
 term clinical benefit of dasatinib over imatinib. it is noted 
 that the time to achieving a cccyr and mmr was faster 
 with dasatinib. also, transformation to accelerated or blast 
 phase occurred in fewer dasatinib-treated subjects 
 compared with imatinib-treated subjects. as expected pfs 
 and os data remain immature. high rates of pfs and os 
 that were comparable across both treatment groups were 
 observed, although fewer progressions were observed in 
 the dasatinib group compared with the imatinib.  
  the safety profile is still acceptable; it is manageable and 
 comparable to that of imatinib. no new concerns have been 
 identified with the 36 month follow up. 
  the mah will continue to provide yearly updates in order to 
 obtain longer follow-up in terms of overall survival.

 in this application, the mah submitted the results of 5 
 years of follow-up of a dose optimisation study ca180034 
 in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib that supported 
 the approval of dasatinib at 100 mg qd in patients with 
 chronic phase cml and at 140 mg qd in advanced disease 
 cml and in ph+ all.
  the results from this 5 year follow-up in ca180034 confirm 
 the findings of earlier analyses that patients achieved 
 clinical benefit on therapy with dasatinib. treatment with 
 100 mg qd continues to provide efficacy similar to the 
 initially approved dose of 70 mg bid. 
  the safety analysis from ca180034 and the pooled safety 
 analysis confirmed the tolerability of dasatinib. 
  as a consequence, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the smpc 
 and the package leaflet have been udpated to reflect the 
 findings from the 5 year update. 
  the package leaflet was also updated to ensure that the

 and pl 
 based upon the data that have become available since the 
 granting of the initial marketing authorisation, the chmp 
 considers that the benefit-risk balance of sprycel remains 
 positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
 monitored for the following reasons:
   - 
 sprycel has been approved based on surrogate 
 efficacy endpoints and further surveillance of the mortality 
 rate is required. 
  - 
 the additional issue of pulmonary arterial 
 hypertension has been identified during the period covered 
 by this renewal and requires updates of the product 
 information and risk minimisation activities.
  - 
 the chmp decided that the mah should continue to 
 submit yearly psurs.
   therefore, based upon the safety profile of sprycel, which 
 requires the submission of yearly psurs, the chmp 
 concluded that the mah should submit one additional 
 renewal application in 5 years time.

 effect of omeprazole 40 mg on the pharmacokinetics of 
 dasatinib in healthy subjects.
  a total of 14 subjects entered the study and received study 
 medication. thirteen (13) subjects completed the study. a 
 single oral dose of 100 mg dasatinib was administered to 
 subjects in the morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. on 
 days 1 and 6 in a fasted condition. omeprazole was 
 administered once daily in the morning at approximately 
 11:00 a.m. on days 2 through 6 in a fasted condition. 
  in a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 
 100 mg dose of sprycel 22 hours following a 4-day, 40-mg 
 omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the auc of 
 dasatinib by 43% and the cmax of dasatinib by 42%.

 same active substance and excipients in the same 
 proportional amounts as currently approved sprycel 20 mg, 
 50 mg, 70 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets.
  the new strengths (sprycel film coated tablets 80 mg and 
 140 mg) are aimed to allow a reduced pill burden and 
 support concordance with approved therapy. the 80 mg 
      page 20/28 film coated tablet will allow patients to take the approved dose reduction of 80 mg qd in the case of neutropenia or 
 thrombocytopenia and the 140 mg film coated tablet will 
 allow patients to have flexibility of a one-unit daily dose, in 
 line with the updated posology of a starting dose of 140 mg

 in this type ii variation, the marketing authorisation holder 
 (mah) provided up to 36 months of follow-up safety data in 
 clinical studies. the results of updated analyses confirm 
 initial findings of a dose of 100 mg qd in chronic phase 
 cml and use of 140 mg qd in advanced phase cml and 
 ph+all. in updated analyses in the overall population of 
 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects with up to 36 months of 
 follow-up, no new safety signals were identified compared 
 with analyses performed with 24 months of follow-up in 
 this clinical trial population.
   in line with 36-month follow-up data from clinical trials, 
 section 4.8 of the summary of product characteristics 
 (spc) was updated to add &quot;hypoalbuminemia&quot; as a rare 
 event, to change the frequency of &quot;cholecystitis&quot; from 
 &quot;rare&quot; to &quot;uncommon and to add &quot;genital swelling&quot; under 
 the footnote regarding &quot;superficial oedema&quot;.
       page 21/28  in addition to the update from the studies, the safety data from the global marketed use of dasatinib included in the 
 most recent periodic safety update report concludes that 
 the safety profile of dasatinib remains similar to the profile 
 established during clinical trials. 
   however, the following adverse drug reactions reported 
 during the post-marketing period have been added to 
 section 4.8 of the spc with a frequency &quot;not known&quot;: atrial 
 fibrillation/atrial flutter, thrombosis/embolism (including 
 pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis), interstitial 
 lung disease, and fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage. the 
 package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
   overall, review of the current data does not suggest that 
 these post-marketing experiences have a clinically 
 important impact that could change the risk-benefit profile 
 of dasatinib.

 starting dose. however, due to the limitations of this 
 clinical study, caution is recommended when administering 
 sprycel to patients with hepatic impairment.
   the effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose 
 pharmacokinetics of dasatinib was assessed in 8

 embryofoetal development studies, dasatinib likewise 
 induced embryolethality with associated decreases in 
 litter size in rats, as well as foetal skeletal alterations 
 in both rats and rabbits. these effects occurred at 
 doses that did not produce maternal toxicity,
