 information on the development program</header><p>sprycel (dasatinib, bristol-myers squibb [bms]-354825) is a potent oral inhibitor of multiple oncogenic kinases and is approved for use in the european union (eu), united states (us) and other 
 countries for the treatment of adult subjects with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), 
 advanced (accelerated and blast) phase cml, or philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic 
 leukemia (ph+ all) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. dasatinib has also been approved in 
 the eu, us, and other countries for treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase 
 cml. the recommended starting dosage for chronic phase cml is 100 mg administered orally once 
 daily (qd).</p><p>the recommended starting dosage for accelerated phase cml, myeloid or lymphoid blast 
 phase cml, or ph+ all is 140 mg qd.</p><p>
 this submission includes results for the pediatric study ca180204 (eudract number 2010 022946-25) 
 and is being submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation (ec) no. 1901/2006. a final clinical 
 study report (csr) is included in the submission and presents subject disposition, exposure, safety, 
 and efficacy data. study ca180204 started in 15-jul-2008 and completed on 05-mar-2015.</p><p>
 ca180204 is a completed, open-label, multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study conducted and 
 sponsored by the children’s oncology group (cog, aall0622) assessing the addition of dasatinib 
 administered qd to a multi agent chemotherapeutic “backbone” in children with newly diagnosed ph+ 
 al). this study builds on the experience of cog aall0031, which incorporated imatinib, a tyrosine 
 kinase inhibitor (tki) targeting bcr-abl, into an intensive chemotherapy backbone for the same 
 population. compared with aall0031, the treatment plan of ca180204 substituted dasatinib for 
 imatinib, and eliminated radiotherapy for the great majority of children.</p><p>
 preliminary data from this ca180204 trial prompted development of study ca180372, in which 
 dasatinib is added to a ph+ all chemotherapy regimen believed to be less intense than the aall0031 
 chemotherapy backbone. the chemotherapy used in study ca180372 is based on the associazione 
 italiana di ematologia pediatrica - berlin-frankfurt-muenster all 2000 (aieop bfm 2000) study and 
 amended european intergroup study on post-induction treatment of philadelphia positive acute 
 lymphoblastic leukemia (esphall). enrollment in study ca180204 was stopped on 3 feb-2012 prior to 
 reaching enrollment target when study ca180372 opened for enrollment of the same patient 
 population in cog.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.

 description</header><p>study ca180204 (cog aall0622) is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm, phase 2 study in children and young adults with newly diagnosed all. a primary objective of this study was to determine the 
 feasibility and toxicity of an intensified chemotherapeutic regimen incorporating dasatinib for treatment 
 of children and young adults with ph+ all. feasibility was defined as the ability to safely add dasatinib 
 to the aall0031 chemotherapy backbone either when given discontinuously (in 2-week periods 
 followed by 1 to 2 weeks off) or continuously. an additional primary objective was to estimate the 3-
 year efs for standard-risk ph+ all subjects receiving dasatinib at the final chosen dose and intensive 
 chemotherapy plus intensified tki therapy. a benchmark efs of 60% (the outcome of subjects 
 receiving matched related bone marrow transplants from a large multicenter retrospective analysis), 
 was used to evaluate outcome in this study.</p><p>
 a design schema is presented in figure 1.1-1. subjects entered ca180204 on or before day 15 of 
 induction therapy (either a 3- or 4-drug standard induction or on a dana farber cancer institute 
 [dfci] childhood all consortium trial) and received dasatinib on days 15 - 28 of induction. following 
 induction, all subjects received 2 blocks of consolidation. subjects in cohort 1 (safety phase) received 
 dasatinib at 60 mg/m
 2 daily (dl0) during the first 2 weeks of each 3- to 4-week post-induction treatment block (discontinuous dasatinib). if this dose was well tolerated, the subjects in cohort 2 
 received continuous dasatinib treatment at 60 mg/m
 2/dose daily for the entire treatment block. (note: if 60 mg/m
 2 daily were not well tolerated, subjects in cohort 2 would have received continuous dasatinib at 48 mg/m
 2 daily [dl-1]). subjects were enrolled into cohort 2 once enrollment into cohort 1 was stopped. subjects in cohort 1 (discontinuous dasatinib) received a total of 70 weeks of 
 dasatinib. subjects in cohort 2 (continuous dasatinib) received a total of 128 weeks of dasatinib. see 
 figure 1.1-2 for schematic of safety phase. 
 quantification of residual disease at end of induction and end of consolidation was used to classify 
 subjects into risk groups. all high-risk subjects and all standard-risk subjects with matched sibling 
 donors were urged to proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) at the end of consolidation 
 block 2 on asct0431 or a successor cog transplant trial. all subjects who did not proceed to hsct 
 continued on ca180204 and received chemotherapy plus dasatinib.</p><p> page 5/22</p></section><section><header>figure 1.1-1: ca180204 (aall0622) design schema</header><p>*dasatinib was given in first 14 days of each chemotherapy block for cohort 1 and was given continuously during each chemotherapy block for cohort 2. 
 #remainder of ca180204 (aall0622) chemotherapy followed aall0031-cohort 5 backbone chemotherapy, but with dasatinib 
 substituted for imatinib. see section 4.0 of the protocol for treatment details.

 48 mg/m
 2 daily (dl-1). an additional 6 subjects were then accrued at this lower dose level (dl-1). if ≥ 5/6 subjects safely completed intensification block 1 at a given dose level, cohort 2 opened at dl0, 
 with the dose given continuously. when a safe dose level was established, the efficacy phase of the 
 trial opened to accrual. subjects treated at the established dose level during the safety phase were 
 included in the analyses for the efficacy phase.</p></section><section><header>objectives</header><p>primary objectives were: • to determine the feasibility and toxicity of an intensified chemotherapeutic regimen that incorporates dasatinib for treatment of children, adolescents, and young adults (up to age 30) 
 with ph+ all. 
 • to determine whether the intensification of tki through the addition of dasatinib in induction (days 15-28) and substitution of dasatinib for imatinib during post-induction therapy, in the 
 context of intensive cytotoxic therapy (according to aall0031) and a good early response to 
 therapy, will lead to a 3-year efs of at least 60% in subjects with ph+ all. 
 secondary objectives were: 
 • to determine whether the addition of dasatinib during induction therapy (days 15-28) will decrease levels of mrd present at end of induction therapy as compared with cog aall0031. 
 • to determine whether early intensified tki therapy (ie, addition of dasatinib on days 15 through 28 of induction) will lower end-consolidation mrd levels as compared to subjects 
 on cog aall0031 that received imatinib in consolidation blocks 1 and 2 (cohorts 3-5).

 and young adults with ph+ all. feasibility was defined as the ability to safely add dasatinib to the 
 aall0031 chemotherapy backbone either when given discontinuously (in 2-week periods followed by 1 
 to 2 weeks off) or continuously. feasibility of administering dasatinib in combination with cytotoxic 
 chemotherapy was assessed by examining 1) adverse event (ae) experience, 2) delays in 
 administering the combination therapy (the occurrence of delays in each reporting period of greater 
 than 14 days due to aes was captured on case report forms), 3) impact on mrd levels at the end of 
 induction and end of consolidation block 2, and 4) effect on efs.</p></section><section><header>efficacy primary endpoint:</header><p>an additional primary objective was to estimate the 3-year efs for standard-risk ph+ all subjects receiving dasatinib and intensive chemotherapy plus intensified tki 
 therapy. efs was defined as the time from entry on study until an event. events for efs were defined 
 as any first of the following: 1) induction failure, 2) relapse at any site, 3) secondary malignancy, and 
 4) death. a bone marrow aspirate was utilized in determining efs. a bone marrow assessment was 
 performed for cytology, conventional cytogenetics, and mrd assessment. a bone marrow aspirate was 
 to be performed as clinically indicated if relapse was suspected in order to document an event for the 
 primary endpoint of this study.</p></section><section><header>statistical considerations</header><p>safety analyses were based on all treated subjects (all subjects who received at least 1 dose of dasatinib) and results are presented by cohort and across cohorts. the efficacy sample included all 
 treated subjects with the exception of subjects considered ineligible based on study chair review, and 
 the pediatric efficacy sample included all treated pediatric subjects (&lt; 18 years) with the exception of 
 subjects considered ineligible based on study chair review. 
 the primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year efs rate in standard-risk ph+ all subjects in cohort 2. the 
 primary efficacy objective was to determine if in this group a 3-year efs rate of 60% could be 
 achieved. the rate of 3-year efs was estimated from the kaplan-meier curve. a 1-sided 95% wald 
 confidence interval (ci) for 3-year efs rate was constructed. a lower limit of the 1-sided 95% ci 
 greater than 55% was evidence of this combination therapy being effective, but it should be taken into 
 consideration that the sample size assumed in the protocol was higher than the actual sample size. the 
 overall 3-year efs rate for the combined groups of standard- and high-risk subjects in cohort 2 was 
 also estimated.</p><p>
 secondary endpoints were 1) to determine whether the addition of dasatinib during induction therapy 
 (days 15-28) decreases levels of mrd present at end of induction therapy as compared with cog 
 aall0031, and 2) to determine whether early intensified tki therapy (ie, addition of dasatinib on days 
 15 through 28 of induction) lowers end-consolidation mrd levels as compared with subjects on cog 
 aall0031 that received imatinib in consolidation blocks 1 and 2 (cohorts 3-5). a total of 72 subjects 
 on cohorts 1-5 of study aall0031 had end of induction mrd data of which 71% were mrd positive 
 (mrd &gt; 0.01%). in addition, the mrd positive rate (at the 0.01% level) following consolidation was</p><p>page 8/22</p><p>
 around 16%, in cohorts 3-5 of aall0031. a 1-sided, 2 sample z-test of proportions was performed (alpha=5%) to compare the proportion of mrd positive subjects from cohort 2 efficacy sample at end 
 of induction to that in study aall0031, and a 1-sample z-test of proportions (alpha=5%, 1-sided test) 
 was used to compare the mrd positive rate among subjects in cohort 2 with mrd data at end of 
 consolidation block 2 to 16%. 
 kaplan-meier plots and estimates of os were provided based on standard-risk cohort 2 subjects as 
 well as by cohort and across cohorts. bcr-abl mutation status was analyzed at baseline and at 
 disease progression or relapse for subjects that progress or relapse. changes from baseline in height 
 and weight z-scores (standardized based on world health organization selected pediatric parameters) 
 at different time periods (baseline, year 1, year 2, year 3, and beyond year 3) were tabulated.</p></section><section><header>results</header></section><section><header>demographics and baseline disease characteristics - all treated subjects</header><p>a total of 63 subjects were enrolled and 62 were treated (40 in cohort 1 and 22 in cohort 2). as indicated above, accrual was less than originally planned because enrollment was stopped when study 
 ca180372 opened for enrollment of this patient population as agreed with regulatory authorities. 
 overall, more male subjects were treated compared with female subjects (67.7% vs 32.3%, 
 respectively), and the majority of subjects in this study were white (71.0%) (table 1.2.1-1). the 
 median age at time of informed consent in all treated subjects was 8.0 years (range 1 - 27 years) in 
 cohort 1 and 10.0 years (range 1 - 27 years) in cohort 2. at the age of diagnosis, 3 subjects were &gt; 1 
 - &lt; 2 years, and 7 subjects were 
 ≥ 18 years. the remaining 52 subjects were diagnosed between the ages of 2 and &lt; 18 years. 
 the median time from initial diagnosis of all to the first dasatinib dosing date was 17 days overall 
 (table 1.2.1-2). the majority (93.5%) of subjects had b-precursor phenotype. the median white blood 
 cell (wbc) and platelet counts, and the median % blasts in bone marrow at baseline were: 
 o wbc:</p><p>
 28.6 x 10
 3/µl (range 2.0 - 700 x 103/µl) o platelet:</p><p>
 64.0 x 10
 3/µl (range 5 - 45000* x 103/µl) o blasts in bone marrow:</p><p>88.0% (range 38% - 100%) 
 *note: post database lock, this single value of 45000 was assumed to be a data entry error. removal of the value of 45000 leads to the following results for platelets: 
 − cohort 1: n=39, mean=90.9, median=65, (min, max)=(5, 372), (q1, q3)=(29, 101), standard deviation=92.41 
 − cohort 2: n=12, mean=96.3, median=51, (min, max)=(11, 254), (q1, q3)=(23, 176), standard deviation=87.05 
 − total: n=51, mean=92.2, median=63, (min, max)=5, 372), (q1, q3)=(26, 134), standard deviation=90.35 
 most subjects had central nervous system (cns) 1 status (absence of blasts on cytospin preparation of 
 cerebrospinal fluid), but 4 subjects (6.5%, 3 in cohort 1 and 1 in cohort 2) had cns3 status at 
 enrollment. no subjects were reported with testicular disease (or not applicable).</p><p>page 9/22</p><p>page 10/22</p></section><section><header>efficacy results</header><p>in the protocol for ca180204, the expected number of standard-risk ph+ all cohort 2 subjects (ie, the group on which the primary efficacy analysis is based) was expected to be 73; however, due to 
 early closure of the study in order to open the successor study ca180372, the actual number was 17. 
 the sample sizes for efficacy analyses in cohort 2 are considerably lower than expected per protocol 
 due to the early termination of enrollment. this negatively affects the power of statistical tests and the 
 precision of estimates; confidence intervals will be substantially wider than under the expected 
 numbers of subjects. therefore, inferences are also based on efficacy information from cohort 1 
 (discontinuous dosing) even though exposure to dasatinib was considerably less. 
 no statistical comparisons were performed between cohorts 1 and 2. these subgroups were not 
 randomized; rather, cohort 2 subjects were enrolled after it was concluded that toxicity levels were 
 acceptable in cohort 1 subjects and enrollment into that cohort was closed.</p></section><section><header>3-year event-free survival  cohort 2 subjects:</header><p>the primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year efs rate in standard-risk cohort 2 subjects. the proportion was estimated from the corresponding efs kaplan-meier curve (figure 5.1-1). 
 the primary efficacy objective was to determine if in this group a 3-year efs rate of 60% could be 
 achieved. the protocol states further that if the lower limit of the ci would be greater than 55%, the 
 combination therapy should be deemed effective. the estimated 3-year efs rate was 70.1%. however, 
 the lower limit of the 1-sided 95% ci was 51.8% (table 5.1-1). at the 3-year timepoint, a total of 5 
 events had been reported, 1 subject had been censored, and 11 subjects remained at risk. 
 in cohort 2 subjects (any risk, efficacy sample [secondary endpoint]), the estimated 3-year efs rate 
 was 66.3% (n = 21) with a lower limit of the 1-sided 95% of 49.4% (table 5.1-1). at the 3-year 
 timepoint, a total of 7 events had been reported, 1 subject had been censored, and 13 subjects 
 remained at risk. 
 overall for subjects in cohort 2 (any risk, efficacy sample), one subject relapsed with all during 
 study treatment (in cns, after 21.7 months), and another subject developed secondary acute 
 myelogenous leukemia (aml). two additional subjects experienced relapse after completion of protocol</p><p>page 11/22</p><p>
 treatment. of the 7 subjects who had been withdrawn for elective bmt, relapse was reported in 3 subjects and death related to graft-versus-host-disease (gvhd) in 1 subject.

 treatment. follow-up in subjects for the measurement of growth-related aspects of dasatinib in 
 combination with chemotherapy continues.</p></section><section><header>mutation analysis</header><p>in all treated subjects who progressed or relapsed, 14/20 (70.0%) had mutation data at baseline and at the time of progression/relapse; of these subjects, 1 (7.1%) subject was reported with a mutation

 with a q252h mutation identified at baseline developed a dasatinib-resistant t315i mutation on study, 
 and one other subject developed a previously-uncharacterized mutation.</p></section><section><header>overall efficacy conclusion</header><p>as concluded by the mah, it can be endorsed that the efficacy of dasatinib in preventing relapse of ph+ all during study treatment was shown. only 2 subjects (both cohorts, any risk) showed progression 
 during study therapy, one in bone marrow and one in cns, and one additional subject developed 
 secondary aml (possibly related to etoposide).the 3-year efs rate was 79.6% in the efficacy sample 
 (80.8% in the pediatric efficacy sample), with a lower limit of 95% ci of 70.9% (71.8% in the 
 pediatric subjects). most subjects with disease relapse prior to 3 years had electively discontinued for 
 bmt (6/18) or after completion of therapy (3 subjects). of 44 subjects without elective transplant, 9 
 relapsed after 3 years (20.5%, including 1 who discontinued study treatment at maintenance 1), but 
 observation is continuing. 
 minimal residual disease assessments, although limited by study size, support the efficacy of dasatinib. 
 at the end of induction, only 41.4% of subjects (combined cohorts 1 and 2, any risk, efficacy sample) 
 (39.2% in the pediatric efficacy sample) were mrd-positive compared with 70.8% in aall0031. this 
 reduction in mrd-positive rate may be attributed to addition of continuous dasatinib in weeks 3-4 of 
 induction therapy. at the end of consolidation, only 10.5% of subjects were mrd-positive (9.6% in the 
 pediatric subjects); this reduction in mrd-positive rate, although not statistically significant compared 
 with the hypothesized 16% rate, is consistent with the higher potency of dasatinib compared with 
 imatinib.</p><p>page 14/22</p></section><section><header>safety results overview of safety</header><p>a summary of safety findings (deaths, serious adverse events [saes], aes leading to discontinuation, aes, and aes of special interest) is provided in this section for all treated subjects. refer to the 
 ca180204 csr for safety findings in all pediatric treated subjects.</p><p> 
 two subjects were reported with dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) during the safety phase. in one 
 subject, the dlt was due to severe myelosuppression during intensification block 1, and was one of 
 the events leading to the modification of the chemotherapy backbone (amendment 2). in the second 
 subject, grade 4 sensory neuropathy was reported during consolidation block 1. a third subject 
 developed prolonged grade 3 leukoencephalopathy (per study principal investigator communication; 
 also see narrative for subject ca180204-298-791948) during intensification block 2 after receiving 
 high-dose [hd] methotrexate [mtx]. this and additional subjects with neurotoxicity led to amendment 
 5 whereby subjects on study at that time subsequently received a single dose of intrathecal (it) mtx 
 (age-based dosing) rather than triple intrathecal therapy (itt) on day 29 of induction, and the 
 scheduled dose of itt on day 1 of consolidation was eliminated.</p></section><section><header>disposition and exposure</header><p>a total of 34 (54.8%) subjects completed study treatment. the primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment are provided in table 4.1-1. the most common reason in both cohorts for not 
 completing study treatment was bone marrow transplant (bmt; n = 11, 27.5% in cohort 1; n = 7, 
 31.8% in cohort 2). of these 18 subjects, 5 were also reported as enrolled in another cog study. only 
 2 subjects were reported to have disease progression during the protocol treatment.</p><p>
 a total of 18 (29.0%) subjects did not continue in the study.</p><p>reasons for not continuing in the study 
 included: lost to follow-up, enrollment onto another cog study with therapeutic intent (for bmt or 
 following relapse), death, and the special reason for 1 subject considered ineligible after having started 
 treatment. 
 the median duration of dasatinib therapy from first through last dasatinib dose date was 30.9 months 
 (table 4.1-2). the expected number of months of actual dasatinib treatment was 16.1 (70 weeks) in 
 cohort 1 (discontinuous dosing) and 29.4 (128 weeks) in cohort 2 (continuous dosing). the recorded 
 median number of months of actual dasatinib treatment was 15.0 in cohort 1 and 26.2 in cohort 2.</p><p>
 a delay &gt;14 days were reported in only 14 of 770 treatment blocks in 62 treated subjects.</p><p>page 15/22</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>a total of 8 (12.9%) deaths were reported with 4 deaths in each cohort (refer to table 7.2-1 of the ca180204 csr).</p><p>none of the deaths was reported within 30 days of the last dose of treatment, and</p><p>page 16/22</p><p>
 none was related to dasatinib treatment. overall, 3 deaths were due to disease progression, and the remaining 5 were due to ‘other cause’ (cardiac failure, acute critical upper airway obstruction, mll-
 rearranged therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, injuries resulting from being hit by a school bus, 
 infection due to complication of graft vs host disease).</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events</header><p>the source for capturing saes reported during this study was adverse event expedited reporting system (adeers) forms. events assigned as the ‘primary reason’ for saes are listed in table 4.3-1. 
 some inconsistencies were noted between the adeers forms and cog ae database. because adeers 
 are submitted rapidly and may not have been revised based on subsequent information, the cog ae 
 database was considered to be the definitive source for ae information including dates, severity, and 
 relatedness. these inconsistencies were minor with no impact on overall safety results. 
 a total of 29 (46.8%) subjects were reported with saes, regardless of relationship to dasatinib (cohort 
 1, n = 19/40 [47.5%]; cohort 2, n = 10/22 [45.5%]) (refer to table 7.3-1 of the ca180204 csr). 
 drug-related saes were reported in 14 (35.0%) subjects in cohort 1 and in 7 (31.8%) subjects in 
 cohort 2. most drug-related saes were grade 3/4. none led to study discontinuation.

 the majority of subjects had at least 1 ae assessed by the investigator as related to dasatinib: cohort 1, 32/40 (80.0%); cohort 2, 20/22 (90.9%); all treated, 52/62 (83.9%) (table 4.5-1; table 4.5-2).

 adverse events of special interest include fluid retention (including the subcategories of superficial 
 edema, pleural effusion, and other fluid-related endpoints [pericardial effusion, generalized edema, 
 chf/cardiac 
 dysfunction, 
 pulmonary 
 edema, 
 pulmonary 
 hypertension]), 
 pulmonary 
 arterial 
 hypertension (pah), hemorrhage (gastrointestinal [gi] bleeding, cns bleeding, and other 
 hemorrhage), selected cardiac events, arterial ischemic events, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, 
 myalgias/arthralgias, and rash. these events are described in this section. 
 dasatinib-related fluid retention-related aes were infrequent in both cohorts (table 4.6-1; table 4.6-
 2). severe events (grade 3/4) reported included one subject in cohort 1 with generalized edema and 
 one subject in cohort 2 with superficial edema. no cases of dasatinib-related pleural effusion, 
 pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, or pah were reported.</p><p>
 drug-related hemorrhage was reported in 3 subjects, reported as an sae (gi bleeding) in 1 subject 
 (ca204-117-801809), but all were considered severe: cohort 1 had 2 subjects, one with gi bleeding 
 and 1 with “other hemorrhage”; cohort 2 had 1 subject with “other hemorrhage” (table 4.6-1). other 
 aes of interest that had an overall frequency of ≥5% in all treated subjects were nausea/vomiting

 in cohort 1 and 1 subject in cohort 2), reported as an sae (gi bleeding) in 1 subject, but all were 
 considered severe</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical aspects</header><p>the conclusion and discussion as provided by the mah is fully acceptable. it is agreed that despite early termination of this study (in favor of ca180372, an international study in the same clinical 
 setting), study ca180204 was able to achieve multiple key aims. a total of 62 subjects were treated, 
 of whom 40 received dasatinib on the discontinuous regimen (70 weeks) and 22 received dasatinib on 
 the continuous regimen (128 weeks).</p><p>
 the safety and tolerability of dasatinib were demonstrated when added to an intensive chemotherapy 
 regimen for the treatment for ph+ all in pediatric subjects. only two subjects discontinued due to an</p><p>page 22/22</p><p>
 ae (not dasatinib-related) and the 2 dlts (which prompted safety-related amendments) were not dasatinib-related. discontinuation for elective bmt was the most common reason (18 subjects) for not 
 completing protocol-defined treatment. 
 disease control using dasatinib with chemotherapy was achieved, with overall 3-year efs rate of 
 79.6% (80.8% in the pediatric sample), meeting the pre-defined target. recurrence during treatment 
 was very uncommon (2/62, 3.2%). most relapses within 3 years were in subjects discontinued at week 
 12 for allogeneic transplant; longer dasatinib exposure appears warranted in this setting.</p><p>
 safety and efficacy data in this study support a favorable benefit risk profile for dasatinib on the 
 continuous schedule in combination with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy in pediatric subjects with 
 ph+ all.</p><p>
 as stated by the mah, the submitted study is part of a clinical development program and a variation 
 application consisting of the full relevant paediatric data package is expected to be submitted during 
 the first half of 2018.</p><p>
 it is considered that the data included in this submission do not at this time influence the benefit-risk 
 balance for sprycel and currently do not require further updates of the sprycel summary of product
