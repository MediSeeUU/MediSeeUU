 3.1. 
 introduction</header><p>sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the bcr-abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c-kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and 
 pdgfβ receptor. the marketing authorisation (ma) was granted in november 2006 for the treatment 
 of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesylate, and also for the treatment of adults with 
 philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) and lymphoid blast 
 cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.</p><p>
 at the time of the chmp in september 2006, the marketing authorisation holder (mah) made 
 commitments to provide the final clinical study reports for a number of studies which were ongoing at 
 the time (see below). the data submitted refer to follow-up measures 008, 008.1, 009 and 011. as 
 these updates provide further information relevant for prescribers, the mah has submitted the data as 
 a part of a variation application to amend the currently approved spc.</p><p>
 the variation is based on 24 months of follow-up data from five phase 2 studies in subjects with 
 chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast and lymphoid blast phases cml and ph+ all resistant or 
 intolerant to imatinib. the variation aims to update the safety and efficacy sections in the product 
 information (i.e. section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1) with the results of these five studies. the package leaflet 
 has been amended accordingly.</p><p>
 the studies for which updated data have been received: 
 • ca18005 – a open label phase 2 study, ongoing in 80 centers worldwide, enrollment closed. testing 70 mg bid dasatinib in subjects with accelerated phase cml resistant or 
 intolerant to imatinib;</p><p>
 • ca18006 – a open label phase 2 study, ongoing in 47 centers worldwide, enrollment closed. testing 70 mg bid dasatinib in subjects with myeloid blast phase cml resistant or 
 intolerant to imatinib;</p><p>
 • ca180013 – a open label phase 2 study, ongoing in 90 centers worldwide, enrollment closed. testing 70 mg bid dasatinib in subjects with chronic phase cml resistant or 
 intolerant to imatinib;</p><p>
 • ca180015 – a open label phase 2 study, ongoing in 28 centers worldwide, enrollment closed. testing 70 mg bid dasatinib in subjects with lymphoid blast phase cml resistant or 
 intolerant to imatinib. and; also in ph+ all subjects ongoing in 25 centers worldwide;</p><p>
 • ca180017 - a randomised open label phase 2 study, ongoing in 107 centers worldwide, enrollment closed. testing 70 mg bid dasatinib vs. imatinib 400 mg bid in subjects with 
 chronic phase cml resistant to imatinib 400 mg to 600 mg daily.</p><p>
 in this variation application the data are presented separately by phase of disease as each phase 
 represents a different patient population with different baseline characteristics and prognosis.</p><p>further, the mah has updated annex iib to include a reference to the pharmacovigilance system 
 (version 2.5) and the risk management plan (version 3.0) agreed with the chmp. in addition, the 
 mah have implemented some minor editorial changes in the spc and annex ii and took the 
 opportunity to update the contact details of the local representative for romania in the package 
 leaflet.</p><p>2</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2. 
 clinical aspects 
  clinical efficacy</header><p>as part of the initial marketing authorisation application (maa), the mah provided efficacy data on 467 patients from four studies covering 6 months of treatment and one study covering 3 months of 
 treatment. in this updated analysis the mah presents 2 years of follow-up of the full population 
 enrolled in the five phase 2 studies (n=865) mentioned above (table 1a).</p></section><section><header>table 1a: studies supporting the efficacy of sprycel (dasatinib)</header></section><section><header>treated study

 3</p></section><section><header>methodology</header><p>in the phase 2 studies, dasatinib was administered in line with the 70 mg (administered twice daily) bid regimen. in all 5 studies, investigators were allowed to escalate doses to achieve better efficacy or 
 to reduce doses to manage adverse events. efficacy responses were determined from haematologic 
 values, bone marrow cytology and cytogenetics, and in the presence or absence of extramedullary 
 disease. all data presented represent data collected from any subject who received at least a single 
 dose of dasatinib. response rates were estimated along with their 95% exact confidence intervals (cis) 
 based on the clopper-pearson method. kaplan-meier estimates of median time to and duration of 
 response were provided along with their 95% cis. duration of treatment is calculated as the time from 
 the first dose to the last dose of study drug; medians are presented for both imatinib-resistant and 
 imatinib-intolerant subjects enrolled in the studies. in addition, duration of response is presented for 
 both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects enrolled in the studies.</p><p>
 progression-free survival (pfs) was defined as the first date of dosing until the time disease 
 progression was first documented by the investigator or death. subjects who neither progressed nor 
 died were censored on the date of their last cytogenetic or haematologic assessment. overall survival 
 (os) time was defined as the first date of dosing until the time of death. subjects who had not died or 
 who were lost to follow-up were censored on the last date on which the subject was known to be alive.</p><p>
 major molecular responses (mmr) were assessed in studies ca180017 and ca180013 by rq-pcr 
 determined as the ratio of bcr-abl copies to a control gene. these ratios were expressed using a 
 standardized methodology initially described in the international randomized study of interferon and 
 sti-571 (iris) trial and currently reported by an international panel of experts. in brief, the 
 standardized baseline or 100% correspond to the baseline established in the iris trial. the 3-log 
 reduction or 0.1% on the international scale corresponds to a mmr.</p><p>
 molecular data were measured at 3 laboratories in the eu, usa and australia. each of these 
 laboratories obtained a conversion factor as described in the application for standardization purpose. 
 all results were subsequently converted and expressed according to the “international scale”.</p><p>
 molecular data for studies ca180005, ca180006, and ca180015 were not yet available for analysis 
 at the time of this submission. the mah has made a commitment in this regard to provide the 
 molecular data for studies ca180005, ca180006, and ca180015 within agreed timeframes.</p><p>4</p></section><section><header>results

 patients who maintained mcyr for 18 months was 90% for dasatinib and 74% for imatinib. the 
 mmr rate at any time prior to crossover was higher for the dasatinib group (29%) compared with the 
 imatinib group (12%). subjects remained on dasatinib longer than those who were treated with 
 imatinib.</p><p>
 the design of this study permitted cross-over to the alternate study drug in the case of disease 
 progression, lack of response, or adverse events that prevented continuation of the randomized study 
 drug. as of the data cut-off, 59 crossed over (39 of 40 from imatinib to dasatinib, and 20 of 50 from 
 dasatinib to imatinib). reasons for crossover from imatinib to dasatinib were: intolerance to imatinib 
 (9 subjects), disease progression (8 subjects), lack of response (20 subjects), lack of response/disease 
 progression (1 subject), and intolerance/lack of response/disease progression (1 subject). reasons for 
 crossover from dasatinib to imatinib included: intolerance to dasatinib (11 subjects), disease 
 progression (4 subjects), lack of response (4 subjects), and intolerance/disease progression (1 subject).</p></section><section><header>open-label phase 2 studies

 mcyr by 1 year. projected rates of mcyr at 12 and 24 months were 95% and 88%, respectively. a 
 higher proportion of imatinib-intolerant subjects (74%) compared with imatinib-resistant subjects 
 (35%) achieved a mmr. in subjects with imatinib resistant mutations, 63% achieved a mcyr to 
 dasatinib and 93% achieved a haematologic response to dasatinib. responses to dasatinib were 
 durable; only 21 of the 240 subjects with mcyr progressed or died.</p><p>
 in the current analysis in chronic phase cml with durations of dasatinib exposure up to 30 months, 
 response rates continued to improve compared with the initial analysis (e.g., from 45% to 62% for 
 mcyr and from 33% to 54% for ccyr in study ca180013). although most cytogenetic responses 
 were reported within the first 6 months, responses were achieved subsequently and up to the 2 years of 
 follow-up in this analysis. cytogenetic responses were reported in all subsets of imatinib-resistant and 
 imatinib-intolerant subjects including those who never responded to imatinib. durable major 
 molecular response was reported with imatinib-intolerant subjects achieving higher rates than in 
 imatinib-resistant subjects. cytogenetic responses were also reported in subjects with most types of 
 bcr/abl mutations. and finally, these responses were durable with less than 10% of subjects with a 
 mcyr losing their response thereby translating into survival benefit (figure 4.4a). altogether, third-
 line dasatinib generated results superior to second-line imatinib.</p><p>

 subjects with blast phase cml or ph+ all with 2 years of follow-up continued to demonstrate 
 benefit from dasatinib. haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were achieved by one-third or 
 more of the subjects and most subjects who achieved a response did so rapidly. durations of response 
 were shorter providing a limited long-term impact on survival. twelve subjects with myeloid blast 
 phase cml were receiving dasatinib at the time of this 2 year analysis, suggesting that dasatinib 
 9 monotherapy can lead to long-term survival. in addition, subjects who responded to dasatinib became candidates for bone marrow transplant.</p></section><section><header>mah’s summary of efficacy</header><p>with 2 years of follow-up, subjects treated with dasatinib achieved haematologic and cytogenetic responses in the open-label phase 2 studies. dasatinib was active in subjects across all phases of cml

 in all phases who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib. the group of patients were heavily pre-
 treated with other chemotherapeutic agents and also received stem cell reconstitution beside the 
 imatinib treatment.</p><p>
 overall, it can be agreed that considering the fact that haematological and cytogenetic responses are 
 commonly accepted as a surrogate endpoint in the treatment of cml, these updated analyses with 
 longer follow-up provide further evidence that early haematological and cytogenetic responses 
 correlate with a long-term favourable outcome. dasatinib has shown substantial activity in all subsets 
 of patients with cml.</p><p>
 dasatinib induces durable mcyr in patients with chronic phase cml who are imatinib-resistant and 
 imatinib-intolerant. so far less than 10% have lost their mcyr. as expected the mcyr rate is higher 
 in imatinib-intolerant patients than in patients with true imatinib resistance.</p><p>
 the results in accelerated phase cml patients with imatinib-resistance are impressive.</p><p>
 study ca180006 showed that even in late stage cml dasatinib induces haematological and 
 cytogenetic responses in patients with prolonged prior exposure to imatinib. high doses of imatinib 
 were used in about 50% of the patients before the switch to dasatinib. as expected the duration of 
 response is quite short.</p><p>
 the mah has made a commitment to provide the molecular data for studies ca180005, ca180006, 
 and ca180015 when available for review by the chmp.</p><p>12</p></section><section><header>clinical safety  
 background</header><p>in the initial maa, safety data (with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up) were collected from 511 subjects with leukaemia from one phase 1 (ca180002) and five phase 2 studies (ca180005, 
 ca180006, ca180013, ca180015, and ca180017). in the phase 1 and phase 2 clinical programme, 
 myelosuppression and fluid retention were the most important toxicities identified in subjects treated 
 with dasatinb 70 mg bid. in subjects with chronic phase cml (ca180013 and ca180002), 49% of 
 subjects reported grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and 17% reported pleural effusion 
 (grade 3/4 in 3%). in subjects with advanced phase disease (ca180005, ca180006, and ca180015), 
 approximately 80% of subjects reported grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and 28% 
 reported pleural effusion (grade 3/4 in 7%). dose interruptions and reductions were common in all 
 studies.</p><p>
 whereas this submission is based largely on the results from 2 years of follow-up in the phase 2 
 studies with 865 subjects, pooled safety data are also presented in this document from the overall 
 population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects. data were pooled by disease phase. limited pooling of 
 data was determined to be the best way to assess drug-producing adverse events (aes) because of 
 difficulties in distinguishing disease-related toxicities from drug-related toxicities in advanced phases 
 of cml.</p><p>
 safety data are presented for the safety cohort (all treated subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
 study drug). the safety prognosis for subjects resistant and intolerant to imatinib was expected to be 
 similar; therefore, all of the safety analyses combined these 2 groups except for subgroup analyses by 
 imatinib status. for study ca180017, safety data prior to crossover were included in the safety cohort.</p><p>
 in all studies, investigators were allowed to escalate subjects’ doses to achieve better efficacy or to 
 reduce subjects’ doses to manage adverse events. since none of the studies conducted used a fixed-
 dose design (i.e., dose adjustments up and down were permitted) data are not analyzed by dose. data 
 collected from any subject who received at least a single dose of dasatinib are presented. safety and 
 tolerability were assessed through collection of spontaneously reported aes, measurement of vital 
 signs, and routine laboratory testing. severity of on-study aes was graded by the investigators 
 according to the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (nci 
 ctcae) version 3 grading system. the investigator’s adverse event terms were coded and grouped by 
 preferred term and system organ class using the meddra dictionary (version 10.0) and were 
 summarized by any grade, grade 3 to 4, and grade 5 (i.e., death).</p><p>
 among the 865 subjects with cml or ph+ all from the phase 2 studies, the median duration of 
 exposure was 15.67 months (range 0.03 - 30.62 months). the majority of subjects (71%) were 
 administered dasatinib for more than 6 months (table 5.3a); 313 (36%) subjects were treated in 
 excess of 24 months.</p></section><section><header>table 5.3a: total duration of dasatinib treatment; phase 2 studies

 3 months of follow-up and in the updated safety analysis with 8 months of follow-up in 911 subjects 
 with cml or ph+ all. adverse events of myelosuppression and fluid retention identified as aes of 
 special interest are further described below.</p></section><section><header>common drug-related adverse events</header><p>of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, the most frequently reported drug-related aes (
 ≥ 20%) included diarrhoea, pleural effusion, headache, rash, nausea, superficial oedema, fatigue, and dyspnoea. while the safety profile of dasatinib in the geriatric population (
 ≥ 65 years of age; 25%) was similar to that in the younger population (&lt; 65 years of age; 75%), patients aged 65 years and 
 older reported a higher incidence of some drug-related aes associated with dasatinib use. pleural 
 effusion (38% vs. 20%), congestive heart failure (6% vs. 2%), gastrointestinal bleeding (12% vs. 7%), 
 fatigue (26% vs. 20%), and dyspnoea (34% vs. 17%) were all greater in subjects &gt; 65 years of age 
 compared with subjects &lt; 65 years old, respectively. however, the elderly generally report more co-
 morbidities than the younger group, which should be taken into consideration before drawing 
 conclusions.</p></section><section><header>comparison of adverse events by length of follow-up</header><p>overall, the drug-related aes initially reported with 8 months of follow-up were consistent with those reported after 2 years of follow-up in subjects from the 4 non-randomized phase 2 studies. most drug-
 related aes showed minimal increases with longer follow-up. fluid-retention aes and dyspnoea were 
 exceptions. with longer follow-up, higher incidence of drug-related pleural effusion, pericardial 
 effusion, and cardiac congestive failure/cardiac dysfunction was reported compared with shorter 
 (8 month) follow-up. drug-related dyspnoea increased from 18% to 29% with longer follow-up.</p></section><section><header>drug-related adverse events that led to discontinuation</header><p>drug-related aes leading to discontinuation occurring up to 30 days after the last dose were reported in 122 (14%) of the 865 subjects in the phase 2 studies. most of these discontinuations were reported 
 as aes related to disease progression. pleural effusion accounted for discontinuation in 40 subjects 
 with 12 subjects reporting severe (grade 3-4) pleural effusion. more pleural effusions were reported in 
 subjects with chronic phase cml (n = 27) and myeloid blast cml (n = 7) than in the accelerated 
 phase (n = 3), lymphoid blast phase (n = 1), and ph+ all (n = 2).</p><p>
 of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related aes leading to 
 discontinuation were mostly mild to moderate in severity and occurred at a rate of &lt; 1% in any one 
 category. exceptions included pleural effusion (3%; n = 68), congestive heart failure (1%; n = 13), 
 dyspnoea (1%; n = 23), and headache (1%; n = 12).</p><p>
 14</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events</header><p>overall, saes reported with 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the initial submission of the phase 2 programme. drug-related saes occurring up to 30 days after the last dose were reported in 
 341 (39%) dasatinib-treated subjects. pleural effusion, thrombocytopenia, and dyspnoea were the most 
 common drug-related saes. of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, the most 
 frequently reported drug-related saes (&gt; 2%) included pleural effusion (10%), gi haemorrhage (4%), 
 febrile neutropenia (4%), dyspnoea (3%), pyrexia (3%), and pneumonia (3%).the majority of gi 
 haemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia events were considered severe. fluid retention, 
 myelosuppression, bleeding-related events, and qt interval prolongation are discussed below.</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>a total of 175 (22%) subjects died. of these 175 deaths, 104 occurred within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. nearly half of the deaths were due to disease progression with the majority in subjects in 
 advanced phases of cml or ph+ all. infection was the cause of death is 36 (4%) subjects. the rate 
 of death due to infection increased with advancing disease phase with ph+ all reporting the highest 
 rate. cardiovascular disease was the reason for death in 4 subjects (acute heart failure [2 subjects], 
 arrhythmia/cardiovascular arrest [1 subject], cardiopulmonary arrest [1 subject]). fatal bleeding 
 occurred in 12 subjects (8 due to cerebral, 2 due to pulmonary, 1 due to gastrointestinal, and 1 listed as 
 haemorrhage). of these 12 subjects, gastrointestinal bleeding (ca180013-30-13257) was considered 
 possibly related and central nervous system (cns) bleeding (ca180013-47-13061) was considered 
 probably related to study treatment. death due to study drug toxicity occurred in 4 subjects. reasons 
 for study drug toxicity in these subjects were (1 subject each) bone marrow failure, intracranial 
 hypertension, global cardiac insufficiency, and moderate pleural effusion.</p><p>
 four hundred seventy-four of the 2,182 subjects (21.7%) included in this pooled population died; 239 
 deaths (11%) occurred within 30 days after administration of the last dose of dasatinib. more than half 
 (247 subjects) of the deaths were due to disease. infection was the cause of death is 94 (4%) subjects. 
 death due to fatal bleeding occurred in 33 (2%) subjects. death due to study drug toxicity occurred in 
 10 (&lt; 1%) subjects.</p></section><section><header>laboratory abnormalities</header><p>in this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe (grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. 
 there were few clinically meaningful non-haematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on 
 treatment with dasatinib with 2 years of follow-up, a result consistent with the initial phase 2 
 submission. of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, grade 3 or grade 4 non-
 haematologic laboratory abnormalities included hypophosphaemia (13%), hypocalcaemia (6%), 
 elevated sgpt (3%), elevated sgot (2%), hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), and elevated serum creatinine 
 (1%).</p></section><section><header>selected safety events</header><p>safety issues of particular interest addressed in the dasatinib product information included the aes myelosuppression, fluid retention (pleural effusion and pericardial effusion), bleeding-related events 
 and qt prolongation.</p><p>
 haematology</p><p>
 in the phase 2 studies with 2 years of follow-up, the occurrence of severe leucopoenia, 
 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia were more frequent in subjects with advanced phase 
 cml or ph+ all than in chronic phase cml. in subjects who reported severe myelosuppression, 
 recovery generally occurred following brief (2 to 4 weeks) dose interruptions or reductions. 
 in the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, myelosuppression occurred more 
 frequently in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all than in chronic phase cml (table 
 15 5.5.1). the reported grade 3 or grade 4 haematologic abnormalities included neutropenia (57.6%), thrombocytopenia (56.3%), and anaemia (35.4%). myelosuppression was generally reversible and was 
 usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or dose reduction.</p></section><section><header>table 5.5.1: ctc grades 3/4 haematological laboratory abnormalities in clinical

 in the phase 2 studies with 2 years of follow-up, drug-related fluid retention was reported in 441 
 (51%) subjects, including pleural effusion in 32% of these subjects. severe pleural effusion was 
 reported in 9% of subjects with cml or ph+ all. subjects with lymphoid blast phase cml reported 
 fewer events than in the other disease phases; however, subjects with lymphoid blast phase cml had 
 the lowest median duration of therapy compared with the other disease phases. congestive heart 
 failure, generalized oedema, and pericardial effusion accounted for a total of 16% of the events. 
 congestive heart failure was highest in subjects with chronic phase cml.</p><p>
 in the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related fluid retention was reported 
 in 855 (39%) subjects, including pleural effusion in 25% of these subjects. severe pleural effusion was 
 reported in 6% of subjects with cml or ph+ all. there was little difference in pleural effusion 
 between the disease phases. congestive heart failure, generalized oedema, and pericardial effusion 
 accounted for a total of 10% of the events.</p><p>
 bleeding-related events</p><p>
 in the phase 2 studies with 2 years of follow-up, drug-related cns haemorrhages occurred in 1% of 
 subjects receiving dasatinib. drug-related gi haemorrhage occurred in 10% of subjects. other cases of 
 haemorrhage occurred in 20% of subjects.</p><p>
 in the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related cns haemorrhages occurred 
 in 1% of subjects receiving dasatinib. drug-related gi haemorrhage occurred in 8% of subjects. other 
 cases of haemorrhage occurred in 15% of subjects.</p><p>
 cardiovascular events</p><p>
 a comprehensive evaluation of data from phase 2 studies identified treatment-emergent cardiac or 
 vascular aes. in the phase 2 studies with 2 years of follow-up, drug-related cardiac disorders were 
 reported in 141 (16%) subjects. the majority of cardiac events included arrhythmia (5%), congestive 
 heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (5%), and pericardial effusion (6%). most drug-related events were 
 mild to moderate with the exception of severe congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, which was 
 reported in 24 of the 39 subjects. 
 in the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related cardiac disorders were 
 reported in 250 (11%) subjects. the majority of cardiac events included arrhythmia (3%), congestive 
 heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (3%), and pericardial effusion (4%). most drug-related events were 
 16 mild to moderate with the exception of severe congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, which was reported in 31 of the 59 subjects.</p><p>
 qt prolongation</p><p>
 in the five phase 2 clinical trials, repeated baseline and on-treatment ecgs were obtained at pre-
 specified time points and read centrally for 865 subjects receiving dasatinib 70 mg bid. the mean 
 qtc interval changes from baseline using fridericia’s method (qtcf) were 4 to 6 msec; the upper 
 95% confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were &lt; 7 msec. a total of 5 subjects (&lt; 
 1%) reported a qtcf &gt; 500 msec. of the 2,182 subjects who received dasatinib in clinical trials, 18 
 had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse event. seventeen subjects (&lt; 1%) reported a qtcf 
 &gt; 500 msec.</p></section><section><header>pharmacovigilance</header><p>the chmp considered that the pharmacovigilance system (version 2.5) as described by the mah fulfils the legislative requirements.</p></section><section><header>risk management plan</header><p>the mah has submitted an updated risk management plan (version 3.0), which included a risk minimisation plan, based on the new safety data from the studies addressed above. all updates have

 listed as adr in section 4.8 of spc</p><p> the chmp, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the data provided represent the safety results after having treated 875 subjects with 70 mg dasatinib bid for 2 years. in the phase 2 studies, most subjects (&gt; 90%) with cml or ph+ all treated with 
 dasatinib reported at least 1 drug-related ae regardless of relationship to study drug. the pattern of 
 drug-related aes was similar across studies. in general, the most common drug-related aes (&gt; 20%) 
 were diarrhoea, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, fatigue, headache, nausea, and rash. severe (grade 3-4) 
 drug-related aes were reported in 511 (59%) subjects with cml or ph+ all. overall, diarrhoea, 
 pleural effusion, and dyspnoea were the most common severe drug-related aes.</p><p>the data following 2 years of follow-up are consistent with the safety profile reported in the initial 
 maa based on 511 subjects and in the updated safety analysis at 8 months on 911 subjects with cml 
 or ph+ all. the most frequent aes were tolerable, and saes were managed by dose interruptions or 
 dose reductions. non-haematologic aes were mild to moderate. incidence rates of fluid retention-
 related events (including pleural effusion, congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, pulmonary 
 oedema) and of myelosuppression (including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia) continue 
 to be of special interest. no new safety issues were identified.</p><p>20 pharmacovigilance</p><p>a risk management plan was submitted. the chmp, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:</p><p>
 � routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.</p><p>
 � no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.</p></section><section><header>changes to the product information</header><p>the mah has revised sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the spc in the light of the 2-year data discussed above.</p><p>
 with reference to section 4.4, the main change relates to extended information regarding fluid 
 retention in elderly and a corresponding recommendation of close monitoring. additional information 
 detailing the use of anticoagulants, asa and nsaids in some trials has also been included.</p><p>
 section 4.8 has undergone a major update as a consequence of the 2 year safety follow-up. overall, no 
 new safety signals occurred during the two years, although as a result of the exposure, some events 
 have been observed more frequently, i.e. infection, vomiting, cough and abdominal pain. table 3 in 
 section 4.8 (adr reported ≥ 5% in clinical trials) has thus been updated accordingly. further, the 
 sections addressing adrs at a frequency of &lt; 5% have been amended but no new events have been 
 added; the existing adrs have just been re-categorised.</p><p>
 a new table 4 has been introduced in section 4.8 replacing the previous text in order to provide clearer 
 information about the haematological abnormalities observed in the clinical studies.</p><p>
 in section 5.1 the description of the trials have been updated and also table 5 (former table 4) as a 
 consequence.</p><p>
 as for the package leaflet relevant changes have been inserted. the mah has submitted a 
 justification for not having performed another consultation with target groups when amending the 
 package leaflet. their main justifications are that the initial package leaflet was tested in 2006, and 
 the update aims at amending the efficacy and safety sections only. also, in their view, the changes to 
 the package leaflet are not of a major character, which can be agreed. thus, no new readability testing 
 is considered necessary.</p><p>
 further, the mah has updated annex iib to include a reference to the pharmacovigilance system 
 (version 2.5) and the risk management plan (version 3.0) agreed with the chmp. in addition, the 
 mah have implemented some minor editorial changes in the spc and annex ii and took the 
 opportunity to update the contact details of the local representative for romania in the package 
 leaflet. all these changes are acceptable.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>dasatinib is a therapeutic advance for subjects with cml or ph+ all who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. updated results from the finalised dasatinib phase 2 programme showed that subjects with 
 all phases of cml or ph+ all achieve durable haematologic and cytogenetic responses. 
 myelosuppression and fluid retention were identified as the most important toxicities in the phase 1 
 and phase 2 studies and are still considered as events of major interest.</p><p>
 the mah has forwarded an updated risk management plan which is considered acceptable. the 
 chmp, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:</p><p>
 � routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.</p><p>
 21 22 � no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.</p><p>the mah has updated annex iib to reflect the latest pharmacovigilance system (version 2.5) and risk 
 management plan (version 3.0) approved by the chmp, which is acceptable.</p><p> 
 the proposed update of the spc and package leaflet is agreed based on the submitted 2 year follow 
 up data from the five phase ii studies performed in subjects with various forms of leukaemia, 
 confirming the results seen in the initial maa which the current approval is based on.</p></section><section><header>iv. conclusion</header><p>- on 30 may 2008 the chmp considered this type ii variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
 amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics, annex ii and package 
 leaflet</p></section></body></xml>
