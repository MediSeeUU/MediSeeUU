 introduction</header><p>chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) is a haematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 to produce the philadelphia chromosome. 
 this chromosomal translocation results in a chimeric protein product bcr-abl, which is a 
 constitutively active form of the abl tyrosine kinase. cml is a progressive myeloproliferative 
 disease, which evolves through chronic, accelerated, and blast crisis phases.</p><p> 
 the philadelphia chromosome and resultant constitutively expressed bcr-abl protein tyrosine 
 kinase is present in &gt; 90-95% of patients with cml and 20% - 30 % of adult patients with acute 
 lymphoblastic leukemia.</p><p>
 the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, has become the standard of care for treatment-
 naive patients with chronic phase cml based upon the results of the pivotal phase 3 international 
 randomised interferon versus sti571 (iris) study. while not a cure, the clinical benefit provided 
 by imatinib has led to reduced need for stem cell transplantation in this patient population. in 
 newly diagnosed chronic phase cml (cp-cml) with 8 years of follow-up, imatinib was associated 
 with a complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) in 82% of patients and an estimated 8-year event-
 free survival (efs) and overall survival (os) of 81% and 85%, respectively, with data approved 
 and included in the product information of glivec. despite the results of the iris study, 
 approximately 42% of patients discontinued imatinib during this 8-year experience due to either 
 adverse events/safety, unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome, death or other reasons. with imatinib 
 treatment, transformation to accelerated or blast phase stages of the disease with a significantly 
 poorer prognosis still occurs in over 7% of patients over 5 years. 
 imatinib resistance can result from mutation of the bcr-abl gene or the over-expression of the 
 bcr-abl protein. intolerance to imatinib is associated with adverse events (aes) including fluid 
 retention, qt prolongations, changes in liver function, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and 
 diarrhoea. 
 for patients who are intolerant or resistant to imatinib, therapeutic alternatives as dasatinib and 
 nilotinib are approved as second line treatment. 
 dasatinib is a potent, broad spectrum atp-competitive inhibitor of 5 oncogenic tyrosine 
 kinases/kinase families: bcr-abl, src, c-kit, pdgfr and ephrin receptor kinases. dasatinib binds 
 to the active and inactive conformations of the abl kinase and confers inhibitory activity in abl 
 kinase domain mutations that render imatinib ineffective. dasatinib is ~325-fold more potent than 
 imatinib in inhibiting bcr-abl in vitro. 
 on 23 december 2005, orphan designation (eu/3/05/339) was granted by the european 
 commission for dasatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. 
 sprycel (dasatinib) was granted a marketing authorisation in the european union on 20 november 
 2006. it is currently indicated for the 
 treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesylate and for the 
 treatment of adults with philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
 (all) and lymphoid blast cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy
 . the currently approved posology is 100 mg administered qd (once daily) in subjects with chronic phase cml and 
 140 mg qd in subjects with advanced phase cml and ph+ all. 2 in this type ii variation (c.i.6.a), the marketing authorisation holder (mah) of sprycel applied for a new indication in the treatment of adults with</p></section><section><header>newly</header><p> diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) in chronic phase.</p><p>
 consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics 
 (smpc) and the package leaflet have been updated. annex ii has been updated to include the 
 updated version of the risk management plan (version 8.1). 
 the mah also took the opportunity to include the marketing authorisation numbers of recently 
 approved 80 mg and 140 mg strengths in annexes i and iiia.</p></section><section><header>information on paediatric requirements</header><p>pursuant to article 8 of regulation (ec) no 1901/2006, the application included an ema decision p/31/2010 for the following condition(s):</p><p>

 carcinogenicity</header><p>the mah provided a very brief summary of the status of the recently-completed (in-life portion) carcinogenicity study in rats, as it is recognised these data are considered of relevance in view of 
 the expected long treatment duration of newly diagnosed cml patients. this oral carcinogenicity 
 study in rats was initiated in august 2007 as a commitment (based on guideline ich topic s1b 
 carcinogenicity: testing for carcinogenicity of pharmaceuticals), and the in-life portion of this 
 study was completed in august 2009. doses were 3 mg/kg/day (the presumed maximum tolerated 
 dose), 1mg/kg/day, and 0.3 mg/kg/day (based on guideline ich topic s1c(r2): dose selection for 
 carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceuticals). peer review of the pathology data and microscope 
 slides has been recently completed. evaluations by the study pathologist and peer-review 
 pathologist indicated that there was no evidence of dasatinib-related tumors. the final report is 
 currently expected for submission at the latest by december 2010, as previously agreed with the 
 chmp (fum 005).</p></section><section><header>reproduction toxicity</header><p>in embryofoetal development (segment ii) studies, dasatinib induced embryolethality with associated decreases in litter size in rats, and foetal skeletal alterations in both rats and rabbits. 
 these effects in both rats and rabbits occurred at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity. 
 the current dasatinib smpc reflects the embryo-lethality observed in previous embryo-foetal 
 development and fertility and early embryonic development studies.</p><p>
 it is presently unknown whether dasatinib will be tolerated by late-gestation fetuses and neonates. 
 the mah committed to, prior to initiation of a large-scale study, perform preliminary range-finding 
 study that begins dosing of cohorts of dams at different time points in development (gestation day 
 16, lactation day 0, and lactation day 4). based on the outcome of this initial study the feasibility 
 of conducting a definitive peri- and postnatal development study will be determined.</p></section><section><header>ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>in this application, the mah included an updated environmental risk assessment (era) report, summarised in the table below.</p><p>

 discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>the mah did not conduct new non-clinical studies to support the use of dasatinib in the patient population covered by the new indication. this is acceptable as the initial marketing authorisation 
 application included most of the studies required for a long term use in patients with long life 
 expectancy.</p><p>
 preliminary evaluation of the carcinogenicity data does not seem to pose immediate concern.</p><p>
 the enlargement of the population into &quot;naive&quot; patients with a longer lasting disease might lead to 
 the identification of pregnant patients eligible for treatment during pregnancy, during the foetal 
 period, after complete organogenesis. a preliminary range-finding study that begins dosing of 
 cohorts of dams at different time points in development will be conducted as a post-authorisation 
 commitment. based on the outcome of this initial study the feasibility of conducting a definitive 
 peri- and postnatal development study will be determined.</p><p>
 in this application, the mah included an updated era report. the default pec
 sw value (0.7 ug/l) above the trigger limit (0.01 ug/l) led to a phase ii analysis. therefore, the risk of an adverse 
 environmental impact from use of dasatinib was evaluated in phase i, phase ii tier a and phase ii 
 tier b - according to era chmp guideline and supporting guidance by the european chemicals 
 bureau: technical guidance document (ecb: tgd). a revised pec
 sw value of 0.00021 μg/l was obtained by accounting for human metabolism (49.5% reduction) and refining f
 pen (0.000015 5 instead of 0.01) based on patient use. it was not corrected to account for any environmental depletion mechanisms. 
 a terrestrial testing in tier b was not conducted as the k
 oc</p><p>value (2430) is below the 10,000 threshold. however, as dasatinib is not readily biodegradable and greater than 10% of dasatinib 
 was measured in the sediment at day 14 a sediment toxicity study was conducted. dasatinib is 
 sensitive to light and this increases the removal potential of dasatinib in the aquatic environment. 
 the assessment shows that dasatinib does not affect sludge micro-organisms, aquatic organisms 
 (including sediment organisms), or bio-concentrate in aquatic species under the test conditions 
 presented in this risk assessment. of the three chronic toxicity studies conducted the fish was the 
 most sensitive species (noec was 0.018 mg/l for the survival endpoint). dasatinib fails to meet 
 the bioconcentration criteria, one of the three criteria for the pbt assessment so it is not 
 considered a pbt substance. 
 taken together the pec:pnec ratios indicate that dasatinib is unlikely to be a concern for the 
 aquatic environment and for the sediment compartment. dasatinib is unlikely to bioaccumulate to 
 any significant extent. dasatinib may have a tendency to persist in some water-sediment systems. 
 dasatinib is not considered a pbt substance. dasatinib is unlikely to adsorb to soil compartment.</p></section><section><header n="1.3">1.3.

 treated with dasatinib 100 mg qd versus the approved standard of care imatinib 400 mg qd.</p><p>
 the mah also intends to conduct a large prospective meta-analysis from a confirmatory set of 
 ongoing studies with long-term data to establish overall clinical benefit with a minimum follow-up 
 of 5 years. protocol assistance on the pivotal study (ca180056) design and long-term clinical plans 
 was given by the chmp in july 2007 (emea/chmp/sawp/310852/2007). 
 pharmacokinetics (pk) data on dasatinib from ca180056 were generated for population pk analysis 
 and exposure-response analyses and were included in this application.</p></section><section><header>gcp</header><p>the pivotal study ca180056 was performed in accordance with gcp as claimed by the mah. the mah has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
 community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of directive 2001/20/ec.</p></section><section><header n="1.3.2">1.3.2.  
 clinical pharmacology 
 pharmacokinetics</header><p>the mah submitted a population pk (ppk) analysis performed with data on 1,216 subjects from 8 clinical studies in subjects with all phases of cml or ph+all. thus 7 studies with data from 
 subjects resistant or intolerant to imatinib, and study ca180056 in 235 subjects with newly 
 diagnosed cp-cml. ppk analysis has previously been performed on data from the 7 studies that 
 enrolled resistant or intolerant to imatinib subjects.</p><p>
 6 the exposure-response (e-r) analysis for cccyr was performed with data from only ca180056, and the e-r analysis for safety (pleural effusion, pe) used combined data from ca180034 and 
 ca180056. these studies were selected based on their inclusion in the previous ppk and e-r 
 analyses, with the addition of data from ca180056 for the e-r analyses on imatinib naive cp-cml 
 subjects. 
 the model adequately characterised concentration-time data of dasatinib, and showed no 
 statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in dasatinib pk between imatinib naive and 
 imatinib previously treated patients. 
 the probability of achieving ccyr in newly diagnosed cp-cml patients decreased with increase in 
 dose interruption duration, but was not related to dasatinib exposure (weighted average 
 concentration) over the range produced by 100 mg qd. 
 the risk of pleural effusion in newly diagnosed and resistant or intolerant to imatinib cp-cml 
 patients increased with dasatinib steady-state trough concentration and age.</p></section><section><header>discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the concentration-time data of dasatinib in cml and ph+ all patients were well described by a linear 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption. 
 there were no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in dasatinib pharmacokinetics 
 between newly diagnosed cp-cml patients (1st-line) and patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib 
 (2nd-line). 
 the results of the ppk analysis support the use of dasatinib as first line treatment in patients with 
 newly diagnosed cp-cml.</p></section><section><header n="1.3.3">1.3.3.

 a phase 3 dose optimisation study in chronic phase cml (ca180034) demonstrated comparable

 140 mg qd, and 70 mg bid. with median treatment duration of 8 months, the response rates, 
 duration of major cytogenetic response (mcyr) and pfs were similar among the 4 treatment 
 groups. there was significantly less severe thrombocytopenia (22% on 100 mg qd and 37% on 70 
 mg bid) and pleural effusions (7% on 100 mg qd and 16% on 70 mg bid) in the 100 mg qd

 stratified by hasford score using cmh method. 
 the secondary endpoints will be reassessed again after 5 years using a hierarchical testing 
 procedure. the power of these tests depends primarily on the number of observed events. 
 therefore, a reassessment seems reasonable, in particular if a considerable number of additional 
 events is expected during the remaining follow-up.</p><p>
 the hierarchical test procedure maintains the overall significance level of the 5-years assessment. 
 the 12-months assessment of the secondary endpoints may be considered as an interim analysis 
 relative to the final assessment after 5 years, and the chosen significance level of 0.0001 ensures 
 that this interim analysis has very little impact on the overall level significance in the final analysis.</p></section><section><header>results participant flow</header><p>the subject disposition is summarised in the table below.</p></section><section><header>table 5 – subject disposition - enrolled subjects in study ca180056</header><p>number (%) of subjects enrolled subjects: 547</p><p>dasatinib

 no significant difference was seen in os between the two treatment groups with os at 12 months 
 at 96.4% and 96.7% in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. the follow-up period in the 
 pivotal study is too short to detect a difference in os between the treatment groups. maturation of

 dasatinib.</p><p>
 one of the tertiary objectives was to explore the</p></section><section><header>development of bcr-abl point mutations</header><p> in both treatment groups. the mah stated that the mutations were assessed in subjects at the time 
 of disease progression or at end of treatment (eot). some of these mutations have been reported 
 to confer resistance to imatinib. bone marrow samples were sequenced and reported by 
 molecularmd (portland, or). the spectrum of point mutations in the bcr-abl gene at the time of 
 progressive disease or eot was described. subjects were grouped by mutation status (i.e., no 
 mutation, location, ic50 to imatinib) by mutation status and off-treatment reason, and by specific 
 mutation. 
 in treated subjects who discontinued study therapy and had mutation data, 4/24 (17%) subjects in 
 the dasatinib group and 5/35 (14%) in the imatinib group had mutations identified at the end of 
 treatment. all mutations were outside the p-loop or activation loop. among the 4 dasatinib-treated 
 subjects, the t315i mutation (3) or f317l mutation (1) were identified. mutations identified in 
 5 imatinib treated subjects were m244v (1), e355g (2), f359v (1), and 1 subject had 2 mutations 
 (d276g and f359c). bcr/abl mutations will also be assessed with yearly updates of the study 
 results and with longer follow-up. 
 16</p></section><section><header>ancillary analyses</header><p>in most subpopulations, rates of cccyr within 12 months (primary efficacy endpoint) were higher in dasatinib-treated subjects compared with imatinib-treated subjects. in some subpopulations with 
 a limited number of subjects enrolled (&lt; 21 and

 analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-
 analysis)</header><p>in the final advice letter from the protocol assistance (july 2007), the chmp agreed with the sponsor’s proposal that the long-term clinical benefit of dasatinib can be derived from a 
 prospectively designed meta-analysis of several individual well-controlled randomised clinical trials 
 meeting pre-specified design specifications. the chmp acknowledged that pooling data from a 
 number of clinical trials represents the only realistic possibility of accurately determining the 
 long-term clinical benefit of dasatinib. as the meta-analysis protocol was not available at the time 
 of the protocol assistance procedure, this application included the statistical analysis plan (sap) for 
 such meta-analysis. this sap aims to pool data from the 3 individual studies and run a uniform 
 model to assess treatment effect. the sap is also designed to evaluate the consistency of such 
 approach by investigating the heterogeneity in treatment effect and conducting sensitivity analyses 
 on different subpopulations and endpoints. 
 no analyses performed across trials are found concerning efficacy yet.</p></section><section><header n="1.3.3.5">1.3.3.5.  
 clinical studies in special populations</header><p>no clinical studies in special populations have been submitted in this application. experience from the currently approved indication is reflected in the smpc from earlier trials. 
 no subjects &lt; 18 years old were included in the pivotal study. efficacy and safety in children and 
 adolescents under the age of 18 years has not been previously established either. very few 
 subjects more than 75 years old and even ≥ 66 years old have been studied in the proposed 
 indication.</p><p>the mah provided adequate justification for this. the treatment of older patients should 
 be similar to the overall patient population in the study. while the safety profile (overall rates of 
 aes) of dasatinib in the geriatric population was similar to that in the younger population, patients 
 aged ≥ 65 years are more likely to experience fluid retention events and dyspnoea.</p><p>this is 
 consistent with the observations in the second-line treatment of cml with dasatinib (imatinib 
 resistant/intolerant subjects) and is included in the smpc, section 4.4 as well as in section 4.8 and 
 it is considered that the treating physician should be aware of these potential differences in safety 
 to effectively manage the treatment of the older patient. 
 concerning renal impairment no clinical studies have been conducted. in the pivotal study, patients 
 with serum creatinine concentration &gt; 3 times upper limit of the normal range were excluded. 
 since the renal clearance of dasatinib and its metabolites is &lt; 4%, a decrease in total body 
 clearance is not expected in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p>
 concerning hepatic impairment it is known from earlier findings from a single-dose 
 pharmacokinetic study, patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment may receive the 
 recommended starting dose. however, due to the limitations of the study, caution is recommended 
 when administering dasatinib to patients with hepatic impairment. 
 17</p></section><section><header n="1.3.3.6">1.3.3.6.  
 discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>this application was supported by a single, multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 study based on surrogate endpoints with a minimum of 12 months of follow up data. in addition a 
 confirmatory set of studies with long-term data to establish overall clinical benefit, with a minimum 
 of 5 years of follow up, is ongoing. 
 although a confirmation trial would be desirable, the fact that this is a one-pivotal study application 
 is in line with the available guidance (points to consider on application with 1) meta-analyses; 2) 
 one pivotal study, cpmp/ewp/2330/99) as there is a pharmacological rationale and a plausible 
 hypothesis, previous data on efficacy (in second line in the same disease) is not unconvincing, the 
 results do not show any indication of a potential bias, the treatment benefit is large enough to be 
 clinically valuable, statistical evidence is strong, the trial seems to have internal validity and all 
 important endpoints show similar findings. 
 the chmp stated in the protocol assistance (emea/chmp/sawp/310852/2007) that in the 
 proposed setting the long-term clinical benefit can be derived from a prospectively designed meta-
 analysis with individual studies meeting the design specifications of the meta-analysis. this is 
 acceptable because of the small population of patients with cml and resulting difficulty in recruiting 
 a large number of patients. 
 the open-label design is not considered to be of any concern as the majority of the endpoints are 
 objectively determined i.e. cytogenetic, molecular and haematological endpoints.</p><p>
 the inclusion/exclusion criteria are adequate as they reflect the proposed indication and the 
 anticipated risks involved in the treatment with dasatinib. 
 in the pivotal study subjects were randomized 1:1 stratified by hasford score to receive either 
 dasatinib 100 mg qd or imatinib 400 mg qd. the selection of the 100 mg qd dose of dasatinib in 
 the study was based on previous dose-response studies and the phase 3 dose optimisation study in 
 chronic phase cml (ca180034) and seems reasonable. the choice and posology of the imatinib 
 control arm is acceptable as it is the current standard of care in the treatment of adult patients 
 with newly diagnosed cml in chronic phase. 
 the primary endpoint in the pivotal trial (cccyr at 12 months) was endorsed by the chmp in the 
 protocol assistance procedure. cytogenetic response evaluated in an interim analysis at 12 month 
 was used as surrogate primary endpoint when glivec (imatinib) was approved in first line 
 treatment of cml (iris). in later analysis of the iris trial it was documented that ccyr at one 
 year is predictive for pfs.</p><p>
 using pfs or os as primary endpoints is not considered feasible as it will take years before the 
 results are mature. mmr could have been acceptable as a primary endpoint as it is a more 
 sensitive way of measuring residual disease, and the previous protocol assistance recommended 
 mmr as a secondary endpoint. but since the advice was given, progress has been made to 
 standardise molecular monitoring, and consequently, the present approach is accepted, i.e. ccyr is 
 considered a validated endpoint. 
 the secondary and tertiary endpoints are found relevant to support the primary endpoint.</p><p>
 in general, the statistical analyses were adequate and address the relevant question using valid 
 tools. comparisons of the secondary endpoints were performed at a significance level of 0.0001; 
 this level allowed the testing for these endpoints without impacting the overall type i error. using 
 an extremely low significance level for the secondary endpoints ensures that these tests have 
 essentially no impact on the overall significance level. overall, the test strategy is satisfactory. 
 18 the baseline data were well balanced between the two treatment groups.</p><p>as for the results, dasatinib showed superiority to imatinib in first line treatment in subjects with 
 cml in chronic phase. the primary endpoint, cccyr rate within 12 months, is clearly met as 
 dasatinib treatment produced a significantly (p &lt; 0.007) higher cccyr rate within 12 months 
 compared with imatinib. the consistency of the results for the primary endpoint across subgroups 
 supports the robustness of the data. the primary endpoint is supported by the secondary 
 endpoints mmr at any time, time to cccyr at any time and time to mmr. the mah committed to 
 provide yearly updates of the results from the trial.</p></section><section><header n="1.3.3.7">1.3.3.7.

 there were no subjects under the age of 18 years participating in the study. the number of 
 subjects ≥ 65 years old were rather small, n = 25 in the dasatinib group and n = 29 in the imatinib

 657) in the imatinib group. 
 subjects with dose interruptions were higher in the dasatinib group (52.3 %) compared with the 
 imatinib group (35.3 %). the reasons for the first dose interruption were hematologic toxicity 
 (12.4%) and non-hematologic toxicity (8.5%) in the dasatinib group whereas the main reason in 
 the imatinib group was hematologic toxicity. subjects with dose reductions were also higher in the 
 dasatinib group (23.3 %) compared with the imatinib group (14.0%) with mainly 1-2 reductions in 
 both groups and mainly due to hematologic and non-haematologic toxicities. more subjects were 
 having a dose escalation in the imatinib group compared to the dasatinib group (14.0 % vs. 5.4%) 
 and were mainly due to “no ccyr” and ”no chr “ in the imatinib and dasatinib group respectively .</p></section><section><header>adverse events</header><p>overall the aes seen (&gt;/= 10%, any grade, drug related) were either seen with a lower or equal frequency in the dasatinib group compared to the imatinib group except for pleural effusions seen

 still evident.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</header><p>more</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p> were seen in the dasatinib group, n = 10 (3.9%), compared to the imatinib group, n = 6 (2.3%). 
 the cause of the deaths in the dasatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), infection (n = 4) 
 and myocardial infarction (mi, n = 2). six of the subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of 
 dasatinib (disease progression n = 1, infection n = 3, mi n = 2) and 4 died more than 30 days 
 after last dose of dasatinib (disease progression n = 3 and infection n = 1). 
 the cause of the deaths in the imatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), mi (n = 1) and 
 unknown (n = 1). four of the subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of imatinib (disease 
 progression n = 2, mi n = 1 and unknown n = 1) and 2 died more than 30 days after last dose of 
 imatinib because of disease progression. 
 death because of infection was only seen in the dasatinib group.</p><p>none of these four subjects 
 appeared to have significant leukopenia or neutropenia at the time of infection and were all 
 receiving multiple antibiotics. besides from that the causes of death were similar in the two 
 treatment groups.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse events</header><p>(saes) (drug-related) were reported by 8% and 5% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. 
 20 saes (drug-related) experienced by 2 or more subjects included pleural effusion (4 subjects, 2%), thrombocytopenia (3 subjects, 1%), and pyrexia (2 subjects, 0.8%) in the dasatinib group. saes 
 (drug-related) reported by 2 subjects each in the imatinib group included febrile neutropenia 
 (0.8%) and vomiting (0.8%). all other drug-related saes were reported by 1 subject each.</p><p>
 grade 3 and 4 saes (drug-related) were reported by 4% of subjects in each treatment group. 
 grade 3 and 4 saes (drug-related) reported by 2 or more subjects were thrombocytopenia (3 
 subjects, 1%) in the dasatinib group and febrile neutropenia (2 subjects, 0.8%) in the imatinib 
 group. all other severe drug-related saes were reported by 1 subject each. of the 4 saes of 
 drug-related pleural effusion in dasatinib-treated subjects, none were severe.</p></section><section><header>safety issues of special interest in the dasatinib arm</header><p>fluid retention is a well known safety issue in patients treated with tkis. associations with pleural effusions with dasatinib treatment and oedema with imatinib treatment are observed in the 
 currently approved indications. 
 in the pivotal study fluid retention (all grades) was seen more frequently with imatinib than 
 dasatinib (42% vs. 19%). the most frequent fluid retention in the dasatinib group was pleural 
 effusion (10.1%) and superficial oedema (8.9%). in the imatinib group it was superficial oedema 
 (35.7%) and generalised oedema (6.2%). other drug-related fluid retention aes were reported for 
 &lt; 2% of the subjects in either group. the risk of fluid retention is reflected in the smpc. 
 most often the dasatinib treated subjects with pleural effusions were managed by interruption of 
 dasatinib. pleural effusion did not in general impair the ability of subjects to obtain a ccyr (88.5%) 
 or achieve mmr (65.4%).</p><p>
 pulmonary oedema was reported for 1 subject (0.4%) in the dasatinib group (grade 1 and considered drug related). it is reflected in the smpc. pulmonary hypertension occurred in 
 association with dasatinib and appeared as a consequence of other fluid retention events. it was 
 reported as drug-related events in 3 (1.2%) in the dasatinib group. it is reflected in the smpc as 
 well. 
 bleeding events (regardless of relationship to study treatment) was reported in 30 (11.6%) and 27 (10.5%) subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. severe (grade 3 to 4) 
 bleeding was reported in 3 (1.2%) and 4 (1.6%) subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, 
 respectively. drug-related bleeding (consisting of gi bleeding, cns bleeding, and other 
 hemorrhage) was infrequent and comparable between groups. in the dasatinib group 13 subjects 
 (5.1%) had bleeding of any grade (2 gi bleedings and 11 other hemorrhage). in the imatinib 
 group 12 subjects, (4.7%) experienced bleeding of any grade (1 gi bleedings and 11 other 
 hemorrhage).</p><p>this despite a higher incidence of severe thromobocytopenia in the dasatinib group 
 (dasatinib: 19.1%, imatinib: 10.5%). more information must be provided concerning the 
 chronological relation of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic episodes, and the relation 
 thrombocytopenia grade and bleeding.</p><p>
 severe drug-related bleeding was reported in 1 (0.4%) dasatinib-treated subject and 2 (0.8%) 
 imatinib-treated subjects. 
 as for the 
 cardiac events, the protocol excluded subjects with significant recent cardiac events within 3 to 6 months prior to enrolment. however, nearly one quarter of the subjects had some 
 degree of cardiac co-morbidity i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and peripheral artery 
 disease.</p><p>
 21 aes in the meddra soc of cardiac disorders were more than twice as likely in subjects with cardiac co-morbidity at baseline compared with subjects without cardiac co-morbidity at baseline in both 
 groups. warnings are reflected in the smpc.</p><p>
 the rates of cardiac events, regardless of relationship, were higher with dasatinib treatment 
 compared to imatinib treatment (26 subjects, 10.1% vs. 18 subjects, 7.0%, respectively), the 
 rates of drug-related cardiac events were infrequent in both treatment groups (dasatinib 13 
 subjects, 5.0%; imatinib 12 subjects, 4.7%). 
 in the dasatinib group the most frequent cardiac events were congestive heart failure/cardiac 
 dysfunction (1.6%), palpitations (1.2%), arrhythmias (1.2%) and pericardial effusions (1.2%).</p><p>
 in the imatinib group the most frequent cardiac events were palpitations (1.6%), congestive heart 
 failure/cardiac dysfunction (1.2%) and arrhythmias (0.8%).</p><p>
 one subject in each treatment group had qt prolongation and one person in the imatinib group 
 only had ventricular arrhythmia. of the 23 subjects with drug-related cardiac aes all had resolution 
 of their aes, except for 3 subjects in the imatinib group (two with decreased ejection fraction and 
 one with ventricular arrhythmia). drug-related cardiac events led to discontinuation in 2 subjects, 
 both treated with dasatinib (grade 3 pericardial effusions, grade 4 qt prolongation). 
 qtc(f) &gt; 500 msec was seen in one subject in each treatment group. the median qtc (f) change 
 from baseline was lower with dasatinib compared with imatinib (3.0 msec vs. 8.2 msec). 
 none of the subjects had a severe cardiac dysfunction with a lvef &lt; 20% during the study. eleven 
 subjects had mild or moderate cardiac dysfunction (10 of these from baseline). seven of the 
 11 subjects had baseline cardiac risk factors including prior mi, congestive heart failure (chf), 
 hyperlipidaemia, diabetes or hypertension (4 dasatinib, 3 imatinib). eight of the 11 subjects remain 
 on study treatment (5 subjects in the dasatinib group and 3 subjects in the imatinib group). 
 the rate of abnormally elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was found in 15 subjects 
 (5.8%) in the dasatinib group vs. 7 subjects (2.7%) in the imatinib group. seven of the 15 
 subjects in the dasatinib group had a change of &lt;= 20 mmhg from baseline, 4 subjects had a 
 change of &gt;20 mmhg and 4 subjects were not reported at baseline.</p><p>there was only one subject in 
 the imatinib group who had a change of &gt;20 mmhg from baseline.</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>concerning haematology, dasatinib differ from imatinib by higher rate of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (19.1% vs. 10.5%). furthermore a higher proportion of subjects in the 
 dasatinib group reported recurrent events of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (6.2% vs. 1.6%) 
 compared with the imatinib group but without bleeding related to recurrent thrombocytopenia in 
 the dasatinib group. the median duration of the first occurrence of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia 
 were 2.8 weeks vs. 3.4 weeks in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively.</p><p>
 grade 3 to 4 baseline hematologic abnormalities were found in 2.3% or less of randomised 
 subjects. most subjects had some degree of cytopenia on study; however, the majority was grade 
 1 or 2. otherwise between the dasatinib and imatinib groups, the rates of grade 3 to 4 leukopenia 
 (8.6% vs. 9.7%), neutropenia (20.7% vs. 20.2%), and anemia (10.2% vs. 6.6%) were 
 comparable. 
 a total of 7 subjects (dasatinib: 4, imatinib: 3) reported grade 3 to 4 alt and/or ast or total 
 bilirubin levels during the study. elevations in liver function tests led to study drug discontinuation 
 in 2 subjects both from the imatinib group. 
 22 grade 3 to 4 creatinine levels were reported for 3 subjects (1 dasatinib-treated subject and 2 imatinib-treated subjects). 
 with the exception of phosphorus, there were few cases on-study of grade 3 to 4 levels in these 
 other chemistries (calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, sodium, uric and acid) 
 and little difference between the treatment groups. hypophosphatemia, a known side effect of 
 imatinib, was reported as grade 3 in 11 dasatinib-treated subjects (4.4%) and 54 imatinib-treated 
 subjects (21.6%) and no grade 4 events were reported.</p></section><section><header>safety in special populations</header><p>concerning gender related differences, a higher proportion of aes were seen in females compared to males (88.6% vs. 78.4%) as well as aes leading to discontinuation (6.2% vs. 2.6%). a higher 
 proportion of deaths were reported in males than in females (4.2% vs. 1.4%). 
 concerning pregnancy there are no adequate and well controlled studies. it is furthermore 
 unknown whether dasatinib is excreted in the human milk.</p></section><section><header>safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</header><p>it is well known that the following drugs may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations: cyp3a4 inducers, antacids and h2 antagonists/proton pump inhibitors. furthermore it is also well 
 known that cyp3a4 substrates may have their plasma concentrations altered by dasatinib.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation due to adverse events</header><p>drug-related aes leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported by 5% and 4% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. severe drug-related aes leading to 
 discontinuation were reported by 3 % in each treatment group. 
 concerning drug-related aes leading to discontinuation in more than one subject the mah indicated 
 that in the dasatinib group 4 subjects had cytopenias and 3 subjects had pleural effusion that led 
 to discontinuation of study drug. in the imatinib group, 3 subjects had cytopenias that led to 
 discontinuation of study drug. all other drug-related aes inclusive severe drug-related aes leading

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the assessment of the safety of dasatinib with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up in adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml is based on analysis of 516 treated subjects, 258 
 in the dasatinib arm and 258 in the imatinib arm. the number of randomized and treated subjects 
 as well as the duration of therapy (14.01 and 14.28 months in the dasatinib and imatinib arm 
 respectively) was overall well balanced.</p><p>
 the safety profiles of both dasatinib and imatinib did not indicate any new or unexpected major 
 concerns. 
 drug related non-haematological adverse events associated with both treatments were primary 
 grade 1 or 2.</p><p>
 aes are seen in 93% of the subjects in both treatment groups. drug related aes (any grade) are 
 seen in 80% and 85% in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. drug related grade 3-4 aes 
 was reported in 30% and 24 % in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. 
 most frequent drug related aes in the dasatinib group were: diarrhoea (17%), headache (12%) 
 and pleural effusion (10%). most frequent drug related aes in the imatinib group were: superficial 
 oedema (36%), nausea (20%), muscle spasms (17 %), diarrhoea (17%), rash (13%), eyelid 
 oedema (13%), myalgia (12 %) and vomiting (10%). 
 aes (drug related) seen with higher frequency in the dasatinib group compared to imatinib: pleural

 aes (drug related) seen with higher frequency in the imatinib group compared to dasatinib: 
 superficial oedema (36%), nausea (20%), muscle spasms (17 %), rash (13%), eyelid oedema 
 (13%), myalgia (12 %) and vomiting (10%). 
 more deaths were seen in the dasatinib group (n = 10, (3.9%)) compared to the imatinib group 
 (n = 6, (2.3%)). the cause of the deaths in the dasatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), 
 infection (n = 4) and mi (n = 2). six of the subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of 
 dasatinib. the cause of the deaths in the imatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), mi (n = 
 1) and unknown (n = 1).</p><p>
 saes (drug-related) were reported by 8% and 5% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, 
 respectively. saes (drug-related) experienced by 2 or more subjects included pleural effusion 
 (4 subjects, 2%), thrombocytopenia (3 subjects, 1%), and pyrexia (2 subjects, 0.8%) in the 
 dasatinib group. saes (drug-related) reported by 2 subjects each in the imatinib group included 
 febrile neutropenia (0.8%) and vomiting (0.8%). all other drug-related saes were reported by 
 1 subject each. grade 3 and 4 saes (drug-related) were reported by 4% of subjects in each 
 treatment group. grade 3 and 4 saes (drug-related) reported by 2 or more subjects were 
 thrombocytopenia in the dasatinib group and febrile neutropenia in the imatinib group.</p><p>
 pleural effusions are known to be associated with dasatinib, oedema and muscle cramps with

 benefits</header><p> beneficial effects the efficacy of dasatinib in newly diagnosed patients with cml-cp has been evaluated in a phase 
 iii, open label, randomised superiority trial (study ca180056 or dasision) comparing dasatinib 
 100 mg qd with imatinib 400 mg qd. a total of 519 patients were randomised, 259 patients in the 
 dasatinib group and 260 patients in the imatinib group.</p><p>
 the open-label design is considered acceptable as the majority of the endpoints are objectively 
 determined i.e. cytogenetic, molecular and haematological endpoints.</p><p>
 27 the primary endpoint was cccyr rate at 12 months. this endpoint is widely accepted as a surrogate of clinical benefit and the adequacy of the primary surrogate endpoint stems from an 
 analysis of the iris trial showing that ccyr at 1 year is predictive for pfs. this surrogate endpoint 
 should be supported by time-dependent endpoints such as pfs and os.</p><p>in that context it should 
 be taken into account that the overall 7-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed cml-
 cp treated with imatinib is now estimated to be 86 %. 
 treatment with dasatinib produced a significantly (p &lt; 0.007) higher cccyr rate within 12 months 
 (77%) compared with imatinib (66%) meeting the primary endpoint. the primary endpoint is 
 supported by the secondary endpoints mmr at any time, time to ccyr at any time and time to 
 mmr.</p><p>
 the pfs rates at 12 months are 96.4% (dasatinib) and 96.7% (imatinib), and the os rates at 
 12 nonths are 97.2% (dasatinib) and 98.8 (imatinib). the pfs and os data are still immature but 
 will be provided post authorisation. also, the rates of progression to cml-ap or cml-bc cannot be 
 reliably assessed at this point in time.</p><p>
 overall, study ca180056 convincingly demonstrates a favourable effect of dasatinib in comparison 
 with imatinib in the first line treatment of patients with cml in chronic phase.</p><p>
  uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects efficacy in terms of cccyr beyond 12 months is not known. time-dependent endpoints are needed 
 for a more definitive assessment of long term efficacy. at present os and pfs are still immature 
 but no detrimental effect is seen in the dasatinib group or the imatinib group.</p><p>the mah committed 
 to provide yearly updates of the results from the trial.</p><p>
 if dasatinib substitutes imatinib as the preferred first-line treatment for cml-cp there is no 
 evidence-based second-line therapy for patients failing dasatinib. however, this important clinical 
 issue is not expected be resolved by the applicant at this point in time. however, the mah 
 committed to make proposals to prospectively collect response data (type, magnitude and

 dasatinib.</p></section><section><header>risks</header><p> unfavourable effects the observed safety profile for imatinib and dasatinib in the pivotal study was consistent with the 
 known safety profile for both compounds. there were no new or unexpected major findings.</p><p>
 dasatinib is overall well tolerated. the safety profile of dasatinib has some differences compared to 
 the safety profile of imatinib, however, it is not worse and acceptable in the proposed indication.</p><p>
 pleural effusions are known to be associated with dasatinib, oedema and muscle cramps with 
 imatinib. these findings were confirmed in the pivotal study. pleural effusion was the most 
 common fluid retention in the dasatinib group (10% vs. 0%) but discontinuation overall due to 
 pleural effusion is infrequent. all pleural effusions were grade 1 to 2. most often the dasatinib 
 treated subjects with pleural effusions were managed by interruption of dasatinib but diuretic, dose 
 reduction, corticosteroids and one thoracocentesis were also used. three subjects discontinued due 
 to pleural effusion. pleural effusion did not in general impair the ability of subjects to obtain a ccyr 
 or achieve mmr.</p><p>
 28 with regards to haematological toxicity dasatinib differ from imatinib by higher rate of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (19.1% vs. 10.5%). most subjects had some degree of cytopenia on study; 
 however, the majority was grade 1 or 2. 
 another safety issues to be mentioned is the rate of abnormally elevated pulmonary artery systolic 
 pressure (&gt; 40 mmhg) which was found in 5.8% in the dasatinib group vs. 2.7% in the imatinib 
 group.</p><p>
  uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects when pleural effusions (or other conditions) are treated with interruption of dasatinib or dose 
 reduction it is not known if the duration of efficacy is sustained or the subjects will progress earlier. 
 this, although the subjects in general did not have their ability to obtain a ccyr impaired in the 
 pivotal study. 
 also, the etiological relevance of dasatinib treatment to cardiac dysfunction, including cardiac 
 failure, conduction disturbances, ischemia and myocardial infarction doesn’t seem well defined or 
 quantified. 
 the relation of haemorrhage to thrombocytopenia or to other haemostatic defect secondary to 
 dasatinib is not fully clarified.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance</header><p> importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</p><p>the higher cccyr within 12 months achieved with dasatinib as compared to imatinib are very 
 promising results indicating substantial higher efficacy for the second generation tki dasatinib as 
 compared with the hitherto standard of care of patients with newly diagnosed cmp-cp.</p><p>
 the observed safety profile for dasatinib in the pivotal study was consistent with the known safety 
 profile. there are so far no indications that dasatinib has any detrimental effects on os as 
 compared to imatinib.</p><p>
  benefit-risk balance in conclusion treatment of first line cml-cp subjects show clear superiority of efficacy in the 
 dasatinib group compared to the imatinib group. long term efficacy results are warranted, and 
 should be submitted postapproval. the safety profile of dasatinib is in some aspects different from 
 that of imatinib but not worse, and overall manageable.</p></section><section><header n="1.5.1">1.5.1.

 recommendation</header><p>based on the chmp review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the chmp considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of sprycel in the treatment of adult patients with newly 
 diagnosed philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) in the chronic 
 phase was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of this extension of indication. 
 in addition, the chmp, with reference to article 8 of regulation (ec) no 141/2000, considers 
 sprycel not to be similar (as defined in article 3 of commission regulation (ec) no 847/2000) to 
 glivec and tasigna for the same therapeutic indication. 
 furthermore, the chmp takes note that the agreed paediatric investigation plan is not fully 
 completed yet as only some of the measures are completed.</p></section><section><header>user consultation</header><p>the mah provided a justification for not performing a consultation with target patients groups, for the submitted application. in line with ema guideline, and within the scope of the current proposed
