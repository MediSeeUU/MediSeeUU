 treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase (cp)-cml, sprycel was approved in 
 the us (28-oct-2010) and in the eu (6-dec-2010). marketing authorization approval for the indication 
 of adult subjects with newly diagnosed cp-cml is currently under review in several other countries.

 an mtd utilizing the pre-specified dose levels, efficacy, safety and pk data were reviewed to determine 
 the recommended phase 2 dasatinib dose. the recommended phase 2 dose is 60 mg/m
 2 qd for pediatric subjects with cp-cml (stratum 1) and 80 mg/m
 2 qd for pediatric subjects with ph+ all or ap/bp-cml (stratum 2/3). due to the lack of efficacy, there is no plan to move forward with the 
 development of dasatinib therapy for the ph- leukemias in phase 2 (stratum 4).</p><p>page 2/12</p></section><section><header>methods</header><p> objectives</p></section><section><header>primary objective:</header><p>to establish, by stratum using a dose-finding design, a recommended phase 2 dose of dasatinib (bms-354825) in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia.</p></section><section><header>secondary objectives:</header><p>1) to determine the adverse events (aes) and identify any dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) of dasatinib in children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) in chronic phase (cp) 
 (ph+;stratum 1) or advanced leukemias (strata 2/3 and 4 aggregated) 
 2) to estimate, by stratum, the rates of morphologic (major hematologic response [mahr]), 
 cytogenetic (major cytogenetic response [mcyr]; strata 1 and 2/3 only), and molecular 
 (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qpcr]; subjects with mcyr only, strata 1 and 2/3 only) 
 responses to dasatinib 
 3) to describe, by stratum, time to response, response duration, progression-free survival (pfs), 
 and survival of children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib 
 4) to estimate, as a function of dasatinib dose, plasma and (if applicable) cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 
 pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters of dasatinib</p><p>
 5) to describe the spectrum of mutations in the bcr-abl gene (strata 1 and 2/3) and in the flt3 
 and kit genes (stratum 4) at baseline and at end of treatment and to explore the role of 
 mutations as predictors of response. 
 in addition, protocol amendment 5 (approved 08-dec-2009) and united kingdom country-specific 
 amendment 06 (dated 05-may-2010) added laboratory and radiographic assessments to monitor 
 growth and development and bone mineral metabolism to be performed annually for up to 5 years of 
 follow-up after completion of study drug. 
  study design ca180018 is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation (3+3 design, intra-subject dose escalation) study 
 in which eligible subjects were treated with dasatinib orally qd until refractory disease progression, 
 intolerable toxicity, or patient/physician preference. dasatinib could be continued for as long as clinical 
 benefit was maintained.</p><p>
 the target population included children and adolescents, ≥ 1 to &lt; 21 years of age, with ph+ cml in 
 chronic, accelerated, or blast phase (bp) resistant or intolerant to imatinib, or in first or subsequent 
 relapse of ph+ all after prior imatinib, or in second or subsequent relapse of ph- all or aml. 
  study population /sample size in ca180018, 58 subjects were treated with dasatinib and were evaluable for the primary endpoint 
 (selection of the phase 2 dose): 
  17 in stratum 1: all ph+ cp-cml  17 in stratum 2/3 o 1 subject with ph+ lymphoid blast phase (lbp) cml o 2 subjects with ph+ ap cml o 14 subjects with ph+ all</p><p>page 3/12 
  24 in stratum 4 o 15 subjects with ph- aml o 9 subjects with ph- all</p><p>
 the mean age of the entire study population was 10 years. fifty-seven of the 58 treated subjects were 
 1 to 18 years of age. this includes 34 subjects 1 to &lt; 12 years and 23 subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years. one subject with ph- aml was 21 years and 1 month at baseline. roughly two-thirds of the subjects in each 
 stratum were male and 90% were white. a summary of dosing is provided in table 4.2.</p></section><section><header>table 4.2: median duration of therapy and median of the average daily dose strata

 intra-subject dose escalation was allowed based on 
 tolerance and on individual response. this design ensured maximal therapeutic benefit for children and</p><p>page 4/12 
 adolescents with ph+ disease, without a requirement to escalate to maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and incur toxicity.</p><p>
  outcomes/endpoints</p></section><section><header>efficacy:</header><p> efficacy variables included hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to dasatinib. time to response, response duration, progression-free survival (pfs), and overall survival with 
 relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib were also measured. mutations in the bcr-abl 
 (for subjects with ph+ leukemias in strata 1 and 2/3) and mutations in flt3 and kit genes (for 
 subjects with ph - leukemias in stratum 4) were studied.</p></section><section><header>safety:</header><p> aes, drug-related aes, aes leading to discontinuation, serious adverse events (saes), aes of special interest, laboratory measurements, electrocardiograms (ecg), echocardiograms, and deaths 
 were summarized. investigator reported ae terms were coded and grouped by system organ class 
 (soc) using the medical dictionary for regulatory affairs (meddra) dictionary version 14. aes and 
 other symptoms were graded according to the nci ctcae version 3.0. specific measures for long-term 
 follow-up of growth and development were added in protocol amendment 5 (08-dec-2009).</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics:</header><p> pk variables included: maximum observed plasma concentration (cmax), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time 
 zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (auc[0-t]), area under the plasma</p><p>
 concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinite time (auc[inf]), terminal elimination 
 half-life (t-half), dose normalized (dn) cmax, dn auc(0-t), and dn auc(inf). 
  statistical methods the sample size was not based on statistical power to detect a specific response rate but on the 
 feasibility of accrual and on the dose levels used for the escalations of the starting dose. 
 in stratum 1 and in stratum 2/3, at least 12 subjects in each stratum were to be treated to meet the 
 primary objective (6 subjects at the 60 mg/m2 starting dose; and 6 subjects at the 80 mg/m2 starting 
 dose, unless there was excessive toxicity at either dose, or no clinical need to escalate to 80 mg/m2). 
 up to additional 4 subjects were to be treated at the 60 mg/m2 dose level in stratum 1 and at the 80 
 mg/m2 level in stratum 2/3 to expand the number of subjects at the dose level selected for the phase 
 2 study. 
 in stratum 4, a maximum of 6 subjects were to be accrued per dose level; the highest starting dose 
 was to be 120 mg/m2. 
 dose escalation was based on the tolerability at a given dose level and the clinical efficacy at a given 
 dose. the recommended phase 2 dose was determined based on the aggregation of safety data for 
 these strata, and an assessment of safety at a minimum of 2 dose levels was planned. 
 best on-study hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response rates including key efficacy endpoints 
 were estimated using all treated subjects by stratum and by dose cohort. ninety-five percent exact 
 confidence intervals (cis) using the method of clopper and pearson were provided for rates computed 
 on the recommended phase 2 dose. 
 kaplan-meier plots for pfs, overall survival (os), duration and time to response by stratum were 
 planned and provided. a 2-sided, 95% ci for the median was computed using the method of 
 brookmeyer and crowley.</p><p>page 5/12</p></section><section><header>results</header><p> recruitment/ number analysed of the 58 treated subjects, 51 subjects were off treatment at the time of database lock (table 3). as of

 (table above) as clinical activity in paediatric subjects with ph+ leukemias with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior imatinib was shown. response rates in children with cp-cml at 60 mg/m2 qd and 
 in children with ap-cml and ph+ all at 80 mg/m2 qd was favourable. 
 the data also showed that no responses were observed in paediatric subjects with treatment-refractory 
 ph–all or aml (stratum 4) despite escalations to the highest dose in this trial of 120 mg/m2.</p><p> </p></section><section><header>safety results</header><p>two subjects (both in stratum 4) with other co-morbidities, had dose-limiting toxicities. one subject developed grade 4 anaphylaxis 5 hours after the first dose of study drug (60 mg/m
 2) and the event resolved the same day. this resulted in discontinuation of dasatinib therapy and discontinuation from 
 study. the other subject (120 mg/m
 2 dose cohort), who had a platelet count of 16 x 109/l developed an upper gi hemorrhage (grade 3) on day 6 that resolved on day 11 of the study. this event led to 
 interruption of dasatinib dosing. a maximum tolerated dose was not established for any strata on this 
 study.</p></section><section><header>rates of adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuation from therapy</header><p>a total of 38 subjects died: 3 (18%), 12 (71%), and 23 (96%) in strata 1, 2/3, and 4, respectively; however, none of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study therapy. most 
 were related to disease progression and infections.</p><p>page 9/12 
 drug-related saes were reported in 12%, 29% and 33% of subjects in strata 1, 2/3, and 4, respectively. with the exception of thrombocytopenia, which was reported in 2 subjects (12%) in 
 stratum 2/3, all other drug-related saes were reported by 1 subject each per stratum. 
 there were no drug-related aes leading to discontinuation of dasatinib reported in strata 1 and 2/3. 
 two (8%) subjects in stratum 4 had drug-related aes leading to discontinuation of dasatinib. one 
 subject (previously mentioned in section 5) in the 60 mg/m
 2 dose cohort (with a history of allergies) had grade 4 anaphylaxis 5 hours after the first dose of dasatinib (60 mg/m
 2). the other subject in the 100 mg/m
 2 dose cohort (with no reported medical history of allergies) had an sae of urticaria (grade 2).</p><p>
 drug-related non-hematologic aes reported by 
  10% of subjects in any treatment group include the following: headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, pain in extremity, mouth ulceration, vomiting, arthralgia, 
 back pain, fatigue, malaise, peripheral edema, pyrexia, pruritus, and urticaria in stratum 1, diarrhea, 
 nausea, vomiting, rash, headache, fatigue, and epistaxis in stratum 2/3, and nausea, vomiting, 
 headache, and arthralgia in stratum 4.</p></section><section><header>laboratory assessments, vital signs, ecgs</header><p>most subjects 
 had 
 some 
 degree 
 of 
 cytopenia 
 on 
 study; 
 however, 
 no 
 subject 
 had 
 cytopenia/myelosuppression that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. no other laboratory 
 abnormalities led to discontinuation of dasatinib therapy. 
 ecg results were similar among the strata; most subjects had a decline in qtc(f) from baseline in the 
 -60 to 0 msec range (median 7.5 msec for the overall population). no subject had a qtc (f) 
 &gt; 500 msec. abnormal echocardiogram results were reported for 1 subject with a normal result at 
 baseline; this subject had no associated cardiac aes associated with the abnormal results and 
 subsequently had normal echocardiogram results. two subjects with abnormal echocardiogram results 
 at baseline also had abnormal results on study. there were no discontinuations of dasatinib therapy 
 because of abnormal ecg or echocardiogram results.</p></section><section><header>adverse events and laboratory measurements of special interest</header><p>adverse events (aes) of special interest in the dasatinib program were examined either because of their association with dasatinib in the currently approved indications, because they are recognized 
 events in other agents within this drug class, or because safety data from nonclinical and clinical 
 studies warranted careful evaluation. aes of special interest include fluid retention, cardiac disorders, 
 diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, rash, bleeding events, hypersensitivity, and hearing loss.</p><p>
 drug-related severe (grade 3, none were grade 4) aes of special interest, were uncommon, 
 manageable, and generally did not lead to discontinuation of dasatinib. in this study, 7 subjects had 
 drug-related grade 3 aes of special interest; this includes</p><p>
  stratum 2/3:</p><p>o bleeding event (n = 1), grade 3 epistaxis on day 57 that resolved in 2 days. the subject was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 20 x 10

 importantly, no pediatric subjects experienced pulmonary arterial hypertension during this trial, including none of the 13 subjects treated for more than one year with dasatinib. 
 tests to monitor growth and development and bone metabolism were added to the study as 
 mandatory protocol procedures; however, at the time these tests were added, only 18 of the 
 58 subjects were either on treatment or in follow-up. because of the limited amount of data available 
 at the time of database lock for the ca180018 clinical study report and the limited follow-up, no 
 definitive conclusions can made on the effect of dasatinib therapy on growth in pediatric subjects, 
 however, preliminary data do not demonstrate a negative impact on growth and bone mineral 
 metabolism. in ca180018, data for long-term growth assessment continues to be collected.</p></section><section><header>assessors comment</header><p>the data presented showed a safety profile that was manageable in pediatric subjects with leukemia. no unexpected adverse events were observed.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>plasma pk data were available for 53 subjects. each subject could have 1, 2 or 3 plasma pk profiles sampled, depending on the number of times the dose of dasatinib was escalated. csf pk data were 
 available for 9 subjects.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib in plasma - effect of age and dasatinib dose</header><p>dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory leukemia. mean tmax was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours. mean t-half ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels 
 and age groups. high inter-subject variability was observed in the pk parameters of pediatric subjects. 
 the geometric means of dose-normalized (dn) dasatinib cmax, auc(0-t), and auc(inf) appeared to 
 be similar between children and adolescents. at both the 100 and 120 mg/m2 dose levels, pk 
 parameters were available from one subject in the infants and toddler age group. it is difficult to 
 compare the pk of dasatinib in the infant and toddler age group with children and adolescents due to 
 insufficient sample size in the infant and toddler age group. 
 in post hoc analyses, the geometric means of dose-normalized dasatinib cmax, auc(0-t) and 
 auc(inf) appeared not to be statistically different between children and adolescents at the different 
 dose levels.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib by formulation</header><p>there were two dosage forms administered to subjects in this study: tablets and dispersed tablets. subjects received their dasatinib dose as tablets (supplied as 5, 20, and 50 mg strengths) if they were 
 able to swallow tablets. to permit administration in young children who were unable to swallow 
 tablets, the dasatinib tablets were dispersed into 30 ml lemonade or orange juice or apple juice prior 
 to dose administration. the overall median tmax was 0.5 hour shorter for the dispersed tablet 
 compared with the tablet formulation. pk parameters were available from only one adolescent who 
 received the dispersed tablet; hence dasatinib exposure from the two dosage forms was compared in 
 children group only. in a post-hoc statistical analysis comparing the exposure of dasatinib in children 
 given tablets or dispersed tablets, no evidence of a difference between formulations could be seen in 
 the children group. however, the relatively wide confidence intervals of the slope for the power models 
 were obtained for all pk parameters.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic results in cerebral spinal fluid</header><p>the mean 4 hour post-dose csf concentration of dasatinib in children and adolescents ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 ng/ml, whereas the mean dasatinib plasma concentrations at the same time point ranged from</p><p>page 11/12</p><p>page 12/12 
 38 to 88 ng/ml in the same groups of subjects. hence, in pediatric subjects, the concentrations of dasatinib in csf at 4 hours post-dose are 1% - 5% of the concentration in plasma.</p><p>of the 32 csf 
 samples analyzed from 9 subjects, 21 samples had measurable concentrations of dasatinib, none had 
 detectable concentrations of bms-582691, and 2 samples had detectable concentrations of bms-
 606181.</p></section><section><header>assessors comment</header><p>the pharmacokinetic data submitted showed that dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in paediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory leukemia and that administration of dasatinib resulted in systemic 
 exposures in terms of cmax, auc(0-t), and auc(inf) that were consistent with dose proportionality in 
 the dose range of 60 to 120 mg/m2. also, the median tmax was slightly shorter for the dispersed 
 tablet compared with the tablet formulation. no statistical difference in cmax, auc(0-t), and auc(inf) 
 was observed between the tablet and the dispersed tablet.</p></section><section><header>rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation</header><p>data for efficacy, safety and pk testing dasatinib 60 and 80 mg/m2 qd in a paediatric population with ph+ leukemias showed a favorable benefit risk profile. but additional studies will be conducted to 
 further support a once daily dosing in pediatric ph+ cml and all. 
 it can be agreed that based on the data submitted the recommended dasatinib dose for future phase 2 
 studies in paediatric subjects with ph+ leukemias will be 60 mg/m
 2 qd for subjects with cp-cml and 80 mg/m
 2 qd for subjects with ph+ all or ap/bp-cml.</p></section><section><header>recommendation</header><p>x</p></section><section><header>fulfilled</header><p> – no further action required</p></section><section><header>additional clarifications requested</header><p> not applicable</p></section></body></xml>
