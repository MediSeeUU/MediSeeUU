 pdgfβ receptor. the marketing authorisation was granted in november 2006 for the treatment of 
 adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) with resistance or 
 intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesylate, and also for the treatment of adults with 
 philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) and lymphoid blast 
 cml with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.</p><p>
 at the time of the chmp opinion in september 2006, the marketing authorisation holder (mah) 
 made a commitment (fum 010) to provide data post-authorisation from two phase 3 studies 
 comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib administered once daily (qd) versus twice daily (bid) 
 in subjects with chronic (ca180034) and advanced phase cml or ph+ all (ca180035).</p><p>

 the mah has now applied for a type ii variation to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the 
 spc in line with the first results at 6 months of follow-up of the ongoing studies ca180034 and ca 
 180035, which are both conducted in accordance with current gcp standards.</p><p>
 further, the mah takes the opportunity to update section 4.8 of the spc in line with the outcome of 
 the chmp assessment of the 1
 st psur and according to meddra version 8.2. the package leaflet has been amended accordingly. in addition, the mah have implemented some minor editorial changes 
 in the annexes and updated the contact details of the local representatives for romania and denmark 
 in the package leaflet.</p></section><section><header>clinical aspects  clinical pharmacology</header><p>no additional studies on biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology have been submitted as part of this application.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy  -

 unlike subjects with chronic phase cml, late-stage advanced cml subjects frequently present with 
 fibrotic or hypocellular bone marrow. this results in inadequate baseline bone marrow data and 
 subjects who are unevaluable for response. similarly, bone marrow reserves in these subjects may be 
 largely exhausted, resulting in an inability to reconstitute normal hematopoietic elements. for these 
 reasons, response rates in advanced stage subjects are presented primarily as hematologic responses, 
 such as mahr and complete haematologic response (chr) rates (normalization of all peripheral 
 blood counts), in addition to complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) and partial cytogenetic response 
 (pcyr) rates, and no evidence of leukemia ([nel]; absence of ph+ metaphases on cytogenetic 
 evaluation with persistent cytopenias on peripheral blood counts.</p></section><section><header>- results

 randomized subjects at 140 mg qd relative to 70 mg bid. the qd schedule would be considered 
 similar (non-inferior) to the bid schedule if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of 
 the difference in major hematologic response rates was ≥-12%. the analysis in all randomized 
 subjects showed that the qd schedule was similar (non-inferior) to the bid schedule in major 
 hematologic response rates (table 9). the qd and bid groups showed little difference in mcyr

 over the age of 75 years achieved a mahr in the qd group compared with the bid group.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>the study design and selected endpoints are all acceptable and in accordance with the agreed fum 010. both studies are still ongoing and the final results due in 2009. the provision of these interim 
 results is part of the fum.</p><p>
 11 with reference to study ca180034, an adequate number of patients reflecting the approved indication has been included in the study. from an efficacy point these results clearly support the proposed 
 change in dosing recommendation for patients with chronic phase cml. the results must be 
 considered robust as consistency is found for both primary and secondary endpoints.</p><p>
 in study ca180035, although non-inferiority was demonstrated for the overall qd versus bid 
 treatment schedule, the secondary endpoints do not unequivocally support this finding. major 
 differences in duration of response (median time to progression) and deaths favours the current bid 
 dosing for patients with advanced cml or ph+ all. it is agreed with the mah, that this dose not 
 support a change in dosing posology.</p><p>
 again the chmp considers that these data across age, race and gender support the proposed changes 
 in posology for chronic phase cml but not for advanced cml or ph+ all.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety

 were lower in the 100 mg qd group than in the 70 mg bid group. grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was 
 reported less frequently in subjects in the 100 mg qd group than in the 70 mg bid group. the rates of 
 thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia were significantly lower in the 100 mg qd group than in the

 pleural effusions than the other 3 groups.</p></section><section><header>ca180035 -</header><p> the results from this study demonstrated that the qd schedule was better tolerated than the bid schedule. the most important difference between the groups was observed in the rate of fluid

 group (nausea and anorexia) and others favouring the bid group (headache). there were minimal 
 differences in myelosuppression, which were severe in both treatment groups. the difference in 
 toxicity resulted in less frequent dose reductions and dose interruptions in the qd group, allowing for 
 a more sustained drug administration.</p></section><section><header>- common drug-related adverse events</header><p>overall, drug-related aes reported in ca180034 and ca180035 were common to those reported in the phase 2 studies. in ca180034, drug-related aes occurred less frequently in the 100 mg qd group

 safety in the overall population</p><p>
 in the overall population of 2182 dasatinib-treated subjects, severe (grade 3/4) fluid retention was 
 reported in 7% of subjects treated with dasatinib, including pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 
 4% and 1% of subjects, respectively. severe ascites and generalized edema were each reported in 
 &lt;1%. severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1% of subjects. severe pleural effusion may require 
 thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care 
 measures that included diuretics and/or short courses of steroids.</p><p>
 myelosuppression occurred more frequently in subjects with advanced phase cml or ph+ all than 
 in chronic phase cml. the reported grade 3 or grade 4 hematologic abnormalities included 
 neutropenia (57.6%), thrombocytopenia (56.3%), and anemia (35.4%). myelosuppression was 
 generally reversible and usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or dose reduction.</p><p>
 overall, severe central nervous system (cns) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in 1% of 
 subjects receiving dasatinib. severe gastrointestinal (gi) hemorrhage occurred in 6% of subjects and 
 16 generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. other cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 3% of subjects. most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia.</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>safety data from ca180034 supports the change in posology proposed by the mah in this type ii variation. the qd dosing in patients with chronic phase cml resulted in fewer ae’s including those 
 most frequently seen with dasatinib in the overall clinical development program.</p><p>
 safety data also supported the qd dosing in patients with advanced phase cml or ph+ all, although 
 these results are not as convincing as for patients in chronic phase (study ca180034).</p><p>
 the data from these two phase iii studies add to the overall safety database for dasatinib, and the 
 relevant spc sections have been amended accordingly by the mah. further, the mah has forwarded 
 an updated risk management plan, which is considered acceptable.</p></section><section><header>spc changes as a result of the chmp assessment of the 1</header><p>st</p></section><section><header>psur</header><p>following the committee’s assessment of the 1st periodic safety update report (psur) for dasatinib oral tablets (covering the period from 28 june 2006 through 27 december 2006), the mah was 
 requested to file a type ii variation to update the spc as follows:</p><p>
 - 
 “the treatment with dasatinib is associated with the important adverse reaction 
 myelosuppression. in section 4.4. special warnings and precautions for use it says 
 &quot;myelosuppression: treatment with sprycel is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and 
 thrombocytopenia&quot;.</p><p>under section 4.8. only neutropenia is mentioned under blood and 
 lymphatic system disorders. the spc should be updated to also include anaemia and 
 thrombocytopeniain in section 4.8.</p><p>
 - 
 the event gastrointestinal haemorrhage is only mentioned in the spc under the adverse reaction 
 &quot;vascular disorders&quot;. even though most bleeding related events seen in the treatment with 
 dasatinib are associated with severe thrombocytopenia, which encourages that gastrointestinal 
 bleeding is mentioned under this section, several reported bleeding disorders are related to 
 gastrointestinal disorders. it is therefore recommended that gastrointestinal bleeding should be 
 mentioned under this soc as well. therefore the spc should be updated accordingly in section 
 4.8.</p><p>
 - 
 the event cerebral haemorrhage is only mentioned in the spc under the adverse reaction 
 &quot;vascular disorders&quot;.</p><p>most bleeding related events seen in the treatment with dasatinib are 
 associated with severe thrombocytopenia, which is already stated in the spc.</p><p>but since several 
 reported bleeding disorders are related to the event cerebral haemorrhage the event should be 
 specified in point 4.8 in the spc. it is recommended that the spc should be updated under point 
 4.8. to specify the event cerebral haemorrhage under the soc nervous system disorders as 
 well. in point 4.4 and 4.8 of the spc it states &quot;cns hemorrhage occurred in 1% of patients. 
 three cases were fatal and 2 of them were associated with ctc grade 4 thrombocytopenia…&quot; 
 the mah states that 5 fatal cases related to cerebral hemorrhage during the review period, it 
 seems that section 4.4 of the spc should be updated to include these fatal events. “</p><p>
 the mah took the opportunity of this type ii variation to update section 4.8 of the spc in line with 
 the outcome of the chmp assessment of the 1
 st psur and according to meddra version 8.2. the package leaflet has been amended accordingly.</p></section><section><header>benefit/risk assessment</header><p>dasatinib offers a therapeutic advance for subjects with cml or ph+ all who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. results from the dasatinib phase 1 and phase 2 program showed that subjects 
 with all phases of cml or ph+ all achieve durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses. 
 myelosuppression and fluid retention were identified as the most important toxicities in the phase 1 
 17 and phase 2 studies. recovery from myelosuppression and fluid retention-related aes were managed in most cases by dose interruptions, dose reductions, or supportive care.</p><p>
 previous findings from phase 1 assessing bid and qd dose regimens among subjects with chronic 
 phase cml, showed similar efficacy with a suggestion of improved safety for the qd regimen; 
 however, the study was not designed to compare dosing schedules. in an attempt to improve the safety 
 profile of dasatinb while maintaining efficacy, studies ca180034 and ca180035 were undertaken as 
 a post-marketing commitment (fum 010) to assess alternate doses and regimens to minimize the risk 
 associated with the administration of dasatinib.</p><p>
 results from the two phase iii trials included in this application showed evidence of substantial and 
 durable hematologic and cytogenetic response rates in subjects with chronic phase cml who failed 
 imatinib because of progression or intolerance. these data demonstrate that a dose of 100 mg qd has 
 comparable efficacy with the currently approved dose of 70 mg bid, but were associated with 
 improved and clinically relevant less toxicity. the proposed change in posolgy for chronic phase cml 
 recommending 100 mg qd as starting dose has a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than the current 70 
 mg bid and should in the opinion of the chmp be approved.</p><p>
 in subjects with advanced phase cml and ph+ all, despite an improvement in the safety profile of 
 dastinib, a recommendation for alternative dosing will require further assessment of the durability of 
 hematologic and cytogenetic responses.</p><p>
 the mah has forwarded an updated risk management plan, which is considered acceptable.</p><p>
 both studies (ca180034 and ca180035) are still ongoing and the mah should still provide the final 
 (24 month) results of both studies when available (fum 010).</p><p>in addition, the mah took the opportunity of this type ii variation to update section 4.8 of the spc in 
 line with the outcome of the chmp assessment of the 1
 st psur and according to meddra version 8.2. the package leaflet has been amended accordingly. further, the mah have implemented some 
 minor editorial changes in the annexes and updated the contact details of the local representatives for 
 romania and denmark in the package leaflet.</p></section><section><header>conclusion</header><p>- on 19 july 2007 the chmp considered this type ii variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
 amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package 
 leaflet.</p></section></body></xml>
