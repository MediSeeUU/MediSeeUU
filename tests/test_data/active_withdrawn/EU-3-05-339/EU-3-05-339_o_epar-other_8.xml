 during the use of dasatinib, stevens-johnsons syndrome (sjs), toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) and 
 erythema multiforme (em) were rarely observed. evidence has been presented including positive 
 de-challenge and re-challenge of severe skin reactions (em and sjs) with dasatinib, but so far the reports 
 have been rare. given the rarity of these symptoms, establishment of causality based on a solid number 
 of clinical cases is limited. nevertheless, toxic skin reactions are expected adrs reported with other 
 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) and it is therefore recommended that section 4.8 of the smpc of 
 dasatinib is updated to include steven-johnson syndrome as a new adverse drug reaction with the 
 frequency “not known”. the package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
 therefore, in view of available data regarding severe skin reactions the prac considered that changes to 
 the product information were warranted.</p><p>
 the chmp agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the prac.</p></section><section><header>grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation</header><p>on the basis of the scientific conclusions for sprycel, the chmp is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance dasatinib is favourable subject to the 
 proposed changes to the product information. 
 the chmp recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.</p></section></body></xml>
