 annex ii.a has been updated to remove the text regarding 
 the time-limited exemption allowing reliance on batch 
 control testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are 
 located in a third country. the  transfer of the finished 
 product quality control testing release test methods to 
 laboratories located in the eu has been completed.

 ii and pl 
 as a result of this group of quality  variations, all specific 
 obligations laid down in annex ii have been fulfilled and 
 comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-risk 
 balance of the medicinal product ervebo.
  pursuant to article 14-a(8) of regulation (ec) no 
 726/2004, the chmp recommends by consensus the 
 granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with 
 article 14(1) of regulation (ec) no 726/2004 for ervebo.
  consequently, section 5.1 of the smpc has been updated 
 to delete the reference to “conditional approval” scheme 
      page 5/8  and annex ii e has been updated to delete specification obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for 
 the conditional marketing authorisation. the package 
 leaflet is updated accordingly.
  due to extensive commercial confidential information 
 enclosed in the assessment report for quality variations,  
 this is not available to public access.

 protocol 018 was a phase 3 open-label trial conducted in 
 guinea to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
 ervebo in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and 
 older that was implemented as part b of the phase 3 ring 
 vaccination study for protocol 010. in this trial, a total of 
 2,115 subjects were enrolled and 2,016 subjects were 
 vaccinated with ervebo. an immunogenicity sub-study 
 included 1,217 subjects who were vaccinated and provided 
 samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.
  immunogenicity data were obtained in protocol 009 in 
 liberia, protocol 011 in sierra leone, protocol 012 in the 
 united states, canada, and europe, and protocol 018 in 
 guinea. gamma irradiation of specimens (from regions 
 involved in ebola outbreaks) was performed to reduce risk 
 of wild-type ebola virus infection of laboratory workers, but 
 increased pre-vaccination gp-elisa immune responses by 
 approximately 20% and decreased post-vaccination gp-
 elisa and prnt immune responses by approximately 20%. 
 gamma irradiation, baseline seropositivity and other factors 
 result in a higher immune response in protocol 012.

 changes in the package leaflet following the 
 assessment of the user acceptance test, procedure 
 emea/h/c/004554/rec/011. with the 
 implementation of these changes to the pl, the mah 
 fulfils rec011. in addition, minor editorial changes 
 have been included in the smpc and patient leaflet.

 annex ii 
 the chmp, having reviewed the available information on 
 the status of the fulfilment of specific obligations and 
 having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
 opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
      page 7/8 medicinal product continue to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
 renewal of the conditional ma for ervebo, subject to the 
 specific obligations and conditions as laid down in annex ii 
 to the opinion.
   the chmp considered that process validation data were 
 provided demonstrating that the active substance process 
 is properly validated. comparability data confirmed that the 
 commercial product manufactured at the burgwedel site is 
 representative of the material used in the clinical trials. 
 additional qualification data were provided for a critical 
 reagent used in the identity test ensuring proper quality 
 control of the active substance and the finished product. an 
 in-process control for total protein with appropriate 
 acceptance was introduced for the active substance, 
 ensuring proper quality control of the active substance. 
 based on the data submitted, the chmp concluded that the 
 respective specific obligations have been resolved and can 
 be deleted from the annex ii.
