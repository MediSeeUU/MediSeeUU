 (evd) caused by zaire ebola virus. 
 eligibility to prime was granted at the time based on the following: 
 •</p><p>in view of the very high case-fatality rate of evd and of the fact that no approved method to 
 prevent or treat evd currently exists, it was agreed that prevention of evd is currently an unmet 
 medical need. 
 •</p><p>based on the presented data (supportive non-clinical profile, antibody response to the product 
 shown by elisa and virus neutralization assays in phase 1 studies, interim analysis of the phase 
 3 ring vaccination trial, preliminary safety data collected in the clinical studies conducted to date), 
 chmp agreed that v920 has the potential to address the identified unmet need. 
 •</p><p>despite the late stage of development, additional discussions between the eu regulators and 
 who are foreseen (e.g. in the area of clinical trial design for future outbreaks, aspects regarding 
 correlates of protection, immunobridging).</p><p>
 upon granting of eligibility to prime, the rapporteur was appointed by the chmp. 
 a kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with the ema, rapporteur and assessors from relevant 
 scientific committees. the objective of the meeting was to discuss the development programme and 
 regulatory strategy for the product. the applicant was recommended to address the following key issues 
 through relevant regulatory procedures: limitations in the manufacturing process, clarification needed for 
 assay validation and immunogenicity data (including correlation of protection), clarification on proposed 
 indication wording and pre/post-exposure prophylaxis, long-term duration of efficacy, studies in special 
 populations, paediatric investigation plan, risk management plan and planning of post-authorisation

 disease or condition</header><p>ebola virus disease (evd) is a serious illness that originated in africa. the first ebola disease outbreaks were reported back in 1976. since then more than 30 outbreaks have occurred in africa with more than 
 30,000 people affected by the disease and almost 15,000 deaths. the first evd outbreaks occurred in 
 remote villages in central africa, near tropical rainforests. the 2014–2016 outbreak in west africa 
 involved major urban areas as well as rural ones and was declared a public health emergency of 
 international concern (pheic) by who. the causative agent of the disease is the ebola virus, a 
 negative-stranded rna virus belonging to the 
 filoviridae family. ebola virus infection causes an acute often serious illness with variable -but usually high- case fatality rate. the average evd case fatality rate 
 is around 50% but rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks depending on the virus species 
 involved. the virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population 
 through human-to-human transmission. 
 on 01 august 2018 the ministry of health of the democratic republic of the congo (drc) declared a new 
 outbreak of evd in north kivu province, which is currently ongoing. as of 17 october 2019, 3,228 cases 
 of disease have been reported with a death toll of 2,157 cases.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology</header><p>since the initial identification of ebola viruses in 1976, more than 20 outbreaks of ebola disease have been reported in sub-saharan africa, mostly in sudan, uganda, democratic republic of congo and 
 gabon. most of these outbreaks have occurred in isolated rural areas, but the outbreak in gulu in 2000 
 was in a semi-urban area of uganda. it is conceivable that smaller outbreaks might not have been 
 detected. the largest ebola outbreak to date occurred in 2014–16 in west africa, predominantly affecting 
 both rural and urban areas in guinea, sierra leone, and liberia with very high incidence and mortality 
 (&gt;28 000 cases with &gt;11 000 deaths). due to potential under-reporting the true burden of disease might 
 have been even higher. in this outbreak, the overall mean case fatality rate in confirmed cases with 
 recorded clinical outcomes was 62.9%. the epidemic peaked in august through october 2014. in march 
 2016, the who declared the end of the public health emergency of international concern (pheic). sierra 
 leone was declared free of ebola transmission in march 2016. after a few sporadic cases in liberia and 
 guinea in march/april 2016, these two countries were also declared free of ebola transmission in june 
 2016. 
 during the evaluation procedure, the world health organization declared the ongoing outbreak in drc a 
 public health emergency of international concern. 
 so far evd outbreaks have been restricted to african countries. however, there is a risk that the disease 
 could spread to other continents due to e.g. international travel or secondary infection from patients 
 coming from african countries (cases were reported in spain and the us). unfamiliarity with evd outside 
 of endemic areas can lead to delayed diagnosis of imported cases. 
 beyond the direct morbidity and mortality due to evd, large outbreaks of the disease have indirect effects 
 on population health based on the diversion of resources from programmes aimed at controlling other 
 diseases of major importance.</p><p>
 ebola virus disease is not an airborne disease and only symptomatic patients are contagious. as 
 transmission requires direct contact with bodily fluids, the risk of infection is considered very low if</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 12/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 precautions are strictly followed. the probability that eu/eea citizens living in or travelling to evd-affected areas of the drc will be exposed to the virus is low, provided they adhere to the 
 recommended precautionary measures. nosocomial transmission can occur. healthcare workers can be 
 infected through close contact with infected patients. however, health worker infections are preventable, 
 and the risk for infection can be significantly reduced through the appropriate use of infection control 
 precautions and adequate barrier procedures. 
 a preventive vaccine for evd could be used to protect individuals at high risk in advance of exposure and 
 also to interrupt transmission during an epidemic. since the monovalent v920 vaccine elicits rapid 
 immunity after a single dose, it has the potential for use as prophylactic vaccine to protect against evd 
 caused by ebola zaire virus.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 aetiology and pathogenesis</header></section><section><header>aetiology</header><p>ebolaviruses (ebov) belong to the genus ebolavirus of the filoviridae family in the order mononegavirales.</p><p>all members of this order possess a non-segmented, negative-sense rna genome of 19 kb with seven open reading frames, which is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (np). the np–rna complex acts as the template for genome replication and assembles into a helical nucleocapsid (nc) 
 along with accessory proteins. ebov has a striking, filamentous structure of about 800 nm in length and 
 80 nm in diameter. the helical nucleocapsid acquires an envelope by budding from the plasma membrane. the viral envelope contains spikes consisting of the glycoprotein (gp) trimer. this gp 
 molecule achieves the combined functions of attachment to host cells, endosomal entry, and membrane 
 fusion.</p><p>
 the genus ebolavirus of the 
 filoviridae family includes five species: bundibugyo ebolavirus, reston ebolavirus, sudan ebolavirus, tai forest ebolavirus, and zaire ebolavirus. among them, the zaire 
 ebolavirus, usually called ebola virus (ebov), is the main causative agent of human ebola virus disease 
 (evd) outbreaks. ebov persists in the environment in a still unidentified animal reservoir, most likely fruit 
 bats, which maintain the virus in an enzootic cycle. human infection represents a sporadic event taking 
 place in the context of a human-animal interface. transmission is mainly due to contact with blood or 
 body fluids from infected humans or animals.</p></section><section><header>pathogenesis</header><p>the major route of infection is through the mucosa or skin from where the virus reaches macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells, leading to spread to regional lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. macrophages 
 and monocytes stimulated by ebov release a “cytokine storm”, which in turn is responsible for damage to 
 tissues and blood vessels. death occurs due to blood loss and/or coagulation. coagulopathy occurs due to 
 thrombocytopenia, loss of anticoagulant protein c, destruction of clotting factors, and also due to 
 destruction of fibrin. damage to blood vessels causes disseminated intravascular coagulation as well as 
 renal failure. antibodies developed against ebov bind with the complement c1q and reach the binding 
 sites on dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to damage of these cells. lesions related to evd include 
 extensive haemorrhages of the mucosa, necrosis of different organs like liver, kidney, testes, and ovaries. 
 necrotic foci with inflammatory cells can be found in hepatic lobules, and there may be multinucleated 
 syncytia formation in the hepatic cells. necrosis of red pulp and fibrin deposition are the characteristic 
 lesions seen in the spleen. gastrointestinal tract shows mononuclear infiltration into the submucosa and 
 lamina propria. mild emphysema, oedema in the terminal alveoli, and stasis of blood can be noticed in the 
 lung parenchyma. it has also been shown that macrophages in the chambers of the eye, brain, and 
 epididymis are sites of viral persistence (sanctuary sites).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 clinical presentation, diagnosis and stages/prognosis</header></section><section><header>clinical presentation</header><p>ebola disease is a viral haemorrhagic fever affecting humans and other primates that is caused by infection with ebolaviruses. following an incubation period of 2–21 days, ebola disease typically starts as 
 a non-specific viral syndrome with abrupt onset. at this stage the most frequent symptoms are high fever, 
 malaise, fatigue, and body aches (early febrile or mild stage, 0-3 days). these symptoms usually develop 
 after a few days into gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea 
 (gastrointestinal involvement stage, 3-10 days). these manifestations can range from mild-to-severe, 
 with body fluid loss of up to 5–10 l/day. other, rarer, symptoms are cough and dyspnoea, conjunctival 
 injection, hiccups, or localised pain of chest, abdomen, muscles, or joints.</p><p>
 part of the patients may recover from this stage; others however will enter into deterioration of 
 symptoms, ultimately going into shock, possibly due to hypovolaemia and a systemic inflammatory 
 response. at this stage (complicated stage, 7-12 days), patients can present haemorrhagic events, such 
 as conjunctival bleeding, petechiae, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucosal haemorrhage. neurological 
 events are rare and include confusion, delirium, and convulsions. cases of ebola disease-related 
 encephalitis have been reported. other late symptoms include dysphagia, throat pain, and oral ulcers. a 
 maculopapular rash has been described. exceptionally, sudden death can occur in recovering patients, 
 possibly due to cardiac arrhythmias. if patients survive the stage of shock, gradual recovery can occur.</p><p>
 irrespective of the severity of the acute disease, ebola virus tends to persist, specifically in sites where 
 immune response is less effective (e.g. the eye, central nervous system, and testis). persistence is 
 associated with clinical sequelae, disease reactivation, long-term virus shedding, and virus transmission. 
 virus found in the seminal fluid can still be infectious and be sexually transmitted for more than a year 
 after disease onset. cases of women transmitting the virus via breastfeeding have been reported, 
 although the duration of infectivity by this route is unknown. reports suggest that other reservoirs and 
 other human-to-human transmission routes of persisting virus in humans could still be uncovered.</p><p>
 laboratory features include variable degrees of anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as changes in 
 number and type of white blood cells. renal dysfunction (in up to 50% of case) and substantial increases 
 in liver enzymes are common. likewise, creatine phosphokinase and amylase concentrations can be 
 increased. electrolyte abnormalities are common, especially hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and 
 hypocalcaemia. clotting tests can indicate a varying degree of intravascular coagulation. metabolic 
 acidosis can occur, particularly in cases of shock and renal failure. 
 high viral loads, combined with severe muscle breakdown and renal impairment, have consistently been 
 predictive of death. differences in severity of clinical events and outcome might exist between young 
 children, young adults, and older people. pregnant women face higher mortality and risk of miscarriage 
 and stillbirth. clinical presentation can be aggravated by concurrent comorbidities and infections, such as 
 malaria and bacterial sepsis. clinical signs and symptoms have varied across the different ebola 
 outbreaks reported during the last decades. this variation is at least partly due to the specific outbreak 
 context and the ebolavirus species involved. for example, haemorrhagic events were highly prevalent in 
 the 1976 outbreak in yambuku, but less so in many other outbreaks, including the 2013-2016 west 
 african one in which haemorrhage was uncommon. furthermore, during the west african outbreak, fever 
 was absent in at least 10% of the cases.</p></section><section><header>diagnosis</header><p>diagnosis of evd on the basis of clinical symptoms can be difficult as clinical manifestations are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. confirmation that 
 symptoms are caused by ebov infection are made using diagnostic laboratory methods:</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 • antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)</p><p>• antigen-capture detection tests • serum neutralization test • reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay • electron microscopy • virus isolation by cell culture rt-pcr tests were the cornerstone of the laboratory response during the 2014–16 west african outbreak. 
 however, for many years the main methods for detection of filoviruses has been virus isolation in cell 
 culture from patient specimens.</p><p>
 viral load peaks 3–7 days after the onset of symptoms. when patients with evd present at a hospital, 
 typically 3–6 days after the onset of the symptoms, the viral load is already high and detectable in the 
 patient’s blood by rt-pcr in most cases. in fatal cases, viremia is usually 10–100 folds higher than in 
 survivors. igg and igm humoral responses develop in survivors but not in all fatal cases thus, diagnosing 
 of evd using serology is only possible in a fraction of symptomatic patients and requires seroconversion 
 or a substantial increase in antibody titre in paired serum samples. however, serology is the method of 
 choice to diagnose asymptomatic ebola virus infections, which are characterised by extremely low viremia 
 and development of igg and igm about 3 weeks after infection. another technique also used for 
 post-mortem diagnosis is antigen detection by immunohistochemistry on a skin biopsy.</p><p> 
 during the acute phase of the disease and convalescence, viral rna can be detected by rt-pcr in other 
 body fluids, such as saliva, tears, sweat, breast milk, urine, csf, ocular fluid, amniotic fluid, vaginal fluid, 
 and seminal fluid. viral rna can remain detectable in these fluids after the rt-pcr on blood becomes 
 negative.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header></section><section><header>therapeutics</header><p>no specific treatment for evd is currently available. most investigational therapies for ebola virus disease aim at the reduction of viral replication to limit the inflammatory storm triggered by viral expansion. some 
 of these investigational treatments were tested during the 2014–16 ebola outbreak in west africa, but 
 clinical trials failed to confirm efficacy of any treatment. nevertheless, promising experimental 
 interventions were identified. therapeutics under investigation include zmapp (mapp 
 biopharmaceuticals), a drug comprised of 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mabs) manufactured in 
 nicotiana benthamiana, the nucleoside analogue inhibitors remdesivir (gs-5734; gilead sciences) and 
 bcx4430 (biocryst pharmaceuticals), the selective rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor favipiravir 
 (medivector), the mab cocktail regn3470-3471-3479 (regneb3; regeneron biopharma), and 
 single-therapy mab, vrc-ebomab092-00-ab (mab114; vaccine research centre, nih). recently 
 interim analysis information was released regarding the palm trial in drc, which is a randomized 
 controlled trial of four investigational agents (zmapp, remdesivir, mab114 and regn-eb3), based on 
 which rgn-eb3 and mab114 seem more promising. 
 in addition, effective drugs that pass the blood–brain barrier are needed for the management of clinical 
 recurrence of ebola virus disease and to penetrate immunologically and anatomically preserved sites and 
 reservoirs in survivors beyond the acute phase of the disease.</p><p>
 currently, management of evd patients consists on supportive and critical care. supportive care, i.e. 
 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. in</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 in addition to this application for ervebo, the adenovirus 26 vector ebov glycoprotein / mva-bn 
 (ad26.zebov/ mva-bn) vaccine regimen developed by janssen represents another candidate vaccine 
 that has recently been recommended by who sage after assessment of available data for use in the 
 ongoing drc outbreak in lower risk populations and with informed consent.</p><p>
 there is an urgent unmet medical need for efficacious and safe preventive vaccines.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>ervebo (or v920 vaccine as this report will refer to) is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) whose gene encoding for the vsv glycoprotein g has been replaced by the gene encoding for the zaire 
 ebola virus (kikwit strain) glycoprotein (rvsvδg-zebov-gp). the vaccine is a genetically engineered, 
 replication-competent, attenuated live vaccine that induces immune responses after a single dose. the 
 relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to protection from zaire 
 ebola virus are unknown. 
 the pharmacotherapeutic group is viral vaccines (atc code j07bx02).</p><p>
 the vaccine is manufactured in serum-free vero cell cultures. the virus is harvested from the cell culture 
 medium, purified, and frozen to produce the bulk drug substance (bds). the vaccine drug product is a 
 solution for injection manufactured by aseptic addition of the bds to the drug product stabilizer solution, 
 which contains 2.5 mg/ml rice derived recombinant human serum albumin (rhsa) and 10 mm tris buffer. 
 this vaccine contains a trace amount of rice protein. the vaccine must be transported and stored frozen 
 at -80°c to -60ºc. 
 the proposed indication for v920 is for active immunization of at-risk individuals 18 years of age and older 
 to protect against ebola virus disease caused by zaire ebola virus. 
 the proposed posology is 1 ml of ≥72 million plaque forming units (pfu) administered as a solution for 
 injection through intramuscular administration.</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>the chmp agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to be of major public health interest. this was based on i) the severity and mortality of the disease to be 
 prevented, ii) the unmet medical need due to lack of authorised vaccines or therapeutics for evd, iii) the 
 v920 efficacy and safety data, which indicated that the vaccine was immunogenic, protective and 
 generally well tolerated. although certain challenges with maintenance of an accelerated assessment 
 were identified in the pre-submission stage (e.g. generation of certain pharmaceutical data, a new 
 manufacturing site requiring conduct of an inspection during the assessment, and the suitability of batch 
 control testing sites), these limitations were accepted in the context of the urgent high unmet medical 
 need and promising clinical data. 
 during the assessment, the possibility of a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with article 
 14-a of regulation (ec) no 726/2004 was considered, taking into account the nature of the target 
 condition, emergency situation and applicant’s position on the following criteria:</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 • the benefit-risk balance is positive. • it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. the applicant provided an exhaustive plan to generate the final process validation and comparability data for v920 drug 
 substance and drug product, which would enable through the fulfilment of the sos to submit an 
 application to convert the cma into a full registration by october 2020. the applicant´s ability to 
 provide a comprehensive quality dossier is also supported by the two gmp inspections carried out 
 at burgwedel biotech gmbh (burgwedel) in march 2019 and july 2019 by the local health 
 authority gaa, which led to the issuance of gmp certificates and mia for the site in question. the 
 applicant considers that the final process validation and comparability reports will confirm the 
 positive benefit-risk assessment of v920 and define a comprehensive quality dossier for the 
 medicinal product. the specific obligations proposed by the applicant in annex ii of the smpc 
 (section e) define stringent regulatory oversight to ensure submission of emerging cmc 
 information in a specific timeframe. moreover, the applicant will continue to maintain the ema and 
 all other stakeholders updated about any acceleration of the manufacturing schedule in 
 consideration of the ongoing evd emergency. 
 • unmet medical needs will be addressed, as v920 has shown to have high protective efficacy and effectiveness in the prevention of evd, and the data submitted in the framework of the maa 
 procedure demonstrate that the vaccine has the potential to fulfil unmet medical needs both in 
 endemic and non-endemic regions. in addition v920 was generally well tolerated and had a 
 favourable safety profile.</p><p>
 • the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. ebola virus is a serious pathogen responsible for an unprecedented 
 epidemic in west africa in 2014-2016, which led to a case fatality rate of approximately 40%. 
 recently, the who declared a pheic in the democratic republic of congo (drc – north kivu) due to 
 the ongoing outbreak of evd in that region. the cma would ensure expedited eu approval, and this 
 will translate into an accelerated who prequalification step and consequent early collaborative 
 registration by avaref countries. it would also ensure earlier availability of licensed supplies to 
 african countries on the grounds that an expedited approval of the artwork will allow faster ramp-up 
 of manufacturing activities and supply of licensed doses. use of a licensed product will remove the 
 requirements for gcp training and informed consent, which will accelerate the public health 
 response. furthermore, use of a licensed product will support vaccination of european health care 
 workers who are being deployed to support the african outbreak currently ongoing under emergency 
 frameworks in some european countries. the applicant is ensuring that v920 is consistently 
 produced and controlled according to quality standards and is minimizing the risks involved in 
 pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. the adoption 
 of the cma, together with the current accelerated review timetable, will translate into a significant 
 benefit from a public health perspective, which is supported by the overall evidence generated.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.

 general information</header><p>the active substance (as) (also referred to as the bulk active substance-bas), (rvsvδg-zebov-gp, live attenuated) is a live, recombinant viral vaccine. 
 the ebola zaire vaccine (rvsvδg-zebov-gp, live attenuated) is a recombinant virus consisting of a 
 single recombinant vsv isolate (11481 nt, strain indiana) with the gene for the zaire ebolavirus gp 
 (zebov-gp), kikwit strain replacing the gene for the vsv-gp, which has been deleted. this results in a 
 vsv backbone with the zebov-gp constituting the envelope of the virus. as for similar chimeric vaccines, 
 substitution of the native virus gp with a heterologous gp leads to significant attenuation of the virus.</p><p>
 the active substance of ervebo has never been registered in the european union and is qualified as a new

 thawing of a vial of the vero working cell bank (wcb). vero cells are expanded (first steps in flasks, then 
 in roller bottles) via several passaging steps. when a sufficiently high number of cells have been achieved, 
 cells are infected with the master virus seed (mvs). after incubation, the supernatant fluid (containing 
 the recombinant virus) is harvested. the harvest is clarified using depth filtration. subsequently, the 
 clarified harvest is treated with benzonase (enzyme to digest residual vero cell dna). the resulting 
 intermediate is called the reacted viral harvest, which is further purified and concentrated via 
 ultrafiltration/diafiltration. the ultrafiltered product (ufp) is then formulated into bas by addition of tris 
 (trometamol) buffer and recombinant human serum albumin (rhsa). after mixing, the bas is filled in</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 composition of the media used during manufacturing is provided. irradiated bovine serum 
 (bse/tse-free) was used for development and cryopreservation of the mcb. 
 no materials of primary human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of bas. two raw materials, 
 vp-sfm 1x and benzonase, utilise animal-derived components in their manufacturing processes. based 
 on the manufacturing processes and the testing, the risk for viral contamination is considered to be 
 negligible. 
 vp-sfm 1x medium contains recombinant human insulin which is derived through yeast (
 pichia pastoris) fermentation. during purification of insulin, porcine pancrease trypsin is used. the porcine trypsin is 
 obtained from usda licensed facilities sourced from healthy animals of usa origin. porcine trypsin 
 undergoes a low ph hold step employed for viral inactivation purposes and does not incorporate the use 
 of bovine lactose. 
 benzonase is an enzyme derived from 
 e. coli fermentation. the medium used for e. coli fermentation contains casamino acids derived from bovine milk sourced from healthy animals in australia and new 
 zealand. casamino acids are isolated using low ph conditions at elevated temperature for an extended 
 period of time followed by oven drying at high heat for an additional extended time. furthermore, the 
 medium containing the casamino acids is sterilised-in-place using elevated temperature and pressure. 
 quality of the raw materials was adequately described (compliant with ph.eur. or controlled by in-house 
 specifications). 
 the master cell bank (mcb) was manufactured by idt biologika gmbh using the who reference cell bank 
 as starting material. cells are stored frozen and kept in cryopreservation medium containing 30% 
 irradiated fetal bovine serum and 10% dmso. the mcb was extensively tested for qualification.</p><p>
 the working cell bank (wcb) was manufactured by merck, west point, usa using the idt mcb as starting 
 material. cells are stored frozen in serum-free medium containing 20% dmso in the vapour phase of 
 liquid nitrogen. the wcb was extensively tested for qualification. some further testing to complete 
 qualification is required (see list of specific obligations). the testing plan for the wcb included in the ctd 
 is deemed sufficient. 
 the cloning of the rvsv zebov-gp virus consists of reverse genetics placing the zebov envelope 
 glycoprotein gene into the genome of the indiana strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) as a 
 substitution for the fusogenic vsv–g envelope glycoprotein. one clone was selected to become the 
 premaster virus and was tested and then amplified with cells from the vero mcb to create the pre-master 
 virus seed. vero cells sourced from the master cell bank were expanded (in serum-free medium) and used 
 to manufacture the master virus seed (mvs) which is stored frozen at -80 to -60 °c. the msv was 
 extensively tested for qualification. genetic stability was demonstrated from master virus seed to one 
 viral passage beyond gmp manufacturing level. a wvs has been established. this wvs will be qualified 
 and implemented via a variation procedure post approval in order to have a two-tiered virus seed system 
 but in the meantime, it is acceptable to initiate the manufacturing process directly from the msv.</p></section><section><header>control of critical steps and intermediates</header><p>critical process parameters (cpps) are defined as process parameters that must be controlled and/or monitored within an established range to ensure quality attributes are met. a critical quality attribute</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests.</p></section><section><header>process validation</header><p>as process validation-pv (or process performance qualification- ppq) results are only partially available. process validation for as is still ongoing. data from 1 representative as lot and 1 engineering batch 
 (which may be considered as representative) were provided. for these lots, the process operated within 
 acceptable limits and the qc test results were within the acceptance criteria and compliant with the 
 specifications. the burgwedel commercial process is identical to the west point clinical lot process (also 
 produced at the same scale). as such, if controlled according to the described control strategy, the 
 process is expected to yield as of the same quality as at the west point site. west point material produced 
 thus far has been shown to be of adequate and consistent quality. taken together, these data are 
 considered to be sufficient to support granting of a conditional marketing authorisation (cma) at this point 
 in time. additional as ppq data are requested to be provided post-approval to complete the process 
 validation dataset for the active substance as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation (see 
 discussion section for more detail). 
 results from container-closure integrity and extractable/ leachable studies have been provided and are 
 considered to be adequate.</p></section><section><header>manufacturing process development</header><p>the bulk active substance (bas) manufacturing process was developed in three stages. the bas manufacturing process was initially developed at idt biologika, germany. at idt biologika, a 
 total of thirteen bas lots and ten finished product lots (fp) were manufactured. five of the fp lots were 
 utilised in clinical trials, including the ring vaccination trial conducted in guinea during the 2014-2016 
 outbreaks. 
 the bas process was slightly modified, upscaled and transferred to merck west point (pa, us). additional 
 clinical batches were manufactured at merck west point. the bas manufacturing campaign included four 
 lots, which were manufactured with a modified process from idt biologika. analysis of bas lots 
 manufactured by idt biologika and merck west point indicated that both processes generated 
 comparable bas. the manufacturing process developed at idt biologika involved cell culture utilising a 
 vero mcb and infection using a mvs, both manufactured by idt biologika. however, merck west 
 point-eual lots utilised a working cell bank (wcb) that was manufactured at merck west point which was 
 derived from the idt biologika mcb. merck emergency use assessment and listing (eual) lots utilised the 
 mvs manufactured by idt biologika. 
 the active substance for the commercial product will be manufactured at the burgwedel site (germany). 
 only minor modifications were introduced in the burgwedel process (same scale as merck west point 
 process). 
 although fp lots that comply with the specifications (formulated using within-specification as lots) are 
 expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches, comparability between clinical 
 material and commercial bas/fp from burgwedel needs to be formally demonstrated. these data are 
 requested to be provided post-approval as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 idt biologika developed a potency assay (plaque assay), which was used to release clinical materials. a different version of the plaque assay has since been validated at eurofins lancaster laboratories, inc. 
 (elli, lancaster, pa) and will be used for commercial release testing and all future stability studies. the 
 elli potency method was developed by msd based on the initial plaque assay used at idt biologika with 
 several changes. both methods have been validated. although both methods generate reportable results 
 using pfu/ml as the unit of measure, the two methods are independent of each other and differ in a 
 variety of parameters such as test vessel, cell incubation time and incubation time post inoculation. 
 furthermore, there is no reference standard to which results are adjusted, thus differences due to 
 multiple factors may result in different reportable potencies. according to the company, the urgent timing 
 associated with the development of this product to support the manufacture of emergency use material 
 did not allow for a complete bridging study powered to support commercial manufacture. the estimated 
 difference between the two methods was calculated and indicating that the elli results are overall slightly 
 higher than the idt biologika results. this estimated difference was calculated based on data obtained for 
 3 as batches. in order to generate potency specifications that are linked to clinical efficacy and safety, 
 clinical batches released using the idt potency assay were retested using the validated elli potency 
 assay. since long term stability studies to date have shown no loss in potency, the geometric mean of all 
 of the time points has been calculated for the idt assay results. the values obtained through the retest 
 at elli in comparison with the long-term stability data from idt biologika are consistent with the 
 difference calculated between the methods. the difference between the two methods was slightly larger 
 than initially observed when comparing 3 as lots. however, this difference can be considered a 
 consequence of the assay variability and is therefore not unexpected. overall, therefore use of the 
 validated elli potency method for commercial testing is justified.</p><p>
 the applicant has provided the individual batch data (including results for cqas, total protein, host cell 
 protein, host cell dna, tryple activity (residual medium), residual benzonase and aggregate analysis, 
 when available) of all as batches produced by idt biologika and by merck west point. it was indicated 
 which batches have been used in the clinical trials (that were found to meet the clinical parameters for 
 safety and efficacy), as well as which batches have been used in the democratic republic of congo. it was 
 also clearly indicated which potency assay was used for each of these batches. batches met specifications 
 in force at the time.</p></section><section><header>characterisation</header><p>two distinct genetic stability assessments have been performed. virus produced at 3 consecutive viral passage levels was sequenced. no consensus nucleotide changes were observed. the applicant provided 
 a detailed description of the genetic stability analysis of the recombinant virus.</p><p>
 the amount of free ebola glycoprotein was evaluated as a possible cqa. it is suggested that free ebola gp 
 (shed gp, sgp) could result in some of the pathogenic effects of ebola infection. when examining the 
 vaccine sequence, it was determined that the coding region is predicted to preferentially translate the full 
 gp and not the sgp construct. furthermore, the downstream purification will significantly reduce any 
 free/soluble protein such as the free-gp in the final bas. since other markers of protein clearance have 
 been evaluated during analytical comparability between the idt biologika manufacturing process and 
 msd site-burgwedel biotech gmbh manufacturing process, it was concluded that the free ebola-gp itself 
 is not considered a cqa. 
 particle distribution and aggregation have been assessed. flow cytometry-based analysis shows no 
 observable aggregation. the results also show no apparent change in the viral particle size or distribution 
 after storage at 37°c for 24 hours, while the plaque assay shows a significant decrease in the infectivity 
 of this material.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 a comparison of the genome quantification data and genome particles/plaque forming units (pfu) ratios was performed. the genome copy:pfu ratio appears consistent across different lots manufactured at 
 different facilities and different scales. 
 potency was assessed on various bas lots at different stages during production (harvest, clarified 
 harvest, reacted harvest, bulk active substance). potency was shown to be consistent between different 
 lots for all stages. 
 harvested virus fluid samples from the ppq campaign were subjected to next generation sequencing to 
 provide evidence of virus identity and genetic stability. 
 measurement of process residuals and host cell impurities (hcp) during process development has 
 demonstrated sufficient removal of impurities during the bas process. the consistency of benzonase and 
 host cell protein (hcp) clearance through the ultrafiltration process was shown. hcp clearance was 
 determined to be &gt;93%, thus reducing hcp to clearly acceptable levels in the ng/ml range. furthermore, 
 benzonase clearance (&gt;99%) may be an appropriate surrogate for hcp clearance, given the consistent 
 patterns observed for the two markers. the following residuals and host cell impurities are assumed to be 
 cleared similarly to benzonase (~30 kda), a surrogate for similar and smaller molecular weight 
 impurities: tryple, edta and trypsin inhibitor. stated impurities have been present in product used in 
 clinical trials. 
 characterisation has been performed for as material from idt biologika and/or merck west point. the 
 active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
 methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure.</p></section><section><header>specification</header><p>the as release specifications are presented. release tests include testing on control cells and the harvested control fluids (cell culture), on the harvest and on the bulk active substance.</p><p>
 host cell dna and residual benzonase content are considered important quality attributes of the active 
 substance that should at least be determined until enough evidence has been generated to conclude on 
 the robust and reliable reduction of these impurities below an acceptable limit. the applicant has included 
 testing for host cell dna and residual benzonase as an in-process control (ipc) with acceptance criteria. 
 upon demonstration of consistency on a sufficiently high number of batches, these routine tests may be 
 removed. 
 as regards host cell protein, the applicant will monitor hcp via total protein analysis at the level of the

 potency assay: the potency of the bas is obtained using a plaque assay. the plaque assay is a test in which a dilute solution of virus is applied to a tissue culture dish containing a layer of host cells. after 
 incubation, cells are stained for visualisation and the plaques are counted. the number of infective virus 
 particles in the original solution is estimated based on the number of plaques.</p><p>
 identity assay: for the identity assay, a plaque assay (similar to the potency assay) is performed which is followed by an immunostaining. 100% of the plaques must be positive by immunostaining to confirm 
 the identity of the sample as ebola zaire bas. because of the criticality of the polyclonal antibody (used 
 for identity release test), additional data is required to complete the qualification. as part of the 
 qualification of the polyclonal antibody therefore, to demonstrate the specificity of the polyclonal antibody, 
 the company should also include a negative control with vero cells infected with wild type vesicular 
 stomatitis virus: these should also yield a negative result (see list of specific obligations).

 the fp has been manufactured at the following facilities: 1) idt biologika gmbh, germany; 2) merck west point, pennsylvania; 3) msd site-burgwedel biotech gmbh, germany. 
 there have been no major changes during the manufacturing process development. for the first batches, 
 different stopper material and already sterilised buffer has been used. there are small differences 
 between the manufacturing processes in west point and burgwedel, which are considered to be marginal. 
 in addition, there have been no changes in the product composition or pharmaceutical form during 
 development. a risk assessment approach was used throughout the development of the fp manufacturing 
 process. the purpose of the process risk assessments were as follows: 1) identify parameters that are 
 most likely to impact product quality and process performance to guide and prioritise the focus of process 
 development and process performance qualification readiness activities; 2) understand and document 
 the relationship between product and process attributes and process parameters and materials; 3) 
 identify process failure modes and mitigation plans to support the process control strategy.</p><p>development 
 studies were identified and executed based on the initial risk assessment.</p><p> 
 as already stated, idt biologika developed the potency assay (plaque assay), which was used to release 
 clinical materials and a different version of the plaque assay was validated at eurofins lancaster 
 laboratories, inc. (elli, lancaster, pa) to be used for commercial release testing and all future stability 
 studies. the elli potency method was developed by msd based on the initial plaque assay used at idt 
 biologika with several changes to ensure a robust method. both methods have been validated. the results 
 obtained by the elli method are slightly higher than those obtained by the idt method (but still within 
 method variability). this is acceptable. 
 the fp container closure system consists of a 2r type-1 class b borosilicate clear glass tubing vial 
 (compliant with ph.eur), a 13 mm chlorobutyl stopper (compliant with ph.eur) and a 13 mm flip-off 
 aluminium seal. extractables testing of the vials and the stoppers has been performed.</p><p>
 ervebo is provided in single-dose vials without preservative. the fp is manufactured by aseptic addition 
 of sterile bas and fp stabiliser solution. the formulated bulk is aseptically filled into vials. sterility testing 
 is included as part of release testing. process simulations verify the robustness of the aseptic processing 
 steps. additional integrity of the filled vials is provided by container closure integrity (cci) validation.</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product and process controls product specification</header><p>the fp release and stability specifications are provided and include appropriate specifications for identity, potency, purity and physico-chemical attributes. the proposed specifications are considered to be

 parameters for safety and efficacy), as well as batches that have been used in the democratic republic of 
 congo. batch data complied with specifications in force at that time. it was also clearly indicated which 
 potency assay was used for each of these batches. the applicant should provide the fp batch analysis 
 data of the ppq batches (burgwedel site) (see list of specific obligations). 
 regarding impurities, residual host cell dna and residual benzonase tests are performed on bas but the 
 acceptance criteria are applied to the final filled container by calculation. the potential risks related to 
 elemental impurities have been suitably evaluated. no additional impurities are introduced in the 
 formulation and filling process of ervebo.</p></section><section><header>reference materials</header><p>no reference standards are used in testing of the fp. however appropriate positive controls (which need to be within established acceptance criteria) are used to verify validity of the potency assay in order to

 more historical lots become available. 
 the applicant has provided stability data for the idt biologika lots and merck west point lots. stability 
 data for fp from the commercial burgwedel site will be provided post-approval. for the stability testing of 
 the 3 fp ppq lots from burgwedel, the applicant will also include identity testing. the identity assay does 
 not only serve to confirm correct identity but also to complement the potency assay. the pfu assay 
 (proposed potency assay) only measures the titre of the recombinant virus but does not provide 
 information about the expression of the gp. as such, a combination of the potency assay (pfu assay) and 
 identity assay (gp immunostaining) is considered necessary to properly assess potency during shelf life 
 (stability testing). 
 real time stability data (below -60°c) are available up to 48 months for 8 idt biologika lots and 3 merck 
 west point lots. all results comply with the specifications. no decrease or trend is observed for potency 
 (also not at accelerated conditions, i.e. at -40°c).</p><p>
 preliminary evaluation indicated that the vaccine product may be sensitive to light exposure. the 
 secondary packaging (market box) is expected to protect vaccine vials from light. samples from full scale 
 batches will be subjected to a confirmatory photo-stability study and to demonstrate that the secondary 
 packaging (market box) protects the fp from light exposure. the smpc states that the vial should be kept 
 in the outer carton in order to protect from light.</p><p>
 the smpc also states ‘after thawing, the vaccine should be used immediately; however, in-use stability 
 data have demonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2°c to 8°c prior 
 to use. at the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. upon removal from the freezer, 
 the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and also a new 
 discard date (in place of the labelled expiry date). once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen.’ 
 confirmatory studies will be performed to support post-thaw product exposure to elevated temperature 
 and exposure times. a total of 2 weeks at 2–8°c and 4 hours at up to 25°c are supported by the potency</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the stability data support the proposed shelf life of 3 years. a shelf life of 3 years for the commercial fp 
 is therefore acceptable. comparability must however be comprehensively demonstrated between 
 burgwedel batches and as/fp material from idt and west point. these data are requested 
 post-authorisation as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation.</p></section><section><header>adventitious agents</header><p>cell substrates, virus seeds, and raw materials used during manufacture of ervebo are rigorously tested, using validated methods, to provide high confidence that extraneous agents are not present in the fp. the 
 seed viruses are derived from vero cell systems under conditions similar to those used in the vaccine bulk 
 production. two raw materials, namely vp-sfm 1x (which contains recombinant human insulin which 
 itself uses porcine trypsin in its manufacture and also used for cell bank establishment) and benzonase 
 (produced using bovine milk fit for human consumption), utilise animal-derived components in their 
 respective manufacturing processes. vp-sfm 1x is used during cell bank and active substance 
 manufacture and benzonase only in as manufacture. the master virus seed and the cell bank system 
 were properly tested. no animal-derived materials are used in the manufacturing processes of as and fp. 
 risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) contamination is negligible. irradiated bovine serum 
 was used for development and cryopreservation of the mcb.</p><p>
 during as/fp production, various routine testing is performed to guarantee the absence of adventitious 
 agents. bas is tested for sterility; the virus harvest is tested for sterility, mycoplasma, mycobacteria, 
 retrovirus and adventitious agents (
 in vitro tests); control cells (from virus culture) are tested for sterility, mycoplasma and adventitious agents (
 in vitro and in vivo tests). fp is tested for sterility and endotoxin.</p></section><section><header>gmo</header><p>please refer to the non-clinical era evaluation for the gmo evaluation.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.4">2.2.4.  
 discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>during the procedure, a number of deficiencies were highlighted relating to: the manufacturing and importation authorisation (mia) and gmp certificate for the active substance (as) and finished product 
 (fp) manufacturing site, process validation for as and fp and comparability data; impurity testing; 
 completion of viral safety testing of the master cell bank (mcb) and working cell bank (wcb) and 
 additional qualification of a reagent used in the identity assay. these deficiencies were classified as major 
 objections (mos) in order to ensure completion of the data set by the applicant at appropriate time 
 points, e.g. as specific obligations, see below. as a result, the marketing authorisation is conditional on 
 the applicant providing responses to the requested data. 
 the gmp / mia for the as/fp site was subsequently granted and this mo was therefore resolved.</p><p>
 data have been submitted by the company during the procedure in relation to the other mos and chmp 
 has considered that these data would support grant of a conditional marketing authorisation (cma) on 
 quality grounds, taking into account the public health emergency of international concern declared by 
 who. however, a number of specific obligations (sos) are needed in order to complete the manufacturing 
 process details. 
 a summary of the status of the information, including the specific obligations and their rationale and 
 additional recommendations for further development are discussed below.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 27/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 specific obligations stability data were provided for clinical as and fp lots. the currently available stability data support an as shelf life of 36 months and a fp shelf life of 36 months. however, these stability data were derived from 
 idt and west point batches (clinical batches). in the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation, 
 a shelf life of 36 months can be granted for the commercial product (as and fp). however, it is expected 
 that comparability is comprehensively demonstrated post-approval between commercial and clinical 
 batches (see list of specific obligations) in order to confirm the shelf life of the commercial product. 
 furthermore, given the limited experience of the burgwedel site with the manufacturing process, the 
 applicant is also requested to provide the as and fp stability data from the burgwedel as process 
 performance qualification (ppq) batches when the stability studies have been finished (post-approval) 
 (see list of recommendations). any out-of-specification (oos) results or trends should be communicated 
 to the authorities as soon as possible. in addition, to confirm the stability of the vaccine during a short 
 time exposure to elevated temperatures, also the results of the post-thaw fp stability data from the 36 
 month time point should be provided (post-approval) when these are available (see list of 
 recommendations). 
 process validation (or process performance qualification) for both as and fp is still ongoing. data from 1 
 representative as lot and 1 representative fp lot were provided. for these lots, the process operated 
 within acceptable limits and the qc test results were within the acceptance criteria and compliant with the 
 specifications and support grant of a conditional marketing authorisation. unexpected issues arose during 
 as ppq , delaying the availability of complete as ppq data. however, the root cause of the problem has 
 been identified and proper measures have been taken to avoid similar problems in the future. this was 
 discussed during the gmp inspection and the measures were deemed acceptable by the gmp inspectors.</p><p>
 the burgwedel commercial process is identical to the west point clinical lot process (also produced at the 
 same scale). as such, with the described control strategy in place, the process is expected to yield as of 
 the same quality as at the west point site. west point material produced thus far has been shown to be 
 of adequate and consistent quality. however, chmp is of the view that two further active substance lots 
 (as ppq 4 and 5) are required to complete the information by providing sufficient comprehensive 
 evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform effectively and 
 reproducibly to produce the medicinal product, meeting its predetermined specifications and quality 
 attributes. in the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation therefore, additional process 
 validation data for as and fp has been requested post-approval to confirm the validated status of the 
 process as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation.</p><p>
 the proposed sites for batch control testing are located in the us and the applicant has submitted a plan 
 to transfer fp release testing to a site in eu by july 2022 (latest date for the last test to be transferred). 
 the identified required steps and timelines in the plan are considered appropriate. in view of the public 
 health emergency of international concern declared by the who and in order to ensure early supply of 
 this medicinal product in the context of this emergency, granting of an exemption for batch control testing 
 in a third country is supported, in line with the submitted plan for transfer of testing. annual reports on 
 progress on transfer of testing are requested.</p><p>
 the burgwedel manufacturing site is currently unable to place a unique identifier on the fp. however, the 
 applicant is seeking exemptions from competent authorities of member states that would be willing to 
 accept this product on their market without the unique identifier, in light of the public health emergency. 
 in the absence of any such exemption, the unique identifier is still required, therefore the manufacturer 
 should implement serialisation at the earliest opportunity to allow placing of the product on the market 
 upon expiry of exemptions. 
 although fp lots that comply with the specifications (formulated using within-specification as lots) are 
 expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches, comparability between clinical</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>

 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 material and the commercial product manufactured at the burgwedel site must be demonstrated. this is to justify that the commercial product is representative of the clinical product (and thus that the clinical 
 data and conclusions are also applicable for the commercial product). in the framework of a conditional 
 marketing authorisation, comparability between clinical material and the commercial product will need to 
 be demonstrated post-approval as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation. 
 in the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation therefore, to complete the manufacturing 
 process details, the applicant should fulfil, post-approval, the following specific obligations (sos). 
 so1: the mah should provide additional data to confirm that the active substance (as) process is 
 properly validated. process and batch data from at least 3 representative as batches should be 
 provided. 
 so2: the mah should provide additional data to confirm that the finished product (fp) process is 
 properly validated. process and batch data from at least 3 representative fp batches should be 
 provided. 
 so3: the mah should provide comprehensive comparability data confirming that the commercial 
 product manufactured at the burgwedel site is representative of the material used in the clinical trials. 
 so4: the mah should complete master cell banks (mcb)/working cell bank (wcb) qualification to 
 include also tests for specified viruses. 
 so5: the mah should provide additional qualification data for the critical reagent used in the identity 
 test (quality control release test for as and fp). 
 so6: the mah should develop and introduce an active substance in-process control for total protein 
 with appropriate acceptance criteria.</p><p>
 as regards so1, so2 and so3, the following data is requested to be provided in order to complete the 
 information on the adequate validation of the as process and the fp process and to demonstrate 
 comparability between the commercial product and the clinical material. 
 a) the process validation data for the ppq as batches (burgwedel site) are requested to be provided. 
 these should not be limited to critical quality attributes (cqa) and critical process parameter (cpp) 
 results but should also include results of all process operating conditions mentioned in the tables in 
 section s.2.2. of the dossier. given the issues observed during as ppq2 and as ppq3, two further 
 representative active substance lots (as ppq 4 and 5) will be required to provide sufficient 
 comprehensive evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform 
 effectively and reproducibly to produce the medicinal product, meeting its predetermined 
 specifications and quality attributes. batch data from at least 3 representative and compliant as 
 batches, in total, should be provided and included in section s.4.4 of the ctd. 
 b) the applicant is requested to submit process validation data for the ppq fp batches (burgwedel 
 site). these should not be limited to cqa and cpp results but should also include results of relevant 
 process parameters (e.g. as thaw time, mixing time of final formulated bulk- ffb,…). cqas should 
 also include the fp identity, since the plaque assay (potency) does not provide information about the 
 expression of the gp. as such, a combination of the potency assay (pfu assay) and identity assay (gp 
 immunostaining) is considered necessary to properly assess potency. also results of hold times, 
 time-out-of-refrigeration (tor) and total processing time should be provided. it is expected that limits 
 for these parameters will be challenged in the fp process validation studies. batch data from at least 
 3 representative and compliant fp batches, in total, should be provided and included in section p.5.4 
 of the ctd.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 29/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 c) the applicant is requested to submit comparability analysis data for the burgwedel site demonstrating that as/fp from burgwedel is representative of the as/fp used in the clinical trials. as 
 regards the comparability analysis, the applicant should provide all relevant process/batch data 
 (intermediates, as and fp) from batches produced at idt and at west point. 
 d) as part of the as characterisation and process validation, the applicant is requested to provide 
 results of genome quantitation and aggregate formation (analysed by dynamic light scattering- dls) 
 of the burgwedel as ppq lots. particle size testing by dls should also be performed on 3 as ppq lots 
 and 3 fp ppq lots during stability testing. 
 e) as part of the fp characterisation and process validation, the applicant is expected to perform an 
 identity test (which is considered as part of the potency test) during stability testing on three finished 
 product ppq batches.</p><p>
 f) as part of the fp process validation, to validate the option of using more than 1 as lot for fp 
 formulation, at least one of the fp ppq lots should be formulated from at least 2 as lots. in addition, 
 one fp ppq batch should challenge the maximum batch size. 
 g) because of the heat sensitivity of the active substance, additional process controls should be 
 implemented to sufficiently control the manufacturing process and in particular possible exposure of 
 the vaccine virus to elevated temperatures. therefore, when additional process experience has been 
 gained and additional process data are available, the following should be implemented: 
 (1) the applicant is requested to set a proper and reasonable upper limit for the thawing time of 
 master virus seed (mvs) and working virus seed (wvs), avoiding exposure of the virus to high 
 temperature longer than needed.</p><p>
 (2) to properly control the as process and to limit the time out of refrigerator of the virus to a 
 minimum, it is strongly recommended to implement an upper limit for the total time of as 
 exposed to room temperature during downstream purification (from harvest to freezing of as). 
 furthermore, since virus degradation is known to occur more rapidly at higher temperatures, the 
 company should introduce a separate process parameter for exposure time to 37°c during the 
 benzonase reaction.</p><p>
 h) the applicant states that the active substance opalescence can span from the specification limit to 
 above the highest standard employed in the compendial method. it appears that this wide range is due 
 to the limited manufacturing experience so far. the applicant is requested to adequately tighten the 
 physical assessment limits with increasing numbers of batches produced and tested. the applicant is 
 reminded that specifications are important measures of batch to batch consistency within a defined 
 and acceptable range and that the current specification does not allow for any relevant control of 
 vaccine appearance.</p><p>
 i) a post-thaw stability study (at 25°c) should be performed (to support post-thaw finished product 
 exposure to elevated temperature exposure times) on the fp as described in section p.8.1.2.2. since 
 it will take quite some time before the 36 month time point results from this post-thaw stability study 
 will be available, it is deemed sufficient that for the specific obligation of the cma only the data from 
 the “0” month time point are needed from this post-thaw study. the 36 month results should also be 
 provided (when available), but these data only will not postpone a possible conversion from a cma to 
 a normal ma. so, whereas the “0” month time point data will be required for the so, the 36 m data will 
 be requested in the final report as a recommendation. 
 as regards so4 (
 the mah should complete master cell banks (mcb)/working cell bank (wcb) qualification to include also tests for specified viruses.
 ), the applicant is asked to address the following. whereas the metagenomics analysis is considered a useful tool to screen for other possible viral contaminants,</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 30/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 known/relevant potential viruses should preferentially be screened using more reliable and robust methods that are easier to qualify.</p><p>
 as regards so5 (
 the critical reagent for the identity test (qc release test) should be properly qualified), because of the criticality of the polyclonal antibody (used for identity release test), additional qualification 
 is required. as part of the initial qualification of the polyclonal antibody, to demonstrate the specificity of 
 the polyclonal antibody, the company is expected to include a negative control with vero cells infected 
 with wild type vesicular stomatitis virus: these should also yield a negative result (no immunostaining 
 observed). 
 as regards so6, it is noted that routine testing for host cell protein in as has not been included yet in the 
 ctd. the applicant has proposed to monitor hcp via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration 
 product. upon qualification, this method will be implemented post-approval as an ipc in the relevant 
 sections of the ctd. the applicant is asked to provide data from tests of previously manufactured as ppq 
 lots (as ppq lots 1, 2, 4, and 5). given that benzonase clearance may be indicative for hcp clearance, the 
 applicant’s approach to temporarily release as lots without result for total protein at uf product is 
 acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are within the acceptance limits. however, given the 
 limited experience with the burgwedel process, proper control of hcp (via total protein analysis) is 
 deemed essential and should be implemented as soon as possible as an ipc with acceptance criteria in the 
 relevant sections of module 3 of the ctd. it is also expected that the results of the impurity testing will be 
 mentioned on the release certificates and on the information sent to the omcl. 
 rationale for the specific obligations: so1 and so2: the burgwedel commercial process is identical to the west point clinical lot process (also produced at the same scale). as such, if properly controlled, the process is expected to yield as of the 
 same quality as at the west point site. west point material produced thus far has been shown to be of 
 adequate and consistent quality. burgwedel manufacturing is therefore conditionally accepted on the 
 basis that the technology has been transferred and a gmp certificate has been granted. however, the 
 available process validation data for as and fp do not allow a final conclusion on the validated status of 
 the manufacturing process to be made. the mah is requested to provide additional ppq data to confirm 
 that the as and fp processes are properly validated. process and batch data from 3 representative 
 batches of both as and fp are requested. 
 so3: currently, comparability between clinical material and the commercial product manufactured at the 
 burgwedel site has not been comprehensively demonstrated. although fp lots that comply with the 
 specifications (formulated using within-specification as lots) are expected to behave similarly in terms of 
 potency as the clinical batches, demonstration of comparability is required to justify that the commercial 
 product is representative of the clinical product (and thus that the clinical data and conclusions are also 
 applicable for the commercial product). the as shelf life and fp shelf life (36 months) are based on 
 stability data derived from idt and west point batches (clinical batches). comparability between clinical 
 material and the commercial product must be comprehensively demonstrated. 
 s04: although the applicant has provided reassurance on the viral safety of the cell bank system using a 
 combination of specific tests and metagenomics analysis, additional testing should be performed on the 
 mcb (or wcb) using a robust, reliable and qualified method (e.g. classic pcr). it is currently very difficult 
 (if not impossible) to qualify metagenomics approaches with regard to sensitivity, specificity and limit of 
 detection. therefore, given the potential viral contaminants of vero cells, properly qualified methods are 
 requested and should be implemented to confirm the absence of these viruses from the mcb or wcb 
 (which is in line with current standards and gmp for qualification of cell bank systems). 
 s05: since the potency assay only quantifies the amount of infectious virus without making distinction 
 between the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) and any possible wild type vsv, the identity</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 assay is the only assay which confirms the correct identity of the recombinant vaccine virus. as such, proper qualification of the critical reagents used in this assay is of importance. initial qualification of the 
 polyclonal antibody used in the identity test included as negative controls only uninfected vero cells, 
 damaged vero cells, and mrc-5 cells infected with varicella zoster virus. however, to demonstrate the 
 specificity of the polyclonal antibody, the company is asked to include as part of the initial qualification of 
 the polyclonal antibody also a negative control with vero cells infected with wild type vesicular stomatitis 
 virus: these should also yield a negative result (no immunostaining observed). without this qualification, 
 it cannot be concluded that the release testing panel for as/fp is capable of discriminating between the 
 recombinant vaccine virus and possible wild type vsv.</p><p>
 as regards so6, it is noted that routine testing for host cell protein in as has not been included yet in the 
 ctd. the applicant has proposed to monitor hcp via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration 
 product. upon qualification, this method will be implemented post-approval as an ipc in the relevant 
 sections of the ctd. the applicant has committed to retroactively test previously manufactured as ppq 
 lots (as ppq lots 1, 2, 4, and 5). given that benzonase clearance may be indicative for hcp clearance, the 
 applicant’s approach to temporarily release as lots without result for total protein at uf product is 
 acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are within the acceptance limits. however, given the 
 limited experience with the burgwedel process, proper control of hcp (via total protein analysis) is 
 deemed essential and should be implemented as soon as possible as an ipc with acceptance criteria in the 
 relevant sections of module 3 of the ctd. it is also expected that the results of the impurity testing will be 
 mentioned on the release certificates and on the information sent to the omcl. 
 in conclusion, the quality part of the current dossier may be approved as a conditional ma with a list of 
 specific obligations that need to be fulfilled to complete the manufacturing process details. in addition, 
 the applicant is also requested to take into account the list of recommendations. 
 recommendations the applicant has provided detailed descriptions of the manufacturing process, the control of materials, the process controls (including critical process parameters (cpps)) and the process development, for both 
 the as and the fp. the cell bank system and virus seed system were adequately qualified. to ensure 
 sufficient vaccine supply in the future from the current virus seed system (which only contains a master 
 virus seed), the applicant is recommended to establish a 2-tiered virus seed system by implementing also 
 a working virus seed (wvs). use of the wvs can be submitted post approval via a variation procedure 
 (see section- recommendation(s) for future quality development).</p><p>
 as and fp specifications were provided as well as detailed information on the analytical methods, which 
 were properly validated or qualified. container closure systems for as and fp were described. to confirm 
 the quality and suitability of the finished product containers, the applicant is requested to determine the 
 identity of the two unknown leachables as observed in the leachables studies, and report results when 
 available (see section- recommendation(s) for future quality development).</p><p>
 routine testing of residual benzonase and host cell dna impurities has been included as an in-process 
 control (ipc) with acceptance criteria. as regards host cell protein (hcp), the applicant will monitor hcp 
 via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration (uf) product. upon qualification, this method will 
 be implemented post-approval as an ipc in the relevant sections of the ctd (see list of specific 
 obligations). the applicant will retroactively test previously manufactured as ppq lots (as ppq lots 1, 2, 
 4, and 5). the applicant will also mention ipc results of impurity testing on the release certificates and on 
 the information provided to the official medicines control laboratory (omcl). given that benzonase 
 clearance may be indicative for hcp clearance, the applicant’s approach to temporarily release as lots 
 without result for total protein at uf product is acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are 
 within the acceptance limits.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 host cell protein has been evaluated in clinical idt lots. as the burgwedel site has currently limited experience with the manufacturing process, uf total protein results of batches tested retroactively should 
 be provided when available in order to demonstrate consistency and confirm adequate quality of these 
 batches (see list of recommendations). in addition, the currently proposed acceptance limits for residual 
 benzonase and host cell dna ipc are acceptable for the time being, but when sufficient batch data are 
 available, the applicant should re-evaluate the acceptance limits for impurities (dna, benzonase and 
 hcp). based on the results, revision/tightening of these limits should be considered and proposed in a 
 post-authorisation procedure (see section- recommendation(s) for future quality development).</p><p>
 both the as and the novel excipient recombinant human serum albumin (rhsa) have been characterised 
 in detail. whereas additional testing that was used for characterisation is not required for routine testing, 
 it is important that these methods remain available as characterisation tests to be used in the future in 
 case of relevant changes/variations (for comparability analyses). in particular, for as, the tests for 
 residual impurities (benzonase, hcp, tryple activity, etc.) should be maintained, whereas for the rhsa 
 excipient the tests for aggregates (sec-hplc), water content and host-cell protein (hcp) should be kept 
 as characterisation tests (see section- recommendation(s) for future quality development).</p><p>
 although suitable information about the rhsa excipient has been provided, which is considered an 
 important component of the final finished product, the applicant is requested to provide supplemental 
 validation data for accuracy, linearity and range for both the tris and rhsa assays (for qc testing of 
 excipient) (see section- recommendation(s) for future quality development).</p></section><section><header n="2.2.5">2.2.5.

 comparability data; impurity testing; completion of viral safety testing of the mcb and wcb and additional 
 qualification of a reagent used in the identity assay. the gmp / mia for the as/fp site was subsequently 
 granted and this mo was therefore resolved. data have been submitted by the company during the

 of a conditional marketing authorisation on quality grounds taking into account the public health 
 emergency of international concern declared by who. in conclusion, the quality part of the current

 data that, besides nhp, also concern rodents.</p><p>
 in studies conducted at usamriid and msd, intramuscular administration of v920 vaccine was well 
 tolerated and highly immunogenic in cynomolgus macaques across a wide dose range (3×10
 1 to 1×108 pfu). these studies support immunogenicity of the vaccine, with zebov-gp-specific igg detectable in most animals 14 days after a single immunization with all animals seroconverting within 28 days. 
 protective efficacy against evd was demonstrated, with 95 to 100% protection against mortality following 
 a lethal intramuscular zebov challenge 42 days after immunization. 
 previously published studies demonstrated that a single immunization with v920 is highly immunogenic 
 and effective in protection against disease and death by the lethal im zebov challenge in the nhp animal 
 model. notably, complete protection in nhp was observed as early as 7 days after a single vaccination, 
 and partial protection at 3 days post vaccination, demonstrating a rapidly acquired protective immunity, 
 which is of interest in the context of the use of v920 in outbreak settings.</p><p>
 current nhp challenge models are more stringent than evd in humans: a challenge dose of 1,000 pfu 
 results in 100% lethality in unvaccinated cynomolgus macaques, and is generally thought to represent 
 100 to 1,000-fold lethal dose. in these conditions, and with survival as the most important endpoint, it 
 can be concluded that v920 has shown to be protective in this model. 
 however, the high vaccine efficacy has hampered the identification of a potential correlate of protection. 
 the aim of the studies to identify immune parameters that correlate with protection was not reached. on 
 the other hand, many of the data of the planned assessment of the immune response were not available 
 at the start of the procedure. these include the assessment of binding and neutralizing antibody titres in 
 the qualified elisa and prnt60 assays but also experimental parameters such as t and b cell elispots, 
 ics, adcc assay, fc effector function assay etc. in addition, immune responses were sometimes only 
 assessed for a selection of animals. in this regard, the currently ongoing efforts to obtain these data are 
 strongly supported and are expected to provide some new insight into the immune correlate of protection. 
 during review of the maa, 3 study reports were submitted on the assessment of binding and neutralizing 
 antibody titres in the qualified elisa and prnt assays. the applicant clarified that the experimental 
 parameters as identified above are no longer seen as a priority. focus is currently on the assessment of 
 fc effector functions. in addition, outcomes other than survival will also be evaluated (viremia, clinical 
 signs). submission of these upcoming data for review is considered important in the post-authorisation 
 phase.</p><p> 
 the important role of humoral immune response in protection has been substantiated by depletion 
 studies in nhp as described in the literature. it has been demonstrated that absence of antibodies (due to 
 depletion of cd4 t cells at the time of vaccination) leads to death after challenge, whereas animals 
 survive when cd4 t cells are depleted at the time of challenge, as do animals depleted of cd8 cells at the 
 time of vaccination. altogether these data show the importance of a humoral immune response upon 
 vaccination. cd4 t cells also play an important role in protection, as indicated by depletion assays as well 
 as outcome of shiv infected animals, but rather to provide help to b cells than via cd4 t cell effector 
 functions. still, confirmatory data with respect to the exact role of t-cell immunity vs. antibodies are 
 missing.</p><p> 
 assessment of endpoints other than mortality could provide additional information from the performed 
 studies. so far, these studies indicate that no sterile immunity is obtained by vaccination. indeed, a 
 number of vaccinated animals that survived had detectable viremia after challenge, and some also had</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 38/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 clinical signs indicative of infection (although no histologic lesions of ebola viral infection were observed). viremia after challenge was higher in the durability study (pd004), as compared to previous challenge 
 studies performed by usamriid, and animal source (mauritian versus cambodian) or external factors like 
 stress related to long transportation may have influenced this parameter. viremia could be an interesting 
 parameter as alternative to survival for assessment of correlates of protection. the applicant will further 
 evaluate long term protection in an ongoing and planned durability study to be submitted 
 post-authorisation. 
 to date, the exact duration of protection after a single dose of v920 is not fully understood. in the 
 durability study in nhp (pd004), robust antibody titres but only partial protection against im challenge 
 were observed at three months (33% survival) and 1 year (43% survival) after a single vaccination. 
 some caveats in this study make it difficult to determine the meaning of these data, including the 
 different origin of the cynomolgus macaques compared to previous nhp studies (mauritian versus 
 cambodian origin) and that the animals underwent long-distance transportation one week prior to 
 challenge. also for this study immunogenicity assessment with validated assays and additional immune 
 parameters is ongoing. overall, data on duration of protection are considered limited at this time, as 
 corresponding human data are not available either.</p><p>
 in any case, the fact that protection long term is reduced despite the presence of circulating antibodies 
 raises concerns on what could be the best biomarker for determining long term protection. the adequacy 
 of the current stringent nhp model for long term protection may deserve discussion as well.</p></section><section><header>safety pharmacology programme</header><p>no stand-alone safety pharmacology study has been conducted, in the light of results of the nonclinical general toxicity studies and clinical safety, as per the applicable regulatory guidelines.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.3">2.3.3.

 the v920 vaccine virus showed approximately 33% slower growth kinetics than wild-type vsv in vero cell

 design including species selection, number of doses, dose, assessment of recovery was in line with 
 relevant guidelines and is considered acceptable.</p></section><section><header>genotoxicity and carcinogenicity</header><p>the absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable based on current guidelines and given the type of product and its posology.</p></section><section><header>reproduction toxicity</header><p>the developmental and reproductive toxicology study in sprague dawley rats was designed taking into account the recommendations of the who guidelines on nonclinical evaluations of vaccines, regarding 
 pre-mating treatment to ensure exposure and induction of immune response leading to antibody transfer 
 (5.28 x 10
 7 pfu, given 28 and 7 days prior to cohabitation, on gestation day 6 and on lactation day 7), and a second group to evaluate viremia (single dose of 5.28 x 10
 7 pfu</p><p>on gd6), a dose comparable to a full human dose, same route of administration as intended for human use, evaluated endpoints and division 
 in subgroups (caesarean / postnatal follow-up). although the classical way for calculation of safety 
 margins may not be that relevant for a live vaccine, large body weight based safety margins, together 
 with observed immune response and viremia in the immunogenicity and viremia group respectively, 
 support the applicant’s conclusion that vaccination before and during gestation is well tolerated under the 
 conditions of this study, with no effect on mating or pre- and post-natal development and no teratogenic 
 potential. when v920 was administered to female rats, antibodies against zebov gp were detected in 
 foetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition of 
 maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively.</p></section><section><header>toxicokinetic data</header><p>v920 is a live attenuated vaccine and as such, its distribution, persistence and shedding were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys after im administration. the biodistribution study showed persistence of v920 
 viral rna (by qrt-pcr) in lymphoid tissues but no evidence for persistence of infectious virus (by plaque 
 assay). viral rna after day 7 was generally confined to tissues lacking potential for shedding in excretions 
 or secretions and showed no evidence of distribution to the brain or spinal cord at any time point. it should 
 be noted that in clinical trials, positive saliva samples were detected and in repeat dose toxicity studies, 
 urine samples were positive for some animals (mice and nhp). dissemination to the environment or 
 transmission from vaccinees to close contacts can therefore not be excluded. as samples were only 
 assessed for presence of infectious virus vaccine at limited timepoints, it is not known how long the 
 infectious virus was present for. at day one, several samples were positive and at day 56, all were 
 negative but no intermediate timepoints were assessed. the applicant hypothesized that the vaccine rna 
 detected in lymphoid tissues beyond d56 results from viral genomic rna within macrophages trafficked to

 together with the results of the biodistribution study described above showing absence of vaccine genetic 
 material in cns tissues, show that there is no tropism for the cns, and even if the vaccine virus is 
 introduced intrathalamically in the cns of nhp, no neurological symptoms are observed. hence, these 
 data support the use of the vaccine in the proposed indication and population.</p><p>
 rd-rhsa is a novel excipient, and should, as such, be subject to a specific safety assessment, and 
 toxicology and pk should be investigated. the applicant provided a justification as to why additional 
 nonclinical studies are not needed. rice-derived recombinant and plasma-derived hsa are identical, and 
 considering pd-hsa is a qualified excipient, the only potential safety concern consists in the fact that rice 
 host cell proteins might theoretically induce a risk of allergic reactions. however additional nonclinical 
 studies would not be able to fully exclude this theoretical risk. therefore, it is agreed that no additional 
 nonclinical studies are warranted to validate the excipient in the proposed formulation and use.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.5">2.3.5.  
 ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>v920 is a live attenuated vaccine carrying a single-stranded negative sense rna genome. the vaccine consists of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) in which the gene encoding the vsv 
 glycoprotein g has been replaced with the zaire ebola virus (zebov) glycoprotein (gp).</p><p> 
 data collected from clinical trials with v920 show that viremia (measured by the detection of 
 rvsvδg-zebov-gp rna in the blood) was common among vaccine recipients, with a maximum viremia 
 value observed of 2.9x10
 4 copies/ml. viremia resolved in most subjects by 1 week (see also section 2.6 page 106). shedding of the v920 virus (measured by the detection of rvsvδg-zebov-gp rna in saliva, 
 urine, and fluid from skin vesicles) was rare in adults. adolescents and children presented a higher 
 magnitude of vaccine viremia and a greater degree of vaccine viral shedding in the saliva and urine 
 compared to adults (maximum shedding observed was 7x10
 4 copies/ml in adolescent saliva).</p><p>person-to-person transmission of the v920 virus has not been documented. because shedding data 
 indicate the presence of v920 in bodily fluids and in vesicular lesions and because the cell tropism of 
 rvsvδg-zebov-gp show features consistent with both vsv and zebov, the dissemination of v920 in 
 human population by vaccinees cannot be ruled out. v920 seems generally well tolerated though 
 systemic and local adverse effects have been reported, with amongst others the possibility for vesicular 
 rash or cutaneous vasculitis following vaccination by means of which exposure to v920 is possible. very 
 limited information is available on the safety of v920 in vulnerable populations such as immune 
 compromised, pregnant or lactating women or children below 1 year of age.</p><p>
 because this vaccine is based on vsv, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk 
 assessment included species that are relevant for the wild type vsv backbone of this vaccine. virulence 
 or replication of v920 has been investigated in rodents, pigs, swine, arthropods and non-human primates. 
 in pigs, viremia and clinical signs consistent with wt-vsv were observed, albeit with delayed appearance 
 compared to the wild-type vsv infection. no transmission to control animals was detected. the possibility 
 of recombination events between the vaccine vector and wt-vsv was evaluated and is considered very 
 low.</p><p>
 upon request, the applicant provided additional information for vaccine recipients and medical centre to 
 ensure optimal and effective implementation of the proposed risk management measures. as a 
 precaution, vaccinees should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids for at least 
 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical risk of spread of the v920 vaccine virus. people who 
 develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. cover the</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 vaccination site with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle fluid. the bandage may be removed when 
 there is no visible fluid leakage. to avoid unintended exposure to livestock, ensure medical waste and 
 other cleaning materials do not come in contact with livestock.</p><p>
 based on limited shedding in adults, the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of 
 horizontal transmission in pigs, the overall risk of ervebo to human health and the environment is 
 considered negligible.</p><p>
 in any case, any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional 
 guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.6">2.3.6.  
 discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>the results from pharmacology studies conducted with v920 by usamriid and msd, and supported by literature data, demonstrate immunogenicity of the vaccine and protective efficacy against evd following 
 intramuscular zebov challenge 42 days after immunization. still less well understood is how long the 
 protection conferred by a single im dose of v920 can last and what the specific mechanism for protection 
 would be. no major objections were identified, and no additional studies are required. overall, antibody 
 responses upon vaccination are robust but it is not possible that a threshold of antibody titre predicting 
 survival or time of death can be identified at the present time. this conclusion is supported by the final 
 analysis of the immunogenicity data from study pd001, pd002, pd003 and pd004, as the missing 
 long-term immunogenicity data on animals that were vaccinated but not selected for challenge were 
 submitted during the procedure (pd003-pd004). immune correlates of protection will be further 
 explored, including assessment of antibody titre correlates to outcomes other than survival, such as ebov 
 titre and clinical score post challenge, and time to death in the durability study where survival was much 
 less than 100%. these results will be provided post-authorisation. 
 besides efforts to explore correlation of available immune response parameters, elisa and prnt titres, to 
 outcomes other than survival, data will also be generated on other antibody features than titre and 
 neutralisation, including fc effector function, isotype and antibody specificity. these data will be explored 
 in the durability study, pd004, which is appropriate as some vaccinated animals succumbed in this study 
 and other parameters (viremia after challenge, clinical score, time to death) can be assessed as well. 
 depending on the outcome of this analysis, it will be considered if conducting similar analysis for the other 
 studies is relevant. the assessment of those parameters that are identified in the protocols as 
 experimental parameters, including t and b cell elispots, ics, and adcc assay have not been done, and 
 are not planned in the near future. this can be considered acceptable in view of ongoing efforts to explore 
 other immune correlates as indicated above. 
 durability data are considered limited, as human durability data are not available either. further 
 assessment of the immune response in the durability study is ongoing, and to better interpret the data 
 regarding duration of protection, submission for review of these data post-authorisation is considered 
 important. in addition, following this 1-year durability study and the difficulties encountered for 
 interpretation of the data, the applicant is in the process of generating more durability data in an ongoing 
 (4 month) and planned (1 year) durability study. current data show however reduced protection.</p><p>
 pharmacokinetic studies are normally not required for a vaccine. the applicant provides a distribution, 
 persistence and shedding study in monkeys but no other toxicokinetics studies were performed with v920 
 vaccine, which is acceptable. 
 all pivotal toxicology studies have been conducted according to glp requirements and the relevant ema 
 and who guidelines. safety has been assessed in repeat dose toxicity studies in mice and non-human 
 primates, in a reproductive and developmental toxicity study in rats, and an exploratory neurovirulence</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 study in non-human primates.</p><p>overall the pivotal toxicity studies have adequate design and conduct, and results do not raise any safety signal of concern.</p><p>
 in addition, the neurovirulence study with v920 was non-glp, which was undesirable. however, at this 
 stage, this is a non-issue because the clinical safety database gathered to date does not show signals of 
 major safety concern, and a glp-compliant biodistribution study in nhp did not show evidence of v920 
 distribution to the brain. accordingly, re-testing of neurovirulence for v920 under the glp conditions is 
 deemed unnecessary.</p><p> 
 the gmo era concludes that the overall risk linked to the intended use of v920 for both humans and the 
 environment is considered negligible.</p><p>
 overall, the nonclinical safety data demonstrate that v920 has an acceptable safety profile.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.7">2.3.7.  
 conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>collectively, the results from pharmacology studies conducted with v920 by usamriid and msd, and supported by literature data, demonstrate protection after challenge and induction of a robust immune 
 response. also considering the clinical data indicative of vaccine efficacy, the provided nonclinical 
 pharmacology data are considered sufficient to support the use of v920 in individuals at high risk of 
 exposure in the short term, e.g. in an outbreak setting.</p><p>
 data originated from distribution, persistence and shedding studies in monkeys showed no major 
 concerns.</p><p>
 the toxicity profile of v920 has been thoroughly evaluated and the nonclinical data support the acceptable 
 safety profile of v920 as a vaccine that could be used for active immunization of at-risk individuals to 
 protect against ebola virus disease (evd) caused by zaire ebola virus.

 pharmacokinetics</header><p>no clinical pharmacology studies describing the pharmacokinetic properties of v920 were conducted in support of this application. this is acceptable because pharmacokinetic studies are generally not required 
 for vaccines because the kinetic properties of antigens do not provide useful information for determining 
 dose recommendations according to the “note for guidance on the clinical evaluation of vaccines” 
 chmp/vwp/164653/2005.</p><p>
 the main characteristics of the 
 in vivo behaviour of the live v920 vaccine virus have been evaluated through assessment of vaccine viremia and shedding. vaccine viremia (defined as the presence of vaccine 
 viruses in the blood stream) and shedding were investigated as a safety parameter, but also as a measure 
 of the bioavailability and replicative ability of the vaccine virus. virus shedding was determined by the 
 presence of the vaccine viruses in secretion or excretion products, and it was assessed in urine and saliva 
 (phase i trials) but also in liquid of vesicles and in synovial fluids (phase ii and iii studies).</p><p>
 viremia and shedding were measured using a rt-pcr assay in the 8 phase i studies at different time 
 points (from day 1 to day 84 depending on the study) and occasionally in the phase 2/3 studies.</p></section><section><header>vaccine viremia</header><p>vaccine viremia was evaluated in 771 adult subjects vaccinated with v920 dose levels ranging from 3x103 to 1x108 pfu. 186 adult subjects were vaccinated with the selected dose of 2x107 pfu (n=110) or higher (n=76).</p><p>v920 vaccine virus was detectable in the plasma of most adult subjects vaccinated with vaccine doses ≥ 
 1x10
 5 pfu and mainly from day 1 to day 7. at the following time point, by day 14, viremia was no longer detected except for one subject (although it was not tested for all subjects).</p><p>
 school-age children and adolescents vaccinated with the dose level of 2x10
 7 pfu were viremic from day 1 to day 7 and copy numbers/ml were in the same range as those of adults. vaccine viremia has not been 
 investigated more than 7 days post-vaccination in this paediatric population.</p></section><section><header>viral shedding</header><p>shedding was detected by pcr in urine or saliva in 23 adult subjects out of 299 vaccinated subjects who had samples collected and tested. shedding in urine was observed from day 1 through day 7. shedding 
 in saliva was observed from day 1 through day 14 after any dose level. 
 vaccine virus was also detected in skin vesicles of 4 adult subjects out of 10 subjects tested in the 
 v920-005 trial. virus rna was detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days postvaccination in one of the four 
 subjects.</p><p>
 virus shedding was detected in a higher proportion of school-age children and adolescents (28/39) 
 (v920-007 study) compared to adults. at day 7, v920 rna was detectable in saliva in 35% of school-age 
 children and in 88% of adolescents, and in a urine sample from 1 school-age child.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 been detected in other biological fluids than urine and saliva such as the semen, vaginal fluids, aqueous 
 humour, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid and placenta, v920 virus might also be present in such 
 fluids although it is unknown for which duration.</p><p>
 no infectious assays were performed to distinguish between circulating or shed virus and infectious 
 particles. therefore, it remains difficult to clearly define the risk associated to viremia and shedding. 
 the kinetics of viral clearance also remains uncertain. it is however unlikely that live viruses persist in the 
 blood or bodily fluids of a vaccinated adult more than 28 days post-vaccination. 
 based on the results discussed there is a theoretical risk of transmission of v920 from human-to-human 
 and a potential related safety issue, particularly for high-risk individuals.</p><p>
 the risk of transmission to high-risk individuals is addressed in the section 4.4 of the smpc. vaccine 
 recipients should avoid close association with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily 
 fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. blood donation should be avoided for at least 6 weeks 
 post-vaccination. individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the 
 vesicles until they heal to minimize the risk of possible transmission of the vaccine virus through open 
 vesicles. the theoretical possible transmission of v920 to livestock is also mentioned in section 4.4 for this 
 reason. 
 as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of ervebo during pregnancy. the benefit of 
 breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of vaccination for the mother should be balanced. 
 a warning that the ‘use of other ebola control measures’ should not be interrupted after vaccination was 
 included in the section 4.4 of the smpc as well as ‘standard precautions when caring for patients with 
 known or suspected ebola disease’. warnings and precautions on how to protect themselves and how to 
 avoid spread of germs were also implemented in the pl.</p><p> 
 vaccine viremia and shedding were more pronounced in school-age children and adolescents. the 
 duration of viremia and shedding in children and adolescent is not known. no data on viremia and 
 shedding were presented for hiv-seropositive subjects, pregnant woman or elderly subjects (&gt;65 yoa). 
 viral shedding will be further characterized in ongoing v920-015 achiv and v920-016 prevac studies, 
 respectively investigating hiv-infected adults and adolescent and healthy adults and children.</p><p>
 finally, since the release specifications are based on the vaccine lots used in the clinical trials, the 
 commercial lots are expected to have similar viremia and shedding.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.3">2.4.3.

 described in this section. 
 the clinical development program of v920 consists of 12 clinical trials with immunogenicity data available 
 for 11 of them. no immunogenicity data are available for the efficacy part of the pivotal v920-010 trial.</p><p>a 
 total of 15,997 adult subjects were vaccinated with v920 in these clinical trials; 15,399 of these subjects 
 received 2 
 × 107 plaque forming units (pfu)/dose or higher of v920. the trials also included approximately 536 adults ≥65 years of age, 234 children 6 to 17 years of age, 278 women who were 
 incidentally found to be pregnant during the clinical trials, and 22 hiv-positive individuals (in the 
 v920-009 trial only).</p></section><section><header>assays used to evaluate immunogenicity</header><p>immune responses to v920 were evaluated by 2 types of assays in the program, gp-elisa and virus neutralization assays (pseudovirion neutralization assay [psvna] and plaque reduction neutralization 
 test [prnt]).</p><p>
 the gp-elisa measures total igg binding antibodies against the ebola gp. it is an indirect elisa which 
 utilizes a purified recombinant gp as the coating antigen and an enzyme-conjugated anti-human igg 
 secondary antibody as the reporter or signal system. testing was conducted at different laboratories 
 during development. the psvna and prnt detect the virus neutralizing antibody levels from human sera 
 following the administration of the v920 vaccine. 
 in the 8 phase 1 trials, non-validated gp-elisa, psvna, and prnt assays were utilized to assess 
 immunogenicity. testing was done in different laboratories. validated gp-elisa (fang human zebov-gp 
 elisa) and prnt results were presented for the phase 2 and 3 studies v920-009, v920-011, and 
 v920-012. virus neutralization was measured by psvna in 7 of the phase 1 trials; the exception was 
 v920-004, in which, virus neutralization was measured by prnt. the validation reports for the gp-elisa 
 assay and prnt were approved by the fda in february 2017. validation protocol and reports, including 
 the performance of the elisa, particularly in term of reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity, were 
 evaluated and deemed acceptable. to enhance the analysis, a serostatus cut-off (ssco) is applied which 
 is endorsed (see also below).</p><p>
 elisa titres were expressed in units/ml, endpoint titres or ec90 in the initial phase 1 studies; 
 subsequently the zebov-gp elisa titres expressed in elisa units (eu)/ml were further defined as the 
 primary immunologic endpoint for the v920 program. the lower limit of quantification (lloq) was 58.84.</p><p>
 the immunogenicity analyses included the assessment of the geometric mean titre (gmt), geometric 
 mean fold rise (gmfr), and seroresponse in the gp-elisa and the prnt assays. seroresponse definitions 
 were different for the phase 1 studies compared to the phase 2 and 3 studies because the cut-off of 
 seropositivity and the seroresponse criteria were determined after having obtained the immunogenicity 
 results of the phase 1 and the prevail studies. the rationale for the choice of the selected serostatus 
 cut-off of 200 eu/ml was to decrease the proportion of pre-vaccination positive subjects compared to the 
 use of the assay lloq in a non-endemic population. the choice of the cut-off is endorsed. an assessment 
 of immunogenicity based on the baseline ab status is being conducted and the applicant will provide the 
 data and the results of the immunogenicity evaluation post-authorisation. 
 similarly, seroconversion/seroresponse criteria were arbitrarily defined. seroconversion was defined as a 
 post-vaccination elisa titre ≥200 eu/ml that was also at least a 4-fold increase in zebov igg compared 
 with baseline (phase 1, primary endpoint and phase 2/3, secondary endpoint) and seroresponse was</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 defined as a post-vaccination elisa titre ≥ 200 eu/ml that was also at least a 2-fold increase in zebov igg compared with baseline (phase 2/3, primary endpoint). results were described in term of 
 seroconversion rate (scr), proportion of subjects meeting seroresponse criteria at specific timepoints, 
 and geometric mean concentration (gmt). 
 the psvna and prnt are both neutralization assays to determine the virus neutralizing antibody levels 
 from human sera after vaccination. however, psvna differs from the prnt in that the 
 in vitro pseudovirion can infect cells but cannot replicate. the psvna was replaced by the prnt assay in the phase 2 and 3 studies because of lack of validation due to technical limitations including variability of reagents. 
 as mentioned above, the prnt assay was further qualified and validated before its use in the phase 2 and 
 3 studies. the prnt validation results confirm the performance characteristics of the prnt assay and 
 demonstrate that the assay is suitable for its intended use.</p><p>
 prnt based on 60% reduction in viral plaque was selected to measure ab neutralization capacities. data 
 indicating whether ab detected as neutralizing v920 are able to neutralize wt ebov became available 
 during the procedure (a panel of 7 samples from nibsc has been tested at focus diagnostics and the ab 
 titres generated in the rvsvδg-zebov-gp-based prnt were compared with a wild-type neutralization 
 assay). results support the fact that ab detected as neutralizing v920 are able to neutralize wt ebov 
 in vitro
 .</p><p>the clinical relevance of the prnt assay is not known; considerations should be given as to whether virus 
 neutralizing activity detected in an 
 in vitro assay is predictive of ebov neutralizing activity in vivo. to help further clarifying the clinical relevance of the immune response, the applicant will provide analyses of 
 immune correlates of protection post-authorisation. 
 characterization of adaptive cellular response to vaccine antigen or peptides (b- and t-cell responses) 
 was planned to be explored in various phase 1 trials (v920 -001, -002, -003, -005, -006, -007) using 
 various techniques such as elispot, flow cytometry or mass spectrometry. vaccine-induced innate 
 responses were also planned to be investigated. the results of the exploratory assays are not essential for 
 defining the benefit/risk of v920 and thus it is acceptable that they will be provided by the applicant as 
 soon as available in the post-authorisation phase. 
 some limited preliminary data on cross reacting binding or neutralizing antibody responses against 
 related haemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g. sudan ebolavirus) were presented by the applicant; however, no 
 conclusion could be drawn.</p></section><section><header>gamma irradiation</header><p>the blood samples collected in the v920-009 and v920-011 trials (conducted in west africa in the context of an ongoing ebola outbreak) were gamma irradiated at the target dose of 50 kilograys (kgy) to 
 inactivate ebola virus, if present. after irradiation, these samples were tested in the validated gp-elisa 
 and prnt. the blood samples collected in the v920-012 trial were not gamma-irradiated prior to testing 
 in the validated assays because there was no risk that the specimens contained ebola virus as the trial 
 was conducted outside of the outbreak setting.</p><p>
 a gamma irradiation study was performed utilizing 60 samples from the american phase i trial (protocol 
 v920-004) and various control samples, which spanned the dynamic range of both the validated elisa 
 and qualified prnt. in this study, gamma irradiation has been demonstrated to result in an approximate 
 20% elevation in measured antibody response for negative clinical samples. conversely, gamma 
 irradiation resulted in an approximate 20% reduction in post vaccination antibody response (1.21-fold 
 decrease with 95% [ci = 1.15, 1.27-fold]) in the gp-elisa. reference standard (rs) and quality controls 
 (qc) were not gamma irradiated. the effect of gamma irradiation was not consistently observed for the 
 prnt.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 as consequence of the elevation in day 0 and reduction in day 56 concentration, the fold-change in response to vaccination (day 56/day 0) for the gamma irradiated samples as compared to the 
 non-gamma irradiated samples correspond to a 42% reduction on average in the elisa, meaning that the 
 percentage of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in response to vaccination could be reduced. 
 gamma-irradiation was only one of the factors that influenced the choice of seroresponse criteria. as 
 mentioned previously, the choice of the seroresponse criteria was mainly based on the liberian prevail 
 study as representative of the target population. 
 a potential explanation for the effects of gamma irradiation is that irradiation partially denatures 
 antibodies, causing nonspecific binding pre-vaccination in the gp-elisa as well as decreased specific 
 binding in the gp elisa post-vaccination. gamma irradiation was applied to the specimens from 
 v920-009 and v920-011 clinical trials where lower gmts for all time points have been observed.</p></section><section><header>dose-response studies</header><p>eight phase i trials (v920-001 to v920-008) were conducted in the us and canada, europe (switzerland and germany), and regions of africa not affected by the outbreak (gabon and kenya, v920-007 and 
 v920-008) to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the v920 vaccine and to establish the final dose.</p><p>
 the phase i dose finding program included 795 adult subjects who received v920 as a single dose ranging 
 from 3×10
 3 pfu/dose to 1×108 pfu/dose. the phase i trials included 197 adult subjects who received a single dose of 2×10
 7 pfu or higher of v920. the dose level of 2x107 pfu was evaluated in 40 children and adolescents (v920-007). overall, 135 subjects received placebo in the phase i blinded trials. all the trials 
 administered a single im dose of v920, except the v920-002 trial in which 2 doses were administered 
 (prime-boost regimen). immunogenicity was assessed at different time points (from day 0 up to day 
 365). not all time points were evaluated in all phase i trials. non-validated elisa, psvna or prnt were 
 used to assess the immunogenicity of v920.</p><p>
 gmts, gmfrs and seroconversion rates (scrs) were evaluated. in all phase i trials, for elisa antibody 
 titres the seroconversion was defined as a post-vaccination elisa titre ≥200 eu/ml that was also at least 
 a 4-fold increase in zebov igg compared to baseline.</p><p>
 the results of the phase i trials allowed to assess the anti-gp antibody kinetics after vaccination. gmts, 
 gmfr, and scrs were higher at all time points in the vaccine groups compared with the placebo groups, 
 were no response was observed. no immune response was observed for any dose group on day 7 
 (ebov-naïve subjects, studies v920-001 to v920-004). antibody titres increased from day 7 and were 
 measurable to a different extent in all dosing groups on day 14.</p><p>
 a dose response was observed with higher gmts, gmfrs, and scrs in the higher dose groups at the 
 earlier time points (i.e. on day 14 and to a less extent on day 28) vs. later time points because antibody 
 titres in the high dose groups (2x10
 7 pfu and 1x108 pfu) tended to peak on day 28 and plateaued afterwards with a slight to moderate decrease from day 180 to day 360; instead in the lower dosing 
 groups titres tended to continuously increase from day 28 to 180/360.</p><p>
 though no correlate of protection is currently known for the v920 vaccine, and immunogenicity cannot 
 directly be related to efficacy, the notably higher immune response at early time points favours the higher 
 doses for a vaccine intended for emergency use in an outbreak situation. between the doses 2x10
 7 and 1x10
 8 no notably difference in immune response could be observed (and confirmed in study v920-012). as long as a correlate of protection or a threshold is unknown, gmts are considered a more robust value 
 than seroconversion rates with an arbitrary threshold of 200 eu/ml. the phase i immunogenicity data do 
 overall indicate an immune response sustainable through day 360.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 neutralizing antibodies measured by prnt at baseline, day 28/month 1, day 180/month 6, and months 9 
 to 12/month 12 post-vaccination. immunogenicity was also assessed at month 24 post-vaccination in the 
 v920-012 trial. 
 for the v920-009, v920-011, and v920-012 trials, the immunogenicity analyses included assessment of 
 the gmt, gmfr, and seroresponse in the gp-elisa and the prnt assays. in all phase 2 trials, for elisa 
 antibody titres, seroresponse was defined as a post-vaccination elisa titre ≥200 eu/ml that was also at 
 least a 2-fold increase in zebov igg compared with baseline (primary endpoint), or at least a 4-fold 
 increase (secondary endpoint).</p></section><section><header>v920-009 (prevail)</header><p>the v920-009 “prevail” trial was originally designed as a phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trial of 2 leading ebola vaccine candidates (v920, provided by msd, 
 and chad3-ebo z, provided by glaxosmithkline) in adults 18 years of age or older in liberia. due to low 
 evd incidence, the v920-009 protocol was amended to enlarge the immunogenicity portion of the 
 sub-study and to cancel the phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial. the initial target of recruiting 600 adults 
 to the phase 2 immunogenicity part of the trial was achieved in march 2015 and subsequently expanded 
 to recruit a total of 1500 subjects with follow-up for 12 months in order to obtain more safety and 
 immunogenicity data. group a [n=500] received chad3-ebo z, group b [n=500] received v920, and 
 group c [n=500] placebo. even though the efficacy part of the study was cancelled, the protocol was 
 further amended to include a ring vaccination strategy following three new evd cases observed in 
 november 2015 near monrovia (liberia), and to extend safety and immunogenicity follow-up to 2 or 3 
 years post-vaccination. ring vaccination data were collected and published (gschell 2017, bolay 2019), 
 and reportedly do not add important safety information to the database. since v920-009 is a supportive 
 phase 2 trial, the limited number of vaccinated subjects (n=444), the absence of identification of sae 
 through a passive follow-up and the obtention of immunogenicity data with a non-validated assay, these 
 data are not considered critical for the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy assessment.</p><p> 
 study population and design 
 a total of 500 subjects were randomized and received v920. a majority of subjects were male (62.6%), 
 and all subjects were black or african. the median age was 29.0 years (range: 18 to 75 years). 
 twenty-two subjects (4.4%) who received v920 were hiv-positive based on hiv antibody testing at the 
 vaccination visit. however, the serum taken for hiv testing at the vaccination visit was only tested after 
 the vaccination was completed for the v920-009 trial. therefore, no criteria for cd4 count or 
 antiretroviral therapy could be applied for patients’ selection. additional data is expected from on ongoing 
 trial in hiv-positive subjects (v920-015). 
 the trial design is acceptable, allowing to assess immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity compared to 
 saline placebo (0.9% nacl). as there was no known licensed vaccine to prevent evd, the placebo group 
 was also acceptable.</p><p>
 immunogenicity analysis population 
 the fas population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity and included 477 
 subjects who had complete specimen sets available for immunogenicity testing in the validated gp-elisa 
 and prnt through month 12 post-vaccination. some subjects were excluded from the analysis due to 
 unevaluable serology sample or a missing assay result (for gp-elisa, n=13 and for prnt, n=49).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 immunogenicity analyses were not conducted for the pp population since only 1 protocol deviation was identified. 
 immunogenicity results 
 the v920-009 report presented immunogenicity data for the vaccine group but not for the placebo group, 
 as only the samples of the vaccine group were analysed with the validated assays, whereas the placebo 
 samples were analysed earlier with the non-validated assays. the immunogenicity data of the placebo 
 group were referenced through a publication (kennedy et al. nejm 2015). the number of subjects 
 included in the placebo group decreased from 471 at week 1, to 468 at month 1, to 458 at months 6 and 
 12. 
 ninety-seven (20.9%) of 464 subjects tested had a baseline gp-elisa ≥200 eu/ml. gp-elisa gmts for 
 the v920 overall fas population were higher than baseline at month 1, month 6, and month 12, with a 
 peak occurring at month 1. gmts constantly declined from 994.7 eu/ml [95% ci 915.0, 1,081.3] at 
 month 1 to 661.4 eu/ml [95% ci 613.2, 713.4] at month 12. gmts were higher at baseline for males 
 (140.8 eu/ml [95% ci 127.2, 156.0]) compared with females (87.6 eu/ml [95% ci 75.1, 102.2]), but 
 tended to be higher at all post vaccination time points for females (1,112.6 eu/ml [95% ci 964.9, 
 1,282.9], 871.3 eu/ml [95% ci 756.7, 1,003.3], 818.2 eu/ml [95% ci 710.3, 942.6]) compared with 
 males (930.6 eu/ml [95% ci 839.8, 1,031.3], 631.7 eu/ml [ 95% ci 578.6, 689.5], 582.2 eu/ml [95%

 of conduct. after the trial was launched at multiple vaccination clinics, an immunogenicity sub-study of approximately 500 participants was added to the protocol as amendment 3 (27 april 2015) and initiated. 
 immunogenicity analyses were performed pre vaccination and at months 1, 6, and 9-12. 
 study population and design 
 the study population included adults 18 years of age and older who were at high risk of exposure to ebola 
 infection through their work in the study districts. this included 1) personnel working in healthcare 
 facilities where care was provided for ebola patients; 2) personnel working in non-ebola healthcare 
 facilities who may have been exposed to undiagnosed ebola-infected individuals; and 3) personnel 
 working in one of the following front-line job categories: surveillance team, ambulance team, burial 
 workers, or workers responsible for swabbing deceased persons. subjects with hiv were excluded from 
 the trial. 
 a total of 528 subjects were randomized. of the 508 subjects who were vaccinated and provided samples 
 for the assessment of immunogenicity, 506 subjects had at least one gp-elisa result for immunogenicity 
 samples collected within the allowed time windows and were included in the gp-elisa fas population. a 
 total of 504 subjects had at least one prnt result for immunogenicity samples collected within the allowed 
 time windows and were included in the prnt fas population. the ratio of male to female in vaccinated 
 participants (58% versus 42%) was balanced. the mean age was 34.4 years of age. 100% of participants 
 were black.</p><p>
 there was no separate randomization process for the subjects in the immunogenicity sub-study, which is 
 acceptable. 
 the trial design included two vaccine arms (immediate or delayed) but no placebo arm. for the 
 immunogenicity analysis, the data of both groups (immediate or delayed) were pooled, hence an 
 assessment of immune responses against v920 compared to placebo cannot be made. 
 immunogenicity analysis population 
 the (full analysis set) fas population served as the primary population for the analysis of 
 immunogenicity and the pp population as the secondary. the fas population included subjects who had 
 at least one gp-elisa result for immunogenicity samples collected within the allowed time windows. the 
 per protocol (pp) population consisted of all randomized and vaccinated subjects with a serology 
 assessment collected within the allowed time window. the pp population excluded subjects having 
 baseline gp-elisa assay results ≥200 eu/ml, violation of certain inclusion/exclusion criteria, and having 
 a missing, unevaluable, or out-of-day-range serology result or sample at a particular time-point. a total 
 of 424 subjects were included in the gp-elisa pp population and 423 subjects were included in the prnt 
 pp population. the exclusion of subjects from the data analysis sets, for both the fas and pp population 
 as well as for the prnt analysis was assessed and deemed acceptable. 
 immunogenicity results 
 seventy-six (15.0%) of the 506 subjects tested at baseline had a baseline gp-elisa ≥200 eu/ml. 
 values for gp-elisa gmts for the fas population were higher than baseline (92.7 eu/ml</p><p>95% ci [85.3,

 overall, 94.1% of subjects had a seroresponse defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 
 eu/ml at any time post vaccination for the gp-elisa. overall, 90% (95 ci 86.8%, 92.7%) of subjects had 
 this seroresponse at month 1. the seroresponse rate only slightly decreased to 87.8% [84.1%, 90.9%] at

 a seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold increase from baseline was overall observed for 79.8% (95% ci

 baseline at any time was observed in 87.3% (95% ci 84.0%, 90.2%) of subjects. 
 prnt gmts were almost comparable at month 1 (116.0 [95% ci 105.7, 127.4]), month 2 (95.3 [95% ci 
 86.3, 105.3]), and month 9-12 (119.9 [95% ci 107.9, 133.2]) (see table 6 above). overall, 81.5% of

 lower gmts, gmfrs, and seroresponses have been observed in the v920-009 and v920-011 trials 
 conducted in sierra leone and liberia compared to the v920-012 trial conducted in the us, spain and

 752, and 761, respectively for the same time points in study v920-011. gmts in study v920-012 were 
 higher at 1262, 1113, and 1078, respectively. 
 whether this is due to the gamma irradiation or to the studied population is difficult to conclude. in 
 addition, the potential clinical implication of this finding is unknown in lack of a correlate of protection.</p></section><section><header>study v920-012</header><p>v920-012 was a phase iii randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot of v920 compared to normal saline placebo 
 in healthy eligible subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years. the rationale for the study was to 
 demonstrate lot consistency and obtain additional safety data. subjects were randomized to 2:2:2:2:1 to 
 receive a single 1ml intramuscular injection of ≥2x10
 7 pfu lot a (n=266), ≥2x107 pfu lot b (n=265), ≥2x10
 7 pfu lot c (n=267), ≥1x108 pfu “high dose lot” (n=266), or placebo (n=133). the trial was conducted at 42 trial centres: 40 in the united states; 1 in canada; and 1 in spain. the 
 immune response was assessed pre vaccination, at 28 days and 6 months post vaccination for all 
 subjects. at the month 6 post vaccination visit (the last visit in the base study), a target population of 600 
 subjects was asked to continue in a trial extension through month 24 post vaccination to evaluate the 
 durability of the v920 immune response. additional blood samples were obtained at months 12, 18, and 
 24 post-vaccination for the evaluation of immunogenicity by gp-elisa and prnt (prnt60). 
 study population 
 healthy, eligible subjects between 18 and 65 years of age were randomised and vaccinated in the 
 v920-012 trial. a total of 1197 subjects were randomized and 1194 (99.7%) subjects were vaccinated.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 1138 (96.9%) subjects completed the month 6 post vaccination visit. of these, 566 (48.2%) subjects entered the trial extension through month 24 post vaccination. during the trial extension 55 of the 566 
 subjects (9.7%) discontinued.</p><p>
 overall, 1039 subjects were included in the pp immunogenicity population on day 1. 
 of the 1197 randomized subjects, 53.2% were female, 67.9% were white, and 85.2% were not hispanic 
 or latino. the median age was 42.0 years (range: 18.0 to 65.0 years). the majority (94.7%) of subjects 
 were enrolled in the us. the baseline characteristics for subjects who enrolled in the extension were 
 generally consistent with those of the overall subject population in the base study. the majority of the 
 subjects who entered the extension were female (55.1%), white (72.4%), and not hispanic or latino 
 (85.9%). the median age was 42.0 years (range: 18 to 65 years). 
 immunogenicity analysis population 
 the pp population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this study. 
 subjects who were seropositive at baseline were excluded from the pp population. no analyses were 
 performed on the fas population because &lt;10% of the subjects were seropositive at baseline. 
 immunogenicity objectives 
 two formal hypotheses were tested. 
 primary immunogenicity objective: 
 1. to determine whether vaccination with v920 from 3 separate consistency lots results in 
 equivalent immunogenicity. 
 hypothesis: the gmt of anti-zebov glycoprotein antibody measured by gp-elisa at 28 days 
 post vaccination will be equivalent across 3 consistency lots. the statistical success criterion for 
 lot consistency requires the 2-sided 95% confidence interval on the pairwise lot-to-lot 
 comparison of the gp-elisa gmt ratio to be greater than 0.5-fold but no more than 2.0-fold. 
 secondary immunogenicity objectives: 
 1. to estimate the anti-zebov gp-elisa gmts measured at 28 days post vaccination in the 3 
 consistency lot groups (lots a, b, and c combined) and the high dose group. 
 no formal hypotheses were tested. 
 2. to estimate the gmts of neutralizing antibodies measured by plaque reduction neutralization test 
 (prnt 60) at 28 days post vaccination in the 3 consistency lot groups (a, b, and c combined) and 
 the high dose group. 
 no formal hypotheses were tested. 
 3. to determine whether vaccination with v920 from 3 separate consistency lots results in 
 equivalent immunogenicity. 
 hypothesis: the geometric mean titre of anti-zebov glycoprotein antibody measured by elisa 
 (gp-elisa) at 28 days post vaccination will be equivalent across 3 consistency lots. the statistical 
 success criterion for lot consistency requires the 2-sided 95% confidence interval on the pairwise 
 lot-to-lot comparison of the gp-elisa gmt ratio to be greater than 0.67- fold but no more than 
 1.50-fold. 
 immunogenicity results 
 the primary and secondary objective to show lot-to-lot consistency between 3 manufacturing lots of v920 
 in respect to immunogenicity was met. equivalence between the 3 manufacturing lots has been shown in</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the primary and the secondary analysis. the lot-to-lot consistency in terms of immunogenicity between the 3 manufacturing lots of v920 at day 28 post vaccination in the primary analysis was demonstrated for 
 the pp cohort as the lower bound of the 95% ci of the gmt ratio between the groups being compared was 
 greater than 0.5 and the upper bound was less than 2.0. also, in all 3 pairwise comparisons in the 
 secondary analysis lot-to-lot consistency could be shown, as the lower bound of the 95% ci of gmt ratio 
 between the comparison lots was greater than 0.67 and the upper bound was less than 1.5 as requested. 
 thirty-one (2.6%) of the 1197 subjects tested had a baseline gp elisa ≥200 eu/ml. 
 gp-elisa gmts were comparable between the 3 manufacturing lots for all time points post vaccination, 
 i.e. from day 28 through month 24. gmts for all 3 lots were highest at day 28 and constantly declined 
 through month 24. the decline was approximately 25% from day 28 to month 24. values for the 
 combined lots group were 1,262.0 [95% ci 1,168.9 to 1,362.6] on day 28 and 920.3 [95% ci 820.4 to 
 1,032.3] at month 24. no meaningful difference between gp-elisa gmts of the 3 manufacturing lots 
 group and the high dose group could be observed. the gmts for the placebo group were less than the 
 lloq of the gp-elisa at all time points. results of the gp-elisa gmts are provided in table 7 below and 
 summarised in table 5 together with results from protocols 009 and 011 (see study v920-009).</p></section><section><header>table 7.</header><p>summary of geometric mean titres by vaccination group (day 1 to month 24) (gp-elisa per-protocol immunogenicity population), v920-012</p><p>

 the v920 groups increased from baseline approximately 64-fold at day 28 post vaccination and remained

 discussion on clinical pharmacology</header><p>the final nominal dose of 2x107 pfu was selected based on protection in nhp challenge model and clinical immunogenicity data that were collected within a phase 1 dose-finding program including 8 clinical trials. 
 the clinical dose-finding program is considered comprehensive and the dose selection of a nominal dose 
 of 2x10
 7 is justified. during the phase 1 clinical trials v920 has been administered across a broad spectrum of dose levels 
 ranging from 3×10
 3 pfu to 1×108 pfu to a total of 795 subjects. immunogenicity was evaluated in europe, us, canada, and in non-epidemic african countries. the phase 1 trials included 197 adult subjects who 
 received a single dose of 2×10
 7 pfu or higher of v920. overall, 135 subjects received placebo in the phase 1 blinded trials. based on the commercial release potency range, the nominal doses of ≥2x10
 7 pfu used in the clinical trials were representative of the commercial dose (i.e. ≥7.2 x 10
 7 pfu). it has to be noted that the vaccine dose of ≥2x10
 7 pfu, designated for clinical trials, was assigned using a non-validated potency assay. during development, a modified potency assay was designed and validated at a new 
 laboratory. the clinical supplies were retested in this validated assay and resulted in a reassignment of 
 the potency value to 7.2 x 10
 7 pfu/dose.</p><p>to quantify total igg binding antibodies against the rvsvδg-zebov-gp, an indirect elisa was used and 
 the psvna or the prnt assays to determine the virus neutralizing antibody levels. psvna was used in 7 
 out of the 8 phase 1 studies but it was not possible to further validate it because of technical limitations. 
 nab were detected with this assay (as with the prnt assay) but a difference between the prnt and the</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 58/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 psvna with respect to nab titres at the late time points was observed. prnt assay was used in 1 out of the 8 studies (study v920-004). both elisa and prnt assays were only validated for the phase 2/3 clinical 
 development program.</p><p>
 the immunogenicity analyses in the clinical development program included gmts, gmfrs, and 
 seroconversion rates. seroconversion was defined as a post-vaccination elisa titre ≥200 eu/ml that was 
 also at least a 4-fold increase in zebov igg compared with baseline in all phase 1 studies. in the phase 
 2/3 trials seroresponse defined as a post-vaccination elisa titre ≥200 eu/ml that was also at least a 
 2-fold increase has been additionally evaluated (primary endpoint). some subjects included in various 
 phase 1 studies were classified as seropositive at baseline. baseline seropositivity could be due to 
 previous ebov exposure but might also be misclassified due to cross-reactivity to other viruses or to the 
 performance of the technique.</p><p>gamma-irradiation may also interfere.</p><p>
 the applicant appropriately clarified the choice of the 200 eu/ml cut-off and the use of a dual criterion to 
 determine a seroresponse. it cannot be excluded that the detection of zebov gp-ab at baseline in a 
 certain proportion of samples could be due to cross-reactivity, however the definition of the seroresponse 
 helps to minimize false-positive results. this is supported by the fact that the proportion of subjects 
 seropositive at baseline in the v920-012 study was comparable to the proportion found in the v920-004 
 study conducted in the us and represent a minority of the study population (n=31/1197, 2.6%). 
 similarly, undetectable previous infection (no circulating ebov-gp ab) or interference with other antigens 
 might cause false-negative results. cmv antigen has been shown to inhibit detection of ebov-gp specific 
 ab. it is not known if this inhibitory capacity is restricted to cmv antigen or if other antigen non-related to 
 ebov may interfere with the performance of the test.</p><p>
 in the absence of ab determination before vaccination or adequate identification of previously infected 
 subjects at baseline, the role of any pre-existing immunity in the protection against ebov infection cannot 
 be strictly determined. both the integrated summary of immunogenicity and correlates of protection 
 reports may help to better understand the relevance of the immunogenicity data to predict protection and 
 will be submitted post-authorisation. 
 the results of the phase 1 trials allowed to assess the anti gp antibody kinetics after vaccination. gmts, 
 gmfrs, and seroconversion rates were higher at all time points after day 14 in the vaccine groups 
 compared with the placebo groups, where overall no immune response was observed. no immune 
 response was observed for any dose of ebov-naïve group on day 7. the immunogenicity of v920 was not 
 evaluated at day 7 in a population with pre-existing ebov-specific ab. 
 antibody titres were measurable to a different extent in all dosing groups on day 14. a dose response was 
 observed with higher gmts, gmfrs, and seroconversion rates in the higher dose groups, at the earlier 
 time points (i.e. on day 14, and less evident on day 28). the difference in gmts and seroconversion 
 between lower and higher dose groups was smaller at later time points since antibody titres tended to 
 continuously increase from day 28 to 180/360 in the lower dosing groups whereas titres in the high dose 
 groups (2x10
 7 pfu and 1x108 pfu) tended to peak earlier (on day 28) and plateaued afterwards with slight to moderate decrease from day 180 to day 360. between the doses 2x10
 7 and 1x108 no notably difference in immune response could be observed. this was confirmed in the phase 3 trial v920-012.</p><p>
 the results from the phase 1 trials were confirmed in the 3 phase 2/3 trials conducted during the time of 
 the 2014 to 2016 ebola outbreak in at-risk populations in liberia (v920-009) and sierra leone 
 (v920-011), as well as a population not at risk (v920-012) in us, canada and spain. v920 elicited a 
 sustainable immune response through month 24 which was the longest follow up time in the phase 2/3 
 clinical development program during licensure (v920-012). antibody peaked on day 28 and more or less 
 plateaued through month 24 with only moderate decrease.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 immunogenicity was evaluated in europe, canada, and the us, as well as in african countries at risk or not at risk for ebola. lower gmts, gmfrs, and seroresponse rates have been observed in the v920-009 
 and v920-011 trials conducted in liberia and sierra leone compared to those observed in the v920-012 
 study conducted in the us, canada and spain. gmts were 995, 712, 661 in v920-009 study on month 1, 
 month 6, and month 12, and 964, 752, and 761, respectively in study v920-011. gmts in study v920-012 
 were 1262, 1113, and 1078, respectively for the same time points.</p><p>whether this is due to the gamma 
 irradiation or to the population is difficult to conclude. in addition, the clinical relevance is unclear since a 
 correlate of protection is not defined. lot-to-lot consistency between three manufacturing lots containing 
 the nominal final dose of 2x10
 7 pfu was demonstrated in study v920-012.</p><p>the trend for prnt gmts is overall comparable to what was observed for the elisa gmts. prnt gmts 
 peaked at day 28 (v920-009 and v920-011 studies) or at month 18 (v920-012 study) and plateau 
 afterwards through month 12 (v920-009 and v920-011 studies) or month 24 (v920-012 study).</p><p>
 in study v920-009 and study v920-011 a higher immune response was observed in females compared 
 with males. a sex-based difference in immune response is known from literature. higher immune 
 responses (elisa gmts) was also observed in subjects with pre-existing immunity, and in hiv-negative 
 individuals compared with hiv-positive subjects. these findings are also known from other vaccines. the 
 nab titres (prnt) were similar, regardless of pre-existing immunity. the clinical relevance of these 
 findings with regard to clinical protection is currently unknown.</p><p>
 immunogenicity was evaluated in 40 younger individuals 6 to 17 years of age. these limited data do not 
 indicate a diminished immunogenicity in the paediatric population of that age. 
 a correlate of protection/protective titre associated with v920 is currently not known. in the efficacy ring 
 trial v920-010 no immunogenicity was evaluated to directly estimate a protecting threshold on individual 
 level. more data may become available post-authorisation.</p><p>
 the antibody kinetic in the phase 1 and phase 2/3 trials suggests a sustainable immune response with 
 slight to moderate but continuous decline of antibodies through 6 to 24 months. this is more evident in 
 the elisa results than in the prnt results. long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of v920 are unknown. 
 without a correlate of protection or knowledge about a protective titre for v920, sustained long-term 
 efficacy cannot be directly inferred from persisting antibody titres by elisa for the time being.</p><p>
 the need (and optimal time point) for a booster dose are unknown. the v920-009 trial is currently 
 ongoing in a 5-year extension to evaluate immunogenicity at months 24, 36, 48, and 60 post-vaccination.</p><p>
 pre-existing immunity to the vsv vector was explored in two phase 1 studies. based on the limited 
 available data, there is currently no indication that pre−existing immunity to vsv would impact 
 v920-induced immunogenicity. in addition, given that vsv is not endemic or epidemic in the eu or africa, 
 it is not anticipated that there will be significant pre-existing anti-vsv immunity present in the areas most 
 at risk of future ebola outbreaks. 
 finally, adaptive (b- and t-cell) and innate responses were to be explored using various techniques such 
 as elispot, flow cytometry or mass spectrometry. results of the exploratory assays will be reviewed and 
 submitted together with the related publications post-approval.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.5">2.4.5.  
 conclusions on clinical pharmacology</header><p>protective immunity against ebola virus infection and disease is not well understood. it seems to be mediated by both humoral and cellular immune responses (both innate and adaptive immunity). the 
 quantity but also the quality of ab (isotype, subclass, epitopes, functionality, etc) are thought to be 
 important for protection and may depend on the cellular immune responses.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 currently, there is no identified immune correlate of protection able to predict efficacy in humans and no immune correlate derived from bridging animal challenge data to humans. 
 the aggregated immunogenicity data in human, i.e. results of both gp-specific ab and 
 zebov-neutralizing ab, support the finally selected dose of ≥2x10
 7 pfu. the data indicate a robust and sustainable immune response induced by v920 at a dose level of ≥2x10
 7 pfu. gp-specific antibody titres were measurable on day 14 and peaked on day 28. a slight to moderate decline of antibodies through 12 
 to 24 months of follow up, in healthy adults from eu, us, canada and african countries was observed 
 thereafter. like for the elisa gmts, prnt gmts were measurable from day 14 through month 12 to 24. 
 the duration of immunogenicity after two years and the need for a booster are currently not known. 
 without a correlate of protection or knowledge about a protective titre for v920, (sustained) efficacy 
 cannot certainly be inferred from the (persisting) antibody titres. the search for statistical correlates of 
 protection that is ongoing might help to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the immune responses. this 
 emphasizes the critical need of effectiveness data to further confirm or document the protective effect of 
 this vaccine.</p><p>

 varied from 50% to 90%. for example, if the vaccine efficacy was 70% and the infection rate 2%, then a 
 total of 190 clusters would be needed (95 in each arm). however, if the vaccine efficacy was 90%, with 
 a 2% infection rate, then a total of 98 clusters would be needed (49 in each arm).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the trial was done in an adaptive manner, for which a two-sided symmetric o’brien-fleming alpha spending strategy truncated at an absolute value of 3.00 was used (the o’brien-fleming threshold for the 
 interim analysis was 0.0027).</p><p>
 this trial was designed in an adaptive fashion with the most likely target being about 100 randomized 
 rings to either immediate or delayed vaccination at the interim analysis and 190 rings at the final analysis. 
 no boundary for futility or low conditional power was pre-specified, although the trial could have been 
 expanded in an adaptive fashion if the observed event rate was lower than expected. the data and safety 
 monitoring board could decide whether to continue or stop the trial, according to success, failure, or 
 insufficient evidence. 
 thus, the exact timing of the interim analyses was not pre-planned and depended on various factors, 
 including, but not limited to, the total number of evd events observed in the trial. in particular, the timing 
 could have been modified if the observed evd rate was higher or lower than the assumed value of 2% 
 during the trial period.</p></section><section><header>randomisation</header><p>randomization was at the level of cluster, not at the individual level. randomization took place only when the numeration of cccs for a ring was closed. the ring randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to either 
 immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination with a single dose of v920. 
 eligible subjects cluster-randomized to immediate vaccination had only one opportunity to give their 
 informed consent (day 0), while eligible subjects assigned to the delayed clusters had 2 opportunities to 
 consent, on day 0 and on day 21. 
 due to the identified consenting issues in 363 individuals (documented in monitoring reports), a 
 re-consenting effort was implemented by the trained trial team for all individuals in rings 1 to 90 who had 
 not yet completed their last visit as a means to ensure that the consent was documented appropriately. 
 the rate of subjects consenting on day 0 is around 20% higher in the immediate vaccination arm 
 (2151/3232 = 66.6%) than in the delayed vaccination arm (1435/3096 = 46.4%). this might suggest 
 that randomization results were known to a large extent prior to consenting. the impact of this potential 
 selection bias is not known.</p></section><section><header>blinding (masking)</header><p>the study was open label, so blinding of participants and investigators/field teams was not possible. the vaccine vials had the manufacturer’s labelling and were not designed for a specific subject. 
 the guinea national ebola surveillance team and the trial team were independent of each other; the trial 
 team did not communicate any specific information regarding any of the listed contacts and contacts of 
 contacts to the surveillance teams and associated laboratories. for example, it did not provide 
 information with regards to which evd index cases were used to form a new ring or which people would 
 be included in a given cluster or ring. surveillance laboratory staff was therefore blinded to the 
 randomization to the immediate or delayed vaccination or vaccination status of any suspected case 
 sample being tested. 
 information about the allocation to immediate or delayed vaccination was made available for a given ring 
 only after the enumeration of the ring members was completed and registering the ring with the dmc at 
 ctu bern. to conceal randomization until all informed consents had been obtained for a given ring, the 
 file(s) containing information about allocation were not opened by any person involved in recruiting 
 participants and other trial personnel (including the statistician responsible for the data analysis) until the</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 primary analysis was completed. if such file(s) were opened, a signed and dated note-to-file was stored in the respective subfolder of the ctu bern trial file indicating the name of the person who opened it, 
 responsible person who authorized the opening, and reason for the opening.</p></section><section><header>statistical methods</header><p>the incidence of evd was compared between the 2 arms over defined time periods measured from the time of randomization of each ring. vaccine efficacy and effectiveness were estimated as the overall 
 reduction in the evd incidence in rings that were randomized to immediate vaccination compared to those 
 randomized to delayed vaccination. ve was defined as 1- the hazard ratio for evd (i.e., the estimated 
 hazard of evd for individuals in a ring that receives immediate vaccination over the estimated hazard of 
 evd for individuals in a ring that receives delayed vaccination). 
 the operational definition of per protocol analysis period censored events of evd occurring &lt;d days after 
 vaccination (immediate arm) or after enrolment (delayed arm). in practice, d was later set at 10 days. 
 thus, by default, only confirmed evd cases occurring ≥10 days post-randomization were valid endpoints 
 for the trial to account for the incubation and vaccine response periods.</p><p>
 in the delayed vaccination arm, participants were administratively censored 10 days after vaccination. 
 participants in the immediate vaccination arm were administratively censored on the same date as the 
 last participant censored in the delayed vaccination arm or at 84 days (end of follow-up period), 
 whichever comes first. any individual who is lost to follow-up was censored at the last known date of 
 observation.</p><p>
 vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness against evd was assessed across 9 different populations (see 
 table 9 below). many of these analyses were suggested in published commentary or based on feedback 
 from regulatory agencies. in addition, 8 out of these 9 populations described in table 9 (except population 
 #2) were used to assess vaccine efficacy against the evd death endpoint. 
 the primary analysis (not pre-specified) compared subjects vaccinated at day 0 in the immediate arm vs. 
 subjects who consented on day 0 in the delayed arm for the estimation of vaccine efficacy.</p></section><section><header>table 9.</header><p>v920-010: study populations for primary and secondary analyses</p><p>
 of note, the primary analysis in published literatures compared all vaccinated in immediate arm versus all 
 eligible subjects assigned to delayed vaccination arm (population #3). based on relative clarity regarding</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 timing of consent on day 0, subjects labelled in the database as consented at day 0 were proposed to be utilized as the final primary efficacy analysis population in this submitted csr (population #1). 
 vaccine effectiveness calculations were based on an estimation of the overall reduction in evd in rings 
 including vaccinated and non-vaccinated subjects. the estimation of transmission parameters was not 
 completed at the time of the evaluation procedure. 
 finally, the applicant included an analysis to compare the incidence of evd with onset before the 10-day 
 post-vaccination cut-off in the immediate versus the delayed vaccination clusters. this analysis served to 
 respond to a regulatory agency comment on interim results of the trial. 
 dsmb recommendation 
 an independent dsmb was incorporated in the protocol to review efficacy and safety data on a monthly 
 basis. on 3 july 2015, an interim analysis was performed based on 48 clusters in the immediate arm and 
 42 clusters in the delayed arm. the primary analysis compared all vaccinated individuals from the 
 immediate arm with all eligible individuals in the delayed arm. at 10 days or more post-randomisation, no 
 cases of confirmed evd occurred in the immediate arm compared with 16 cases (from 7 rings) in the 
 delayed arm. results showed 100% efficacy, but p-value did not cross the interim stopping threshold of 
 0.0027 for efficacy (p-value 0.0036 according to fisher’s exact test comparing the proportions of clusters 
 with one or more eligible case).</p><p>
 due to the low likelihood of being able to recruit substantial numbers of additional rings, the dsmb 
 decided to stop randomization and to immediately vaccinate all eligible subjects in any newly identified 
 rings. in addition, the trial was extended to areas of sierra leone adjoining the border of guinea and was 
 amended to include children 6 to 17 years of age.</p></section><section><header>results subject disposition and baseline demographic characteristics</header><p>a total of 476 confirmed evd cases were identified. of these, 361 cases were excluded and rings were not defined around them. the majority (76%) of excluded cases were due to distance, delayed reporting, or 
 inadequate study team capacity. therefore, rings were defined for the remaining 115 cases in guinea and 
 for 2 additional cases from sierra-leone, resulting in a total of 117 rings comprising a total of 11,841 
 cccs. 
 among 11,841 subjects enrolled into the trial, 9,096 subjects were from 98 randomized clusters, 
 comprising of 4,539 cccs (51 clusters) in immediate vaccination arm and 4,557 cccs (47 clusters) in 
 delayed vaccination arm.</p><p>
 of 19 non-randomized clusters (2,745 cccs), 3 rings were constituted before randomization was initiated 
 (i.e. pilot phase of trial) and 16 constituted after randomization discontinuation as per the dsmb 
 recommendation. only immediate vaccination was available for subjects in the non-randomized clusters. 
 the proportion of cccs eligible for vaccination with v920 was 71% (3,232/4,539) in the immediate arm 
 and 68% (3,096/4,557) in the delayed arm. the proportion of cccs who were eligible and provided 
 consent is lower for the subjects randomized to immediate (47%) vs. delayed vaccination arms (56%) 
 (respectively 2151 and 2539 including 1435 consenting on day 0). overall, the vaccination rate was 66% 
 (2,119/3,232) in the immediate arm and 66% (2,041/3,096) among the eligible subjects of the delayed 
 arm who gave consent either on day 0 or day 21. 
 the median age for 117 index cases was 35 years in both the immediate and delayed randomized rings 
 and 23 years in the non-randomized rings. overall, females comprised 59.8% of the index cases.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 approximately 77% of the clusters in the randomized arms were located in rural areas, compared to 47% of clusters in the non-randomized group (table 10).</p></section><section><header>table 10.</header><p>v910-010 – baseline characteristics of index cases and clusters</p><p> 
 the index cases and clusters randomly allocated to immediate vaccination vs. delayed vaccination were 
 generally comparable at baseline, including age of index cases, the time from symptom onset to 
 hospitalization/isolation of index cases or inclusion of clusters, and location of clusters (table 10). 
 the proportion of index cases that were dead at the time of randomization was slightly higher in the 
 delayed arm compared to the immediate arm, which did not appear to result in more high-risk contacts in 
 delayed arm (table 11 below). the average cluster size in delayed vaccination arm was 30.5 compared to 
 42.2 in immediate vaccination arm, when the primary analysis is restricted to eligible subjects who 
 consented on day 0 only. 
 the majority of eligible cccs were male, with females comprising 30% to 37% of consented subjects in 
 the randomized rings and 35% in the non-randomized group (table 11 below). the mean age of 
 consenting cccs was 35 years. there were 536 eligible, consented subjects ≥65 years of age, and 194 
 children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were enrolled in nonrandomized group and vaccinated 
 (table 11 below). 
 the baseline characteristics of the eligible cccs with consenting status in the immediate versus the 
 delayed arms are presented in table 11 below. the two arms are largely comparable. 
 notably, more than 80% of consenting cccs were the contacts of contacts of the index cases (table 11). 
 the proportion of contacts classified as high-risk was slightly higher in the immediate vaccination arm 
 (15%), compared with subjects in the delayed vaccination arm who consented on day 0 (12%) and 
 subjects who consented on day 21 (5%).</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 until the last visit (day 84) was completed and the rings were considered closed. 
 protocol amendments: 
 this clinical trial was implemented according to v0.3 of the protocol and its subsequent amended 
 versions, v0.4 (written after the interim analysis) and v0.5. 
 there were changes in the inclusion/exclusion criteria in protocol v0.3, v0.4 and v0.5. 
 protocol v0.4 (dated 08 july 2015) was implemented following the dsmb meeting of 03 july 2015 (see 
 above).</p><p>
 in addition to clarifications and wording corrections, the other principal changes from v0.3 to v0.4 were: 
 •</p><p>included the decision of the dsmb meeting of 03-jul-2015 to allow enrolment of adolescents (12 
 to 18-year-old) and to stop allocation into the delayed arm. 
 •</p><p>included the decision to allow enrolment of children 6-12 years (dependent on safety results, 
 expected 4 weeks later).</p><p>
 fifty-five protocol deviation reports were completed, which enumerated impact to 819 subjects. eighteen 
 of the 55 reports also described deviations impacting multiple subjects but did not identify the exact 
 subjects impacted (6 of which described conventions for capturing data in source or crf, which were 
 applied generally throughout the trial, but did not necessarily impact all subjects). 
 seven reports were identified as presenting risk to the subject (or another person’s) safety, rights, or

 an independent audit (performed by external contractor) was organized by the sponsor (who) in guinea 
 (audit and follow up visit in august 2015 and november 12, 2015) as well as in who headquarters, 
 geneva, switzerland (23 september 2015). 
 the scope of the audit was as follows: (i) sponsor’s organization, facilities, equipment, operating 
 procedures, in guinea; (ii) on site investigations (vaccination and follow-up); (iii) coordination and 
 synergy with the national ebola response program; (iv) data verification, consistency between crfs and 
 electronic data-base; (v) e-trial master file and investigator site file. 
 the objectives of this audit were: gcp compliance of the trial-related activities, with review of provisions 
 regarding: (i) safety, rights and well-being of participants; (ii) reliability and credibility of the trial data. 
 the csr states that no critical observations were reported and no instances that would cause concern

 based on a request from the fda and reflects a more conservative analysis. even though a different 
 population was used for the primary vs. the interim analysis, from a statistical perspective multiplicity 
 should be accounted for. therefore during the procedure the applicant was asked to provide confidence

 other analyses including vaccine effectiveness using a variety of populations, such as all randomized

 during days 0-9 post-vaccination, 11 evd cases occurred in the immediate arm and 3 in the delayed arm 
 (symptom onset on days 0, 6, or 6 post-vaccination), and 10 cases in the non-randomized group. 
 from randomization to day 21 in the delayed arm, 13 cases were reported, 6 cases with onset from 
 randomization to day 9, and 7 cases with onset from day 10 to day 21 following randomization. 
 kaplan-meier curves 
 kaplan-meier curves show that the incidence of evd cases in the first 10 days following vaccination or 
 enrolment was similar in the immediate, delayed, and nonrandomized clusters (figure 2 below). 
 however, no evd cases occurred ≥10 days post-vaccination in any group. 
 no evd cases after 32 days post-randomization were identified in randomized and non-randomized 
 clusters in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting that v920 might have contributed to 
 the interruption of ebola transmission. 
 overall, the assessment of the durability of protection in this design is limited. aligning the interval of 
 efficacy assessment in both immediate and delayed vaccination arms allows for the conclusion that 
 duration of protection is of at least 31 days.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 discussion on clinical efficacy 
 design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>v920-010 is a field-based, phase 3, open-label, cluster-randomized, controlled, ring vaccination trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of 1 dose of v920 in the prevention of evd 
 when implemented as ring vaccination. the study sponsor was who. the study was conducted in guinea 
 during the 2014–2016 outbreak of evd in west africa. a cluster (ring) consisted of all contacts and 
 contacts-of-contacts (cccs) of the index case (new case of a laboratory-confirmed evd in the trial area). 
 clusters were randomized to immediate arm (vaccination 1-2 days after randomization) or delayed 
 (control) arm (vaccination 21 days later) in a 1:1 ratio. subjects were followed from the constitution of 
 the ring up to 84 days after the vaccination through study visits by the trial’s team. the moh/who 
 surveillance team visited the subjects up to 21 days after the contact (contact tracing). new cases of evd 
 admitted to the ebola treatment centres (etc) were reported by the moh/who centre. evd cases were 
 confirmed by pcr. 
 the ring vaccination design is an innovative alternative in an outbreak setting to allow for a pragmatic 
 conduct. although more prone to biases compared to an individually randomised trial, this design was 
 much more likely to yield robust data on the efficacy of the vaccine despite the low and declining 
 incidence. 
 overall, the definitions of contacts and contact-of-contacts and eligibility criteria are endorsed. a new 
 cluster was defined if at least 60% of the cccs were not enumerated in a previous cluster. the</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 geographical distribution of the rings suggest that important overlaps may have occurred in the largest prefectures, however individuals geographically located in several rings were assigned to and vaccinated 
 as part of the first ring in which they were included. as there is no data to quantify the extent of 
 geographical overlap between clusters, biases due to this overlap cannot be excluded. for example, it is 
 questioned whether the proportion of subjects who were exposed to 2 or more index cases was 
 comparable between the immediate and the delayed arms. the impact of potential bias remains uncertain 
 as no sensitivity analyses accounting for overlapping clusters could be performed. 
 objectives and endpoints 
 the aim of the study was to assess efficacy (primary analysis) over a defined period of time of 21 days and 
 effectiveness over a broader period of 84 days after randomisation.</p><p>
 asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic cases were described during the west african outbreak. however, 
 the study was designed to detect cases of evd using the standard who case definition, with fever as key 
 symptom, and not to detect possible subclinical cases of evd. the use of confirmed evd as primary 
 efficacy endpoint is consistent with who guidelines. for this trial, only rt-pcr assay was used for 
 laboratory confirmation of ebola infection. 
 blinding 
 the v920-010 trial is open-label. the evd case detection in the field was not blinded to the subject’s 
 allocation status. the direction and magnitude of any resulting bias is unknown. the group allocation 
 information was not communicated to the national surveillance lab staff.</p><p>
 statistical analyses 
 the incidence of evd was compared between the 2 arms over defined time periods measured from the 
 date of first vaccination within the ring for subjects in the immediate arm, and the date of first enrolment 
 within the ring for subjects in the delayed vaccination arm. 
 cases of ebola occurring &lt;10 days after randomization/enrolment were censored. the time after which 
 the vaccine is perceived to provide full protection in the vaccinees was selected by default to be at least 
 10 days after randomization, taking account of both the incubation time and the putative 
 vaccine-response period. the 10-day censoring period was specified prior to the conduct of the efficacy 
 analyses with the intention to minimize the post-exposure effect in the efficacy analyses. a protective 
 effect of v920 against evd cases was expected in contacts-of-contacts. in practice, the effect was mainly 
 seen in contacts, which could include post-exposure effect. 
 the populations compared for the primary efficacy analyses were not pre-specified. the primary efficacy 
 interim analysis compared all subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm versus all subjects eligible in the 
 delayed arm. after that analysis was published, the fda requested that the primary efficacy analysis 
 focus on all subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm compared to all subjects who consented on the day 
 0 visit in the delayed arm. this approach is considered appropriate as the subset consenting on day 21 is 
 highly biased in particular because it discards subjects who presented evd during the relevant period (i.e. 
 0 to 21 days). the secondary analysis estimating the overall ring vaccination effectiveness in protecting 
 all cccs was pre-specified. it is considered as the intention-to-treat analysis and the less susceptible to 
 selection bias, hence the most valid.</p><p>
 statistical methods were only very briefly defined in the protocol and sap. furthermore, the methods 
 used to derive the results for the primary endpoint were not pre-specified in the protocol and sap, 
 however the applied test is considered to be a conservative approach.</p><p>
 the sponsor planned to conduct an interim analysis after approximately 100 clusters. the interim 
 analysis results were not significant based on the pre-planned multiplicity adjustment, but randomization</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>

 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 in the trial was stopped by the dsmb because of the low probability of being able to recruit substantial numbers of additional rings (given the declining number of cases of ebola virus disease in the country). 
 the applicant presented these data in the csr without multiplicity adjustment and conducted one 
 post-hoc analysis, i.e. the interim analysis, which was used as primary analysis using the full alpha. using 
 the full alpha at interim after stopping the trial is not considered a suitable approach as it would always 
 allow rejecting the null hypothesis at the full alpha level at interim. this approach is hence not considered 
 sufficient to control the type 1 error rate. the study is considered to have failed to meet its primary 
 endpoint; an adjusted confidence interval was therefore also provided in the smpc. 
 all analyses were done at the cluster level, and hence the high intra-class correlation coefficient (icc) was 
 included in the analyses. a bayesian model with beta prior for probability of evd and treatment effect as 
 only covariate was used. the underlying assumptions and consequences of the bayesian model are 
 uncertain. stratification factors were not taken into account in any of the analysis. as using stratification 
 factors in the analysis model usually helps to reduce heterogeneity, the approach taken is considered to 
 be conservative and is hence acceptable. 
 conduct of the study 
 the trial was conducted in the region of basse-guinée, a coastal area of guinea, and comprised 7 
 prefectures in guinea (including conakry). this area was the only area of guinea in which cases of evd 
 were confirmed at the time of the start of the study. two prefectures in sierra leone were added during 
 the non-randomised phase. after the randomisation phase, the protocol was amended to include children 
 and adolescents from 6 years of age. 
 the trial team headquarters was located in conakry. the trial’s field teams travelled from the 
 headquarters to the temporary trial ring sites to conduct the visits. this trial was performed in particularly 
 challenging logistical circumstances.</p><p>
 several concerns about gcp potential compliance issues which may impact on data accuracy were raised 
 during the assessment: (i) inconsistencies between protocol, csr, published papers; (ii) monitoring was 
 regularly performed at the sponsor&apos;s coordination center in conakry, but study sites were not monitored; 
 (iii) one independent audit organized by the sponsor in august 2015 (after most subjects completed the 
 randomisation phase) raises several major gcp concerns. in particular: operations of the activity of the 
 sponsor and the investigator are not described in a consolidated manner in the study procedures, 
 inconsistencies were found between the database and the source documents including with respect to 
 saes.</p><p>
 considering the limitations of the trial given the specific circumstances in which it was conducted (i.e. in 
 africa during an ebola outbreak), the lack of study sites available for an inspection, the unmet medical 
 need for a prophylactic intervention against evd, and given the context of the ongoing who-declared 
 public health emergency of international concern (pheic) in the democratic republic of congo (drc), 
 the request for a gcp inspection has been waived.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>the study randomised 4539 cccs (3232 eligible) in 51 clusters, 4557 cccs (3096 eligible) in 47 clusters over approximately 4 months while the epidemic was ending.</p><p>

 the immediate clusters was recruited during the first third of the period as compared to the delayed

 the median size of the clusters was similar in both arms (80 cccs in immediate vaccination groups and 81 cccs in delayed vaccination groups). however, the cluster size was not balanced across arms for the 
 primary analysis (average ring size in terms of participants who consented prospectively was 42.2 and 
 30.5 respectively in the immediate and delayed arms). this may bias the cluster-level analysis but not in 
 favour of the vaccine. 
 the proportion of eligible cccs was approximately 70% for both arms, the main reason for non-eligibility 
 being age below the lower limit (6 years). eligible cccs who were cluster-randomized to delayed clusters 
 had two opportunities to consent. in this arm, 31% of cccs consented on day 0 (versus 47% in the 
 immediate arm), and 24% of the cccs consented on day 21.</p><p>
 demographic data for the subsets of eligible subjects who consented on day 0 is comparable across arms, 
 and the same applies for the proportion of contacts-of-contacts (80%) vs. contacts (20%), supporting the 
 primary analysis. the proportion of high-risk contacts was however slightly different (15% vs 12% 
 respectively in the immediate and delayed arms. the subsets used for the (primary) analyses could differ 
 with respect to other important characteristics predicting the evd, such as the time interval between the 
 onset of symptoms in the index case and the context, and the nature and frequency of the contacts. 
 numbers analysed and attack rates of evd cases 
 a total of 105 cases of confirmed evd were identified during the pilot and post-randomization phase 
 (n=19) and the main study phase (n=86, of which 36 pertained to the immediate clusters and 50 to the 
 delayed clusters). all confirmed evd cases used for the main outcome were reaffirmed by repeat testing 
 at the european mobile laboratory (eml).</p><p>
 during the randomization phase, most cases of confirmed evd occurred &lt;10 days after randomization
 1 (70% and 50% in the immediate and delayed arms), reflecting the fact that nearly all cases occurred in (high-risk
 2) contacts who were likely already exposed to infection before randomization. there was no effect of vaccination on evd cases that occurred &lt;10 days after randomization (attack rates 0.4-0.8% 
 whatever the subset). in contrast, no evd case occurred ≥10 days after randomization in those 
 vaccinated immediately, while 10 cases occurred in the delayed arm in those consenting on day 0. for 
 this primary comparison, attack rates were respectively 0.0% and 0.7%. attack rates were similar for 
 subjects assigned to the delayed vaccination rings (0.5%) or not vaccinated in the immediate rings 
 (0.6%).</p><p>
 of the study population, 20% were contacts and 80% were contacts-of-contacts. in contrast, of all the 27 
 evd cases (10 cases that occurred &lt;10 days and 17 cases that occurred ≥10 days) which occurred in the 
 population used for the primary analysis, nearly all (n=23) were contacts (of these, 16 were high-risk 
 contacts), and only 4 were contacts-of-contacts (3 of them occurred ≥10 days). thus, as expected, there 
 was an overrepresentation of (high-risk) contacts amongst evd cases, especially in evd case that 
 occurred &lt;10 days from randomisation.</p><p>
 there was no evd case that occurred ≥10 days post-vaccination (i.e. ≥31 days after randomisation in the 
 controls) among the 5,837 subjects who received the v920 vaccine in all 117 rings, both randomized 
 (immediate, delayed) and non-randomized. in the delayed arm, 4 cases of evd ≥10 days 
 post-randomization were reported in vaccinees, but all occurred within 10 days of vaccination.</p><p>

 the v920 vaccine demonstrated to be efficacious after a single im administration at the intended dose of 2 x 10
 7 pfu, in preventing evd in the studied population. the primary analysis shows a ve of 100% (95%ci: 63.5 to 100% and p-value 0.0471 without multiplicity adjustment; adjusted 95%ci: 14.4 to 
 100% based on 0 cases in the immediate arm and 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed arm). randomization 
 was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre-specified alpha level of 
 0.0027. the final analysis was conducted on 98 clusters and the interim analysis on 90 clusters, thus 
 formally only confidence intervals and p-values adjusted using the pre-planned alpha-spending approach 
 should be reported.</p><p> 
 as the estimation of ve was based on only 4 clusters with 10 confirmed evd cases ≥10 days after 
 randomization, the result is formally not statistically significant and confidence intervals are very wide. 
 this adds uncertainty regarding the actual level of protection induced by the vaccine.</p><p>
 a secondary analysis to include all eligible subjects in the delayed arm yielded consistent results, except 
 the 95%ci lower bound changed to 68.9%. furthermore, preplanned secondary analyses on evd death 
 are consistent with the primary analysis.</p><p>
 the secondary vaccine effectiveness analyses comparing all cccs (i.e., including non-eligible and 
 non-vaccinated subjects, itt analysis) or comparing all eligible subjects indicates trends of vaccine 
 benefit but was statistically inconclusive. in this particular trial, the itt analysis leads to the overall 
 vaccine effectiveness, by comparing the cluster-level incidence in immediately vaccinated clusters 
 (including all cccs who did not receive the vaccine) versus delayed clusters. the overall vaccine 
 effectiveness is a valuable public health measure reflecting the overall utility of the strategy.</p><p>
 efficacy was found in a population mixing contacts and contacts-of-contacts. of the 10 cases included in 
 the primary analysis after the censored period of 10 days post-vaccination, 7 were contacts and 3 were 
 contacts-of-contacts. 
 whilst it is considered that vaccine efficacy is demonstrated despite the limitations, it is difficult to 
 differentiate any effect of pre-exposure vs. post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) because the trial was not 
 designed to assess this. the robustness of the data in favour of a ‘pure’ pre-exposure effect is hampered 
 by the limited number of cases that occurred in contacts-of-contacts (3 cases vs. 7 cases in contacts) of 
 the yet-to-be-vaccinated delayed (control) arm. however, these data are consistent with the 
 demonstration of protection that was shown in the nhp model. 
 median time from symptom onset to hospitalization/isolation in the index cases was approximately 4 days 
 in both arms, which is consistent with the literature, and median time from symptoms onset in the index 
 case to randomization was 10-11 days. at randomisation, 59% and 68% of the index cases had died 
 (immediate and delayed respectively). this shows that contacts, especially those at high-risk, were likely 
 already exposed since several days when vaccinated, and thus may already have contracted the infection 
 when vaccinated (average incubation period for ebola is 8-10 days [min-max 2–21 days]). as underlined 
 in the csr, evd cases in contacts may not have been fully averted unless there was a post-exposure 
 prophylactic effect from the vaccine. however, since vaccination had an effect on evd with onset &gt;10 
 days post-randomization period and not before, the vaccine may have no effect when administered late 
 after exposure.</p><p>
 data for pep in the context of laboratory and health-care workers in europe/us is very limited. seven 
 cases were reported by the applicant, with varied potential exposures to ebola, and they were given v920 
 around 2 days after the accident. none developed evidence of ebola virus infection or disease. the 
 nominal dose used was ranging from 5x10
 7 pfu/ml to ≥1×108 pfu/ml, thus in the range of the doses used in the trials. in contrast with preventive protection, there are very limited nc data on post exposure 
 effects. only a small nc challenge study in rhesus macaques suggests post-exposure efficacy.</p><p>
 duration of protection</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 84/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 given the trial’s design, efficacy/effectiveness was studied only over a short period of approximately three weeks (10 to 31 days post-randomization). the duration of the vaccine’s protective effect in the 
 prevention of evd is thus unknown. in addition, data from nhp challenge studies on the potential 
 durability of v920 in protecting against ebov are considered limited at this time (see section 2.3). data 
 from a nhp study showed only partial protection (&lt;50%) at month 3 after a single im dose of v920, and 
 interestingly unprotected vaccinated animals still had substantial amounts of antibodies measured by 
 elisa and prnt50. given the existing nhp data, and especially the current unknowns about both the 
 specific mechanism of protection against evd and a protective antibody titre, caution needs to be 
 exercised to infer the v920 vaccine protection duration based on the immunogenicity data. it is important 
 that more data is collected in order to understand duration of protection and need for booster doses in the 
 context of the ongoing and future ebola outbreaks.</p><p>
 limitations of the ring vaccination trial data</p><p>
 many sources of biases are present, which are an integral part of the uncertainties around the results: 
 informed consent given based on the knowledge of the assigned group; potential failures in contact 
 tracing; lack of clarity or inconsistencies in case detection and matching processes; potential differences 
 in exposure to study teams during the primary endpoint ascertainment period with a possible impact on 
 the knowledge and behaviour. the impact and direction of potential biases is not known.</p><p>
 the intra-class correlation coefficient (icc) was unexpectedly high due to the clustering of 6 confirmed 
 endpoint evd cases in one of the rings. this shows that specific transmission pathways occurred at the 
 local level. the impact of the lack of independency of evd events is a loss of power, but also possible 
 biases due to imbalance between arms as specific chains of transmission may have occurred at the level 
 of a few rings.</p><p>
 although it is currently not known which epitopes are responsible for the immune protective responses, 
 no data suggest that v920 is not efficacious against all strains of zaire ebolavirus. immunogenicity of 
 v920 suggests that the immune responses are at least as robust in subjects living in non-endemic regions 
 as in endemic regions. it is unlikely that v920-induced immune response will be impaired by pre-existing 
 anti-vsv immunity. based on limited data, pre-existing immunity to ebola virus defined by the selected 
 cut-off does not appear to have a negative impact on the immunogenicity of v920. thus, there is a priori 
 no rationale to anticipate lower vaccine efficacy in eu subjects (non-endemic) compared to african 
 subjects from endemic countries.</p><p>
 limitations remain in terms of the extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in a ring vaccination context to 
 a prophylactic vaccination context. 
 given the important limitations of the currently available efficacy data, and in the absence of a correlate 
 of protection, there is a need to generate additional data to further confirm the vaccine’s clinical effect. it 
 will not be possible to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of v920 in eu subjects in a future randomized 
 clinical trial. thus, coordinated efforts to generate vaccine effectiveness data from contexts with 
 long-lasting or recurrent outbreaks are essential.</p></section><section><header n="2.5.3">2.5.3.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>in combination with non-clinical data, the results of the pivotal v920-010 ring vaccination trial “ebola ça suffit” provided evidence that a single im dose of the v920 vaccine at a concentration of 2 x 10
 7 pfu is efficacious to prevent evd in adults at risk of infection during an outbreak setting. 
 however, uncertainties remain as to the actual level of protection, the duration of protection and the type 
 of protection (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis) given the methodological limitations and the 
 exceptional circumstances experienced during a declining ebola epidemic as discussed above.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the findings present many important limitations in terms of internal validity and precision of the efficacy estimate. in addition, data may lack the reliability usually expected from a pivotal randomised 
 placebo-controlled trial, which however was unavoidable given the exceptional circumstances in which 
 the trial was conducted and its alternative design.</p><p>
 the chmp considers the following measures necessary to address the limitations related to efficacy data: 
 •</p><p>there is limited data in hiv-infected individuals. immunogenicity will be further investigated in 
 these subjects in study v920-015 (achiv); 
 •</p><p>there is limited data on duration of protection and on long term follow up data. duration of 
 immunogenicity will be addressed in study v920-016 (prevac), in study v920-009 (prevail) 
 and in study v920-005 (geneva).

 clinical safety 
 patient exposure</header><p>the clinical development program to assess safety consisted of 12 trials mostly blinded, but also open label trials. 8 phase i trials and 4 phase ii and iii trials were conducted. these trials were designed and 
 conducted independently by a number of different sponsors in the same timeframe in response to the 
 ebola outbreak in 2014.</p><p>
 a total of 15,997 adult subjects were vaccinated with v920 in the 12 clinical trials (see table below); 
 15,399 of these subjects received 2 × 10
 7 plaque forming units (pfu)/dose or higher of v920. safety was evaluated in all trials. the trials also included approximately 536 eligible, consented adults ≥65 years of 
 age, 234 children 6 to 17 years of age, as well as 278 women who were incidentally found to be pregnant 
 during the clinical trials and 22 hiv-positive individuals. 
 the phase 2/3 placebo-controlled randomized trials (protocol 009 and protocol 012) comprised 500 
 african subjects of liberia and 1061 subjects of us, spain and canada.</p></section><section><header>table 18.</header><p>summary of exposure to v920 by study (protocols: 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, and 012)

 and used varying methods for data collection (e.g., phone contact with subjects vs in-person visits). the 
 trials were not designed or conducted by the various sponsors with the final objective of data integration 
 among them. consequently, the datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated to provide a 
 meaningful and interpretable integrated dataset. it was feasible to integrate sae data from blinded trials 
 because of the more uniform collection methods for saes across trials. sae data from open-label trials 
 were not included in this integration, as unblinded safety assessments are potentially subject to bias. 
 data from the 2 large, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 trials, v920-009 
 and v920-012, provide the basis of the primary safety assessment for v920. data from the 2 large 
 open-label trials, v920-010 and v920- 011, as well as the 8 phase 1 trials, provide supportive safety 
 information. 
 the majority of subjects who received v920 in each of the phase 1 blinded trials experienced solicited 
 injection-site aes (43.1% to 86.7%, v920 combined dose groups) and systemic aes (59.6% to 98.3%, 
 v920 combined dose groups) through 14 days post-vaccination, and the proportions of v920 recipients 
 who reported aes were higher compared with subjects who received placebo ([10.6% to 33.3%] and 
 [33.3 to 100%], respectively). within the v920-groups in the different trials a heterogeneous reporting 
 rate from 15% to 50% for arthralgia was observed. myalgia, objective fever, and subjective fever were 
 reported with a higher incidence in the v920 groups compared to placebo groups. objective fever was 
 generally reported as mild in intensity in the v920 phase i blinded trials, but 3 subjects experienced 
 severe objective fever. 
 in each of the v920 phase 1 open-label trials, the most commonly reported solicited injection-site ae 
 through 14 days post-vaccination in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group was injection-site pain. the majority of solicited injection-site aes was reported within the first day (≤24 hours) following vaccination. 
 the median durations of injection-site pain, redness/erythema, and swelling reported for the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group ranged from 1.5 to 3.0 days, 1.0 to 3.0 days, and 1.0 to 8.0 days, respectively. in each of the v920 phase 1 open-label trials, the most commonly reported solicited systemic aes in the 
 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group through 14 days post-vaccination were headache (50.0% to 60.0%), fever (v920-006; reported as pyrexia in v920-007 and objective fever in v920-008) (30.0% to 56.3%), fatigue 
 (10.0% to 55.0%), myalgia (12.5% to 70.0%), and arthralgia (10.0% to 25.0%). 
 unsolicited systemic aes associated with lab abnormalities that were reported in the v920 phase 1 blinded 
 trials were generally not reported in the open-label trials. only 1 adult subject in the 2 × 10

 v920 group of the v920-007 trial reported an ae of abnormal hepatic function. the majority of vaccine-related unsolicited systemic aes were mild to moderate in intensity. the only severe 
 vaccine-related unsolicited systemic aes reported for subjects in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group was malaise and muscle tightness (in the phase i trial v920-006).</p></section><section><header>phase 2/3 trials</header><p> injection-site reactions the main studies to evaluate non-serious aes are the field-based study v920-009 and the 
 applicant-sponsored study v920-012, both double-blinded and placebo-controlled and respectively 
 comprised 498 african subjects of liberia and 798 subjects in us, spain and canada. 
 in the v920-009 trial, subjects were prompted at each safety follow-up visit to report injection-site 
 reactions, which were defined as a composite term of injection-site pain/tenderness or local reaction 
 (defined as erythema or swelling, with severity grades: mild – moderate –blistering – 
 ulceration/necrosis/potentially life threatening). all subjects who experienced injection-site reaction 
 reported injection-site pain, and few reported local reactions at any time point (30 minutes, week 1, or 
 month 1). injection-site pain was reported for 34.0% and 11.2% of subjects in the v920 and placebo 
 groups, respectively, at any time point, and was most prevalent at the week 1 visit (30.7% and 6.8% of 
 subjects in the v920 and placebo groups, respectively). the maximum intensities for aes of injection-site 
 pain and local reaction at any time point were mild or moderate.</p><p>
 in the v920-012 trial, subjects were prompted to report the injection-site aes of erythema, pain, and 
 swelling on the vaccination report card (vrc) on days 1 to 5 post vaccination. a majority (72.3% to 
 70.4%, respectively) of subjects in the v920 combined lots (2x10
 7 pfu/dose) and high dose (1x108 pfu/dose) groups reported vrc-prompted injection-site aes during the first 5 days post vaccination, compared with 14.3% of subjects in the placebo group. the most frequently reported injection-site aes in 
 each group were injection-site pain, followed by injection-site swelling, and injection-site erythema, with 
 no evident dose dependency. the majority of injection-site aes were mild to moderate in intensity, with 
 a median duration of 1 to 3 days.</p><p>systemic adverse events 
 the frequency of the following systemic aes was reported in a higher proportion of vaccinated subjects 
 compared with subjects who received placebo or were unvaccinated: headache, pyrexia, fatigue, 
 myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, chills, sweats (hyperhidrosis), nausea, abdominal pain, and rash. these 
 systemic aes were usually reported during the first 7 days post vaccination; the majority were of mild to 
 moderate intensity and of short duration (less than 1 week). 
 in the v920-009 trial, solicited systemic aes were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the v920 
 (61.6%) group compared with subjects in the placebo group (43.3%) at any time point. the most 
 frequently (≥10%) reported systemic aes in the v920 and placebo groups were headache, pyrexia, 
 myalgia, and fatigue. other solicited systemic aes reported more commonly reported in the v920 group 
 compared with the placebo group included nausea, arthralgia, and hyperhidrosis. the incidences of other 
 systemic aes including arthropathy, joint stiffness, and joint swelling were comparable between the v920 
 and placebo groups (table 19). 
 in the v920-012 trial, solicited and unsolicited systemic (non-injection-site) aes were reported for 62.3% 
 of subjects in the combined lots group, 68.5% of subjects in the high dose group, and 33.8% of subjects 
 in the placebo group from days 1 to 42. the most frequently (≥10%) reported systemic aes in the 
 combined lots, high dose, and placebo groups were pyrexia, headache, arthralgia, pain, and chills. other 
 systemic aes reported more commonly in any v920 group compared with the placebo group included 
 nausea, fatigue, influenza-like illness, and myalgia (table 19). the majority of these aes were mild to</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 further below. the most frequently reported systemic aes as assessed by the investigator as 
 vaccine-related (&gt;5% in one or more vaccination group) from days 1 to 42 post vaccination were pyrexia, 
 headache, arthralgia, chills, and fatigue. the majority of vaccine-related systemic aes were mild or

 higher risk of arthritis in females.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</header><p>within the clinical development of phase 1 studies, 14 subjects reported saes, and only one</p><p>sae resulted in death after a motor vehicle accident. all saes in the phase 1 studies were not considered to be related 
 to study vaccine. regarding serious adverse events in general, data from all blinded, placebo-controlled 
 clinical trials (v920-001 to -005 as well as -009 and -012) were integrated and compared with placebo. 
 there was a low overall incidence of saes across all trials. in the integrated analysis of blinded trials, saes 
 occurred in 3.4% of all vaccine recipients and 7.8% of placebo recipients through 1 year post vaccination. 
 the constellation of saes in the blinded trials was consistent with conditions commonly observed in the 
 trial population. few saes were considered related to vaccination by investigators in the blinded studies. 
 no v920 recipients discontinued due to saes.</p><p>
 in phase 2/3 studies, regarding deaths, there was no striking incidence of events with a fatal outcome. 
 deaths were generally balanced among vaccine and placebo recipients. none of the deaths were 
 considered vaccine-related by the investigators.</p><p>
 in the v920-009 trial, 11 subjects (1.1%) experienced an ae that resulted in death. overall, the nature 
 and type of fatal aes reported in the v920 group are consistent with events anticipated in the population 
 or a specific demographic, and do not suggest increased risk due to vaccination. 
 in the v920-012 trial, 3 subjects experienced 1 sae each that resulted in death. the events included 
 craniocerebral injury due to a fall, hepatic failure due to alcoholism, and road traffic accident. all of these 
 events, due to extrinsic factors, do not indicate increased risk due to vaccine. 
 in the v920-010 trial, 18 (0.3%) adult vaccinated subjects experienced an sae that resulted in death. 
 evd was the most frequently reported reason for death. it is important to note, however, that all cases of 
 evd reported for subjects randomized to the immediate vaccination group occurred in unvaccinated 
 subjects or in vaccinated subjects prior to 10 days postvaccination. no subject who received study 
 vaccine developed evd 10 or more days following vaccination. none of the deaths in this trial was 
 considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine. 
 in trial v920-011, 19 of 25 subjects (=0.2% of study population) who died had received v920. the 
 proportions of subjects who died were comparable in each vaccination group with 8 deaths in the 
 immediate vaccination group, 6 deaths (including a post-6-month postpartum haemorrhage) in the 
 deferred vaccination group (prior to vaccination), and 11 deaths in the deferred-crossover group (after 
 vaccination), all but one event occurred during the 6-months follow-up each. none of the saes and deaths 
 was considered to be related to study vaccine by the investigator. one subject experienced an event of 
 severe abdominal pain on day 10 postvaccination and died from an unspecified aetiology 8 days later.</p><p>
 regarding other serious adverse events, in the integrated analysis of the blinded phase 1/2/3 studies, 
 the most commonly reported sae from days 1 to 365 for subjects in the v920 group was malaria (1.5% 
 of subjects in the v920 group and 5.6% subjects in the placebo group); all of the saes of malaria were 
 reported in the v920-009 trial. in addition to the v920-009 trial, saes of malaria were reported in the 
 v920-010 trial in guinea and v920-011 trial in sierra leone. in the v920-011 trial, more subjects in the 
 immediate vaccination group reported saes of malaria than subjects in the deferred vaccination and 
 deferred-crossover groups (12 subjects versus 2 subjects in the deferred vaccination group and 3 
 subjects in the deferred-crossover group). the basis for this difference is not clear. however, sierra 
 leone has one of the highest rates of malaria in the world and the diagnosis is frequently made clinically 
 rather than by laboratory confirmation. in the cases of malaria diagnosed without a conclusive diagnostic</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 92/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 laboratory test, it is unclear whether febrile reactions postvaccination may have been given the clinical diagnosis of malaria. in addition, the seasonality of malaria and the different seasons that subjects were 
 vaccinated in the immediate and deferred-crossover groups may partly account for the differences in 
 numbers of cases among the groups. 
 since the time of integration of the sae data described above, sae data from months 6 to 24 post 
 vaccination, the longest time period for saes collected to date in the v920 program, have become 
 available for the v920-012 trial. of the 65 total saes reported from day 1 to month 24 post vaccination, 
 39 saes were reported for 27 subjects from month 6 to month 24 post vaccination. most of these saes 
 were reported as single events by one subject each. three saes with fatal outcome were reported from 
 day 1 to month 24 post vaccination. none of the saes were considered related to study vaccine by the 
 investigator. the integrated sae data were not updated to include the additional sae data from the 
 v920-012 trial as only 7 subjects experienced saes from months 6 to 12 post vaccination. 
 in the v920-010 trial, 80 subjects experienced saes, including 65 vaccinated subjects (61 adults and 4 
 children). the most common diagnosis was evd in 39 (48.7%) of 80 subjects. one sae of febrile reaction 
 in one subject and one sae of anaphylaxis in another subject, which resolved without sequelae, were 
 judged by the investigator and sponsor (the who) to be related to vaccination, and one sae of 
 influenza-like illness, which also recovered without sequelae, was considered possibly-related.</p></section><section><header>evaluation of arthritis adverse events</header><p>joint-related aes occurred more commonly in v920 recipients compared with placebo recipients across the v920 clinical program. adverse events of arthralgia were reported for 10% to 50% of subjects, and 
 arthritis was less commonly reported (&lt;5% in most trials but up to 24% in the v920-005 trial). the 
 majority of joint events were mild to moderate in intensity. arthralgia was generally reported in the first 
 few days following vaccination and resolved within one week after onset, whereas arthritis was generally 
 reported within the first few weeks following vaccination and resolved within several days to weeks after 
 onset. some subjects experienced severe events or recurrent or prolonged joint symptoms lasting up to 
 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up to date. in a small number of subjects, vaccine virus 
 was recovered from joint effusion samples as a possible hint for a virally mediated process. arthralgia, as 
 described for systemic aes in the v920-012 trial, was very commonly observed in the first few days 
 following vaccination, whereas arthritis was observed less commonly in most trials. 
 in the v920-009 trial, the verbatim term “arthritis” was not solicited and “arthritis” was not reported as 
 an unsolicited ae. however, the terms arthropathy, joint stiffness, and joint swelling which align with the 
 definitions of arthritis applied in the v920-004 and v920-005 trials were captured. joint complaints other 
 than arthralgia were reported for a few subjects in the v920-009 trial and the events were comparable in 
 the v920 and placebo groups: arthropathy (3 subjects in the v920 group, 1 subject in the placebo group), 
 joint stiffness (2 subjects in the v920 group, 1 subject in the placebo group), and joint swelling (2 
 subjects in the v920 group, 2 subjects in the placebo group).</p><p>
 in the v920-012 trial, arthritis was solicited based upon the early results from v920-005. the incidences 
 of arthritis (composite term: including meddra preferred terms (pt) of arthritis, monoarthritis, 
 polyarthritis, osteoarthritis, joint swelling, or joint effusion) from days 5 to 42 were 3.7% and 3.1% for 
 subjects in the combined lots and high dose groups, respectively. no subjects in the placebo group 
 experienced arthritis. the following meddra pt events constituted the composite arthritis events:</p><p> 
 •</p><p>arthritis: 1.0% and 0.4% in the combined lots and high dose groups, respectively 
 •</p><p>joint effusion: 0.4% in the high dose group 
 •</p><p>joint swelling: 2.5% and 2.7% in the combined lots high dose groups, respectively 
 •</p><p>osteoarthritis: 0.1% in the combined lots group</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>

 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 • polyarthritis: 0.1% in the combined lots group 
 in the v920-012 trial, a post-hoc multivariate logistic regression analysis that controlled for covariates 
 demonstrated that female sex and a positive medical history of arthritis were independent baseline 
 variables that are associated with a 2.2- to 2.8-higher risk of developing post vaccination arthritis, 
 respectively, with 95% ci lower bounds of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively.</p><p>
 in contrast with other trials, arthritis was reported by a higher (23.5%) proportion of v920 recipients in 
 the v920-p005 trial for reasons that have not been elucidated. half of the subjects with arthritis among 
 vaccinees reported grade 3 severity of symptoms, and 6 subjects reported recurrent or persistent joint 
 symptoms up to 2 years post vaccination.</p></section><section><header>evaluation of skin and mucosal adverse events</header><p>in the v920 clinical program, certain skin- and mucosal-related aes were observed in subjects following vaccination. these events generally occurred at a low incidence, were mild to moderate in intensity, and 
 were self-limited. across the v920 program, vesicular lesions of the skin (blisters) appearing in the first 
 few weeks after vaccination were reported in some of subjects. in addition, some subjects vaccinated 
 with v920 experienced oral ulcers. a small number of rashes including vesicular lesions of the skin were 
 positive for v920 vaccine virus by rt-pcr testing, suggesting that both post vaccination rash and vesicles 
 may be virally mediated. the assessment of vaccine virus in oral ulcers by rt-pcr was not conducted. 
 the majority of data for the analyses of skin and mucosal events for the phase 1 clinical program are from 
 the v920-004 and v920-005 trials, as these trials have the most comprehensive and representative data 
 pertaining to these events.</p><p>
 in the v920-004 analysis, a comprehensive analysis of temporally-associated post-vaccination dermatitis 
 was performed; this term was defined as a solicited ae preferred term of mucosal lesions or skin lesions, 
 or unsolicited ae preferred term of dermatitis, petechiae, rash (including generalized, macular, papular, 
 or vesicular rash), skin lesion, skin mass, or skin ulcer with onset within 56 days of vaccination; however, 
 symptoms of dermatitis were captured differently across cohorts. in the v920-005 trial, skin- and 
 mucosal-related aes were defined by the solicited term of skin lesions and unsolicited terms of rash 
 (including erythematous, generalized, macular, maculo-papular, papular, and vesicular rash), mouth 
 ulceration, papule, and cutaneous vasculitis. 
 in addition to the v920-004 and v920-005 analyses, a comprehensive analysis for rash aes was 
 presented for the v920-012 trial. in order to capture all possible cases of rash in the v920 012 trial, the 
 following preferred terms were defined before database lock based on review of blinded safety data and 
 included in the composite term for rash: petechiae, purpura, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash 
 papular and rash vesicular. 
 in the v920-009 trial, rash was a solicited ae, and was reported in 3.6% of v920 recipients and 3.2% of 
 placebo recipients. mouth ulceration was reported for 2.6% of subjects in both the v920 and placebo 
 groups. 
 in the v920-012 trial, rash and vesicular lesions were solicited aes. the proportions of subjects with rash 
 (composite term: meddra pt petechiae, purpura, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash papular, and 
 rash vesicular) from days 1 to 42 post vaccination were low – for the combined lots (3.8%), high dose 
 (3.8%), and placebo (1.5%) groups. the proportions of subjects with vesicular lesions from days 1 to 42 
 post vaccination similarly were low – for the combined lots (1.5%), high dose (1.5%), and placebo 
 (0.0%) groups. an assessment algorithm for subjects who reported aes of rash and vesicular lesions 
 involved referrals to a dermatologist for skin events and/or biopsy/fluid sampling to identify v920 via 
 rt-pcr, if feasible. however in this trial, of 6 subjects with skin aes, rt-pcr results identified v920 from</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 94/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 a biopsy in only 1 subject with an ae of dermatitis. rt-pcr results were positive for v920 in the vesicular fluid of 1 subject with blisters tested. 
 in the v920-005 trial, there is a heterogeneous picture regarding rash and vesical events in vaccinated 
 and placebo subjects: 29.4% of all v920 recipients and 30.8% of placebo subjects experienced skin- and 
 mucosal-related aes. the most frequently reported skin- and mucosal-related ae was mouth ulceration, 
 with 15.7% of subjects in the v920 group compared with 23.1% of subjects in the placebo group. rash 
 was reported for 4.9% of v920 recipients and 7.7% of placebo recipients. two subjects experienced aes 
 assessed by the investigator to be cutaneous vasculitis. review of clinical and histologic evidence in each 
 case of reported cutaneous vasculitis by external experts determined that a systemic vasculitis process is 
 not favoured. in both cases, the evidence suggested hypersensitivity reaction, and in one, post-viral 
 exanthem.</p></section><section><header>hypersensitivity events</header><p>only one subject had an sae of anaphylaxis, in the v920-010 trial, that was considered to be vaccine-related by the investigator and trial sponsor. this subject developed generalized pruritus, 
 urticaria, and oedema of the face and lips approximately 12 hours after vaccination. the subject 
 presented the following day, was treated with steroids, and improved without hospitalization.</p></section><section><header>overdose</header><p>there were no reports of overdose in the v920 trials. all v920 trials administered a single dose of v920, except for the v920 002 trial in which 2 doses were administered. the majority of subjects enrolled in the 
 v920 trials received a single dose with the exception of 6 subjects in the v920-011 trial who were 
 unintentionally vaccinated twice after attempting to enrol multiple times at several trial locations. the 
 median time between vaccinations was 48 days (range: 27 to 98 days). all 6 subjects were followed for 
 6 months following the second dose of v920 and no vaccine-related saes were reported.</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>laboratory assessments were routinely collected in the phase 1 and the v920-009 trials. decreases in white blood cell (wbc), lymphocyte, and neutrophil count were reported in a higher proportion of v920 
 recipients compared with placebo recipients. decreases in white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil 
 count were reported commonly after vaccination with a viral vaccine. 
 the events were transient, occurring a few days following vaccinations and were in toxicity grades 1-2. 
 there were no associated infections reported for subjects who experienced aes associated with 
 hematologic abnormalities, and these events were not considered clinically significant, although 
 theoretically can be associated with a higher risk of infection during the period of depletion.</p><p>in the v920-012 trial, a total of 72 subjects who experienced arthritis, arthralgia, or rash had occasional 
 laboratory testing conducted. mild elevations of c-reactive protein (crp) were noted in 17 out of 54 
 subjects. mild to moderate elevations of alt were also noted in 6 subjects out of 39 subjects who had 
 additional crp testing, both hinting to a mild inflammatory sign.</p></section><section><header>vaccine viremia and viral shedding</header><p>vaccine viremia evaluation and viral shedding was investigated in the context of the era. v920 vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine that is replication competent.</p><p>shedding of v920 has been observed in urine 
 and saliva of &lt;10% adult subjects and identified in vesicles. transmission of v920 through close personal 
 contact is considered as a theoretical possibility. 
 in the phase 1 clinical program, subjects in the blinded and open-label trials were assessed for vaccine 
 viremia (detection of the v920 in the blood) and viral shedding of v920 post-vaccination using real-time</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assays. the time points for pcr testing varied by trial. the assay methodology is described in the efficacy section. 
 the qualitative results (positive or negative for vaccine viremia) were presented for subjects who received 
 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 or higher for the phase 1 trials, with the limitation that the sensitivities of the assays for detection of vaccine viremia are different and cannot be compared. the rt-pcr assay methods 
 were not standardized across the trials and used different qualitative and quantitative definitions for 
 detection of vaccine viremia.</p><p>
 all subjects who received 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose of v920 or higher in the v920-001, v920-002, and v920-005 trials had detectable vaccine viremia at some time point following vaccination. the proportions of subjects 
 with vaccine viremia decreased over time, and all vaccine viremia resolved by day 14 post-vaccination in 
 the v920-001 and v920-005 trials. for the v920-002 trial, 3 subjects (30.0%) each in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose v920 groups still had detectable vaccine viremia at day 7 post-vaccination, with no other time points tested in this trial. the v920-004 trial had the highest number 
 of subjects (n = 408) tested for vaccine viremia, and of these subjects, 80 (20%) had detectable viremia 
 at 1 or more time points following vaccination. in this trial, a similar number of subjects had rt-pcr 
 testing performed in both the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose v920 groups, but a higher proportion of subjects (62.2%) who received the 1 × 10
 8 pfu/dose v920 had vaccine viremia compared with subjects (21.7%) who received the 2 × 10
 7 pfu dose. in 2 × 107 pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose v920 groups, the incidence of viremia peaked on days 1 and 2 post-vaccination respectively; all vaccine viremia for 
 subjects in these v920 dose groups resolved by day 28 post-vaccination.</p><p>
 in the v920 phase 1 open-label trials, all adult subjects in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group of the phase 1 open-label trials had detectable vaccine viremia at some time. on day 1, the proportions of subjects 
 with vaccine viremia were 90.0%, 100.0%, and 86.7% in the v920-006, v920-007, and v920-008 trials, 
 respectively. by day 3 post-vaccination in the v920-006 and v920-008 trials, all subjects had detectable 
 vaccine viremia. the proportions of subjects in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group with vaccine viremia decreased over time; all cases of subjects in this group resolved by day 6 and day 7 post-vaccination in 
 the v920-006 and v920-008 trials. for the v920-007 trial, 3 adult subjects (18.8%) in the 2 × 10
 7 pfu/dose v920 group still had detectable vaccine viremia at day 7 post-vaccination, with no later time points tested in this trial. 
 in summary, vaccine viremia was commonly observed among adults vaccinated with v920, but generally 
 resolved by day 14 post-vaccination. the v920 phase 2 and 3 trials did not assess vaccine viremia and 
 viral shedding. 
 viral shedding (identification of the v920 virus in saliva and urine) was seen in a few adult subjects at low 
 copy number. shedding might also possibly occur via other body fluids than saliva or urine, such as 
 semen, sweat, vesicular liquid, breastmilk, aerosol, vomit. in trial v920-012, rt-pcr evaluation on 
 vesicular lesions for 2 subjects was negative, and on blisters for 1 subject was positive (687,160 
 copies/ml). a viral shedding assessment was not performed for all subjects in the v920-005 trial. per 
 protocol, the shedding assessment was stopped after the first 10 subjects because all results were 
 negative. although transmission of the virus through close personal contact is a theoretical possibility, it 
 is considered low risk, because of the low magnitude of shedding observed.</p><p>
 secondary transmission of v920 was not evaluated in the v920 program.</p></section><section><header>safety in paediatric population</header><p>in the v920-007 trial, 20 school-age children and 20 adolescents were enrolled and vaccinated. two adolescents (5.0%) withdrew early from the trial; one of the adolescents withdrew consent within 14 days</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 following vaccination. the mean age of school-age children was 9.2 years (range: 7 to 11 years) and of adolescents was 14.7 years (range: 13 to 17 years). 
 in the first 14 days following vaccination, solicited local aes were reported in 7 school-age children (35%) 
 and in 5 adolescents (25%); these incidence rates were comparable to those in adult subjects who 
 received 2×107 pfu (9 subjects, 56%). solicited systemic aes were reported in 17 school-age children 
 (85%) and in 19 adolescents (95%); in comparison, solicited systemic aes were reported in 13 (81%) 
 adult subjects who received 2×107 pfu. 
 the majority of the solicited local teaes had an early onset, i.e. in the first day following vaccination, and 
 all solicited teaes were assessed as grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. 
 most solicited local and systemic aes abated within 3 days (median duration ≤3 days), but the median 
 duration for decreased appetite was 4.5 days. one school-age child had diarrhoea for 6 days, and 1 
 adolescent had injection site swelling that lasted 9 days. arthralgia was the only solicited teae that lasted 
 ≥14 days, with a maximum duration of 16 days in 1 adolescent. 
 in the non-randomized arm of the v920-010 ring vaccination trial, there have also 194 children between 
 6 - 17 years been regarding included children in the non-randomized arm, overall, 38.2% of 194 
 vaccinated children reported a solicited ae from days 0 to 14 following vaccination. solicited injection-site 
 pain was reported for 5% of these subjects. the most commonly reported solicited systemic aes were 
 headache, fatigue, muscle pain, myalgia, and arthralgia. most of the solicited aes reported for children 
 were mild in intensity.</p><p>
 two children had temperatures ≥38
 oc, and aes of fever were reported accordingly; however, the intensity of these events was not assessed. 
 overall, the median duration of solicited aes with any intensity (mild, moderate, severe) reported for 
 children was 2 days (iqr: 1 to 3 days). only one child reported a severe ae of fatigue, which had a 
 duration of 4 days. 
 an amendment to expanded access protocol 5 (eap5; a compassionate ring vaccination study to evaluate 
 the safety of the ebola vaccine in the democratic republic of the congo) to include pregnant women (after 
 the first trimester) and infants ≥6 months was approved in june 2019, and vaccinations in these 
 populations began on 13 june 2019. under this protocol amendment, vaccinated pregnant women and 
 children (6 to 11 months of age) will be actively monitored for aes by the trial sponsor through 21 days 
 post-vaccination. vaccinated pregnant women will also be followed until the end of pregnancy to assess 
 the clinical status of the newborn. once the outbreak has concluded and the database for eap5 is cleaned 
 and locked, an analysis of the impact of v920 in this outbreak will be prepared, which will include an 
 evaluation of safety and efficacy. the applicant is requested to share the safety data once the trial is

 incidentally found to be pregnant after vaccination and the pregnancy outcomes were reported. among 
 the trials with available data, the majority of pregnancies occurred in the v920-011 trial. pregnancies 
 reported with onset within 2 months after enrolment or vaccinations were followed to resolution. a total 
 of 261 pregnancies were reported during the trial. of these pregnancies, 107 pregnancies were reported 
 as occurring within 2 months after enrolment or vaccination: 58 resulted in live births (55 full term and 3 
 pre-term), 30 early pregnancy losses, and 9 still births ≥20 weeks of gestation. 
 regarding early pregnancy losses, their rate has been shown 3-fold higher in the v920 vaccinees 
 compared to the deferred control group. data are not sufficient to draw any conclusion at this stage. lack 
 of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also 
 makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging.</p><p>
 no data is available for subjects who were breastfeeding in the v920 clinical program. 
 immunocompromised subjects 
 the safety of v920 has not been assessed in severely immunocompromised individuals. in individuals 
 with a defect in innate or adaptive immunity, the live-replicating vaccine could theoretically produce a 
 more active or long-lasting infection with the vaccine virus than normal, the outcome of which could be a 
 severe illness. it is not known what effects v920 may have on individuals with the following conditions: 
 •</p><p>severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined 
 immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and aids or symptomatic hiv infection. a cd4+

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>phase i trials eight phase 1 trials were conducted (v920-001, -002, -003, -004, -005, -06, -007, and -008) in the us 
 and canada, europe (switzerland and germany), and regions of africa not affected by the outbreak 
 (gabon and kenya). the phase 1 program included 795 adult subjects who received v920 as a single dose 
 ranging from 3 × 10
 3 pfu/dose to 1 × 108 pfu/dose, whereas 197 adult subjects who received a single dose of 2 × 10
 7 pfu or higher of v920. 30 subjects received dosages 3x106 pfu, 1x107 pfu, or 1x108 pfu compared to placebo twice. 135 subjects received placebo in the phase 1 blinded trials. 
 the incidence of reported solicited aes was higher in the v920 dose groups compared to placebo. solicited 
 local aes were reported more frequently with increasing dosages. after the second dosage, less aes were 
 reported compared to the first administration. unsolicited aes associated with laboratory abnormalities 
 were more often reported from subjects vaccinated with v920 compared to placebo. 
 within the blinded phase i trials a heterogeneous reporting rate of 15% to 50% for arthralgia was 
 observed. reporting of arthralgia was not dosage dependent but occurred more frequently in v920 
 recipients as compared to placebo recipients. because of this reporting the event of arthralgia should be 
 followed up in the psur. 
 myalgia, objective fever, and subjective fever were reported with a higher incidence in the v920 groups 
 compared to placebo groups but showing no clear dose-dependent trend.</p><p>
 solicited injection-site ae was most commonly reported in all phase i trials. solicited and unsolicited ae 
 were mostly considered as grade 1 or grade 2 and were abated within 3 days. 
 the majority of data for the analyses of skin and mucosal events for the phase 1 clinical program are from 
 the v920-004 and v920-005 trials, as these trials have the most comprehensive and representative data 
 pertaining to these events.</p><p>
 rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%), 
 dermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical trials. in 6 out of 18 subjects tested, v920</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 virus was detected in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process post-vaccination.</p><p>
 vaccine viremia (based upon rna detection) was commonly observed among adults vaccinated in the 
 phase 1 trials but generally resolved by day 14 post-vaccination. the v920 phase 2 and 3 trials did not 
 assess vaccine viremia and viral shedding. viremia was more often detected after administration of both 
 higher dose groups, i.e.</p><p>2x10
 7pfu and 1x108pfu compared to 3x106 pfu and in children compared to adults. it appears to be less common after day 3 post-vaccination and is rarely found at 7 or 14 days. 
 shedding of v920 has been observed in urine and saliva at low incidence and low copy number in adult 
 subjects (&lt;1000 copies/ml) and identified in vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult patients. viral shedding was of 
 higher magnitude and more frequent in children and adolescents compared to adults. transmission risk is 
 considered very low. this theoretical safety concern has been adequately addressed in the section 4.4 of 
 the smpc. as a precaution, subject should avoid close association with and exposure of high-risk 
 individuals to blood and bodily fluids for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. individuals who develop 
 vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. 
 transient decreases in in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells have also been 
 observed, but no increased risk of infection has been reported. those events could be theoretically 
 associated to a higher risk of infection during the period of depletion. the mechanism leading to this 
 variation in the white blood count is poorly understood. the applicant is requested to follow up in psurs 
 on any additional data will be collected from completed and ongoing trials to document and/or explain the 
 transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells after vaccination and 
 their repercussions for the safety of vaccinees.</p><p>
 v920-007 was the first trial to evaluated safety in 20 schoolchildren and 20 adolescents. vaccination with 
 v920 was tolerated well in both age groups with comparable ae reporting and the incidences of solicited 
 symptoms were comparable to the frequencies reported by adults in the phase i trials. 
 phase 2/3 clinical trials 
 the total number of adult subjects vaccinated with v920 in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 
 2,171 and in open label trials was 13,826. a total of 15,398 subjects received the ≥2
 ×107 pfu dose and 15,050 participants had the exact dose of2x10
 7 pfu; the blinded placebo-controlled studies incorporated 1,712 vaccinated with ≥2x10
 7 pfu. of these, 1,397 adults had the intended dose of 2x107 pfu. the phase 2/3 placebo-controlled randomized trials (protocol 009 and protocol 012) included 498 african subjects of 
 liberia and 1,061 subjects in us, spain and canada.</p><p>
 the frequencies listed in the smpc are based on the higher frequency reported in either of the phase 2/3 
 placebo-controlled randomized trials, protocol 009 and protocol 012.</p><p>
 the most commonly reported solicited systemic aes in all the phase 2 and 3 trials were headache, 
 pyrexia, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia and these types of aes were also consistent with those 
 commonly reported (≥4 subjects in one or more vaccination groups) in the v920-012 trial, which was 
 conducted in north-america and europe. the increased frequency of the reports of headache, pyrexia, 
 fatigue, and myalgia in the v920-009 trial compared with the v920-012 trial may be explained by the 
 events being solicited in the former trial only. arthralgia (or joint pain), which was solicited in both trials, 
 was more frequently reported in v920-012 than v920-009. the extremely low report of pyrexia in the 
 v920-010 trial is likely confounded by the provision of antipyretics to the subjects in this trial. subjects 
 were provided acetaminophen or ibuprofen at the time of vaccination. the increased frequency of 
 reporting of all the solicited aes in the v920-011 trial may be due to the open-label nature of the trial 
 (compared with v920-009 and v920-012), and perhaps increased reporting of these events among 
 subjects who were not affected by the ebola outbreak compared with subjects in v920-010. the 
 v920-011 trial also provided a diary card to subjects for the recording of post-vaccination events.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the v920 trials were designed and conducted by various sponsors, which led to heterogeneous study designs that did not prove conducive for integrating ae data. as a result of the differences, the ae 
 datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated to provide a meaningful and interpretable 
 integrated dataset, which is acceptable given the context. an assessment of aes or saes from the 
 double-blind trials versus the open-label trials is not meaningful because the study vaccine that the 
 subject received in the open-label trials was known by all and therefore, the assessment of aes and saes 
 in the open-label trials lacks objectivity due to reporting bias. therefore, to preserve the integrity of the 
 sae analysis for v920 administered at the 2 × 10
 7 pfu dose, only the saes from the double-blind trials were integrated. for a comprehensive evaluation of saes in the v920 clinical program, saes from all 
 trials, including the open-label trials, were also summarized and the results are clinically meaningful 
 without data integration. 
 arthritis is an ae of special interest and therefore, events of arthritis were assessed in all phase 2 and 3 
 clinical trials. the proportions of subjects who reported arthritis in the v920-009 and v920-010 trials were 
 very low (only 2 subjects [0.4%] in v920-009 and none in v920-010). as noted, arthritis was not solicited 
 in the v920-010 trial, and only a subset of subjects (201) were interviewed regarding joint symptoms at 
 week 2 post-vaccination in the v920-009 trial. both factors may have impacted the reporting of arthritis 
 aes. in the v920-011 and v920-012 trials, in which arthritis was a solicited systemic ae, the proportions 
 of subjects who reported this event were comparable (3.2% and 3.7%, respectively). oligo-arthritis and 
 rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence and are most of the times mild-moderate in 
 severity and self-limited. less than 5% of subjects in most trials (including pivotal phase 3 safety study 
 012 with specific surveillance for joint and skin adverse events) experienced arthritis and/or rash, which 
 in some cases may be vesicular or purpuric. in some cases, viral rna has been identified by 
 immunohistochemistry and/or rt-pcr in the joints or skin/vesicles. in one phase 1 study the incidence of 
 oligoarthritis was as high as 22%. the reason for this difference is not well understood. in an open label 
 safety study in sierra leone (011-strive), 17% complained of joint pains in the interval 5-28 days after 
 vaccination. the arthritis and skin events appear to reflect direct viral injury and inflammation and do not 
 have an immunopathological basis which could suggest an autoimmune disease. a subset of subjects in 
 005 and 012 continued to have persistent joint symptoms at the completion of the study (follow-up was 
 up to 2 years). the 005 also reported several subjects with recurrent joint events following initial 
 resolution of the events. this current study did not specifically analyse recurrences of joint events.</p><p>
 the risk of shedding via fluids in vesicles is considered very low in healthy people in line with the results 
 from phase i studies but has not been investigated in immunocompromised patients. the risk of shedding 
 via saliva or urine is considered low. transmission of v920 through close personal contact is accepted as 
 a theoretical possibility. as a precaution, vaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure 
 of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. high-risk 
 individuals include: 
 •</p><p>immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see 
 section above),</p><p>
 •</p><p>pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6), 
 •</p><p>children &lt;1 year of age. 
 individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal 
 to minimize the risk of possible transmission of v920 through open vesicles. for the same reason, 
 individuals administered v920 should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination. 
 as there are no data on co-administration of v920 with other vaccines, the concomitant use of v920 with 
 other vaccines is not recommended.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 non-intramuscular administration errors can lead to adverse events and delayed absorption in general as the subcutaneous space is less vascular. administration of v920 is intended for intramuscular 
 administration; there is no data on subcutaneous administration and subcutaneous administration is not 
 recommended.</p><p>
 there is currently limited evidence related to the safety of v920 during pregnancy in humans. pregnant 
 women were excluded from clinical trials. however, a total of 261 women were incidentally found to be 
 pregnant after vaccination. although administration of v920 (5.28 x 10
 7 pfu/animal) showed no effect in rats studies on mating, fertility, or foetal development following either single or multiple doses, the risk of 
 adverse effects from administering the live virus vaccine to pregnant women remains unknown given the 
 limited amount of clinical data available. lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and 
 neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging. 
 however, more data will be available post-authorisation from the ring vaccination trial that is ongoing in 
 drc at the moment. 
 severely immunocompromised subjects were excluded from v920 clinical trials. the largest number of 
 hiv-positive individuals (with unknown immune compromise status) were enrolled in the v920-009 trial 
 and exposed to v920. these subjects had a consistent safety profile compared with hiv-negative 
 individuals, although the small numbers limit the conclusions that may be drawn. 
 the following safety topics should be considered as risk of the product to be discussed in the psur: 
 • arthritis: the frequency of arthritis in vaccinees may vary according to factors such as gender, age, and personal and/or family history of this condition. the frequency of long-lasting arthritis after 
 vaccination is poorly known as well as the frequency of disabilities associated with the condition. new 
 data related to arthritis should be discussed through the psurs. 
 •</p><p>‘hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis)’ is considered a rare but severe adverse reaction following vaccination.</p><p>
 • ‘risk of infection due to transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells
 ’: those are theoretically associated to a higher risk of infection during the period of depletion. the mechanism leading to this variation in the white blood count is poorly understood. 
 based on a limited number of observations, no increased incidence of infectious episodes was 
 observed after vaccination. yet, more evidence is required to fully characterise the risk.</p><p>
 • behavioural changes regarding usage of other preventative ebola preventative measures: this concern in addressed in the smpc and pl, section 4.4. however, any indication of preventable 
 exposure should be explored when reviewing breakthrough cases. any relevant publication should be 
 discussed.</p><p> 
 • safety and reduced efficacy in immunocompromised hosts: information is missing for this group which was not part of the clinical development plan.</p><p>• cases of post-exposure prophylaxis (pep): given the nature of the vaccine and the contexts of its use, it is likely that the vaccine will be used in pep. the knowledge on the use of the vaccine in pep is very

 conclusions on the clinical safety</header><p>the safety of ervebo was assessed based on data collected in 15.398 healthy adults receiving ≥2x107 pfu in 8 phase 1 studies and 4 phase 2/3 studies. the chosen dosage of 2 x 10
 7 pfu v920 was well tolerated by the enrolled subjects. the trials were not designed or conducted by the various sponsors with the final 
 objective of data integration among them. the datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated 
 to provide a meaningful and interpretable integrated dataset. the integrated safety database consists of 
 only serious adverse events (saes) data from 7 double-blinded studies (phase 1 studies v920-001, 
 v920-002, v920-003, v920-004, v920-005 phase 2/3 studies, v920-009, and v920-012). saes data 
 across the randomized blinded trials were more uniformly collected and thus data integration was 
 feasible.</p><p>
 a review of disposition and demographic data for subjects who received v920 at a dose of 2 × 10
 7 pfu or higher demonstrated a comparable profile from all v920 doses combined except for the aesis discussed 
 (e.g. arthritis and rash). 
 the most common injection-site adverse reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%) 
 and erythema (13.7%). the most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination 
 with ervebo were headache (36.9%), pyrexia (34.3%), myalgia (32.5%), fatigue (18.5%), arthralgia 
 (17.1%), nausea (8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and 
 abdominal pain (1.4%). in general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were 
 mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). arthralgia was generally 
 reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within 
 one week after onset. 
 in 2015, a safety signal was reported in a phase 1 study regarding aes arthritis and joint problems and 
 skin rashes. arthritis (arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling, osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) 
 was generally reported within the first few weeks following vaccination. occurrence of arthritis in 
 v920-005 was 24/102 (23.5%: very common) as compared to v920-012 results of 29/791 (3.7%: 
 common). the majority of arthritis reactions were mild to moderate and generally resolved within several 
 days to weeks after onset. few subjects experienced severe reactions or recurrent or prolonged joint 
 symptoms lasting up to 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up period. in a small number of 
 subjects, the vaccine virus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally mediated 
 process post-vaccination. the results of phase 3 study v920-012 show that female sex and a positive 
 medical history of arthritis have statistically significant associations in multivariate analyses of composite 
 arthritis terms with a 2.2- to 2.8-fold higher risk of post-vaccination arthritis and 95% confidence interval 
 (ci) lower bounds of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively. 
 rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash, dermatitis, vesicular rash or 
 cutaneous vasculitis. in a small number of subjects, the vaccine virus was detected in rashes (described 
 as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process

 a total of 261 women were incidentally found to be pregnant after vaccination but this data is too limited

 536 (8.4%) of eligible, consented subjects were ≥65 years of age in the v920-010 trial, making the safety 
 dataset in this population limited. although it is not expected that the safety will differ in subject &gt;65 
 years of age compared to younger subjects, as a precaution this limitation of the trials has been reflected 
 as a warning in the smpc.

 disease or condition</header><p>ebola virus disease (evd) is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by ebola filovirus with case fatality ranging from 30% to 90% and an incubation period of 2 to 21 days. the disease-to-infection ratio 
 is generally described as being 1:1 but some evd asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infections are 
 increasingly described. the highest case fatality has historically been observed with zaire ebola virus 
 (70%), the virus causing the 2014 outbreak in west africa.</p><p>
 the pathogenesis of evd is characterized by an intense inflammatory process, impaired haemostasis and 
 capillary leaks, with mortality resulting from septic shock and multi-organ system failure. initial signs and 
 symptoms are nonspecific (fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue) and may mimic other more common 
 conditions such as malaria. after one week, haemorrhagic manifestations can appear in more than half of 
 the patients. evd progresses with gastrointestinal symptoms, internal and external bleeding, and in some 
 cases, rash and neurologic involvement. the varying spectrum of ebola virus disease severity, and the 
 presence of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases, is increasingly acknowledged.</p><p>
 fruit bats, often hunted for food such as hypsignatus genus, are considered the reservoir for ebola and 
 marburg filoviruses. however, this could only be confirmed for marburg and the precise reservoir for ebola 
 virus remains unknown. close contact with infected animals in the rainforest, often used as ‘bushmeat’ 
 such as antelope or monkeys, is a likely route of transmission. twenty-five evd outbreaks have been 
 recorded so far. the largest outbreak before the 2014 outbreak was in uganda in 2000 to 2001, with 425 
 cases. in more than half of outbreaks, the animal origin of the virus could not be shown.</p><p>
 pregnant women face high mortality and a high risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. 
 ebola virus disease (evd) is caused by infection with a filovirus of the ebolavirus genus which includes five 
 distinct species. zaire, sudan, bundibugyo and taï forest ebolaviruses occur in africa and cause serious 
 illness in humans. reston ebolavirus occurs in the philippines and only causes asymptomatic illness in 
 human. the first three, bundibugyo ebolavirus, zaire ebolavirus, and sudan ebolavirus have been 
 associated with large outbreaks in africa. the virus causing the 2014–2016 west african outbreak 
 belongs to the zaire ebolavirus species. although the ebolavirus species associated with the current 
 outbreak in the drc is the same species that caused the earlier outbreak (zaire ebolavirus), genetic 
 differences between the viruses suggest the two outbreaks are not linked. 
 ebola viruses are highly transmissible by direct contact of a healthy person’s broken skin or mucous 
 membranes with organs, blood or other bodily fluids (e.g. urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, 
 and semen) of living or dead infected persons, any soiled material (e.g. soiled clothing, bed linen, gloves, 
 protective equipment and medical waste), or semen from men who recovered from evd. most cases are 
 caused by human to human transmission. the risk of transmission from contaminated surfaces is low and 
 can be reduced even further by appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures.</p><p>
 the virus can persist in immunologically privileged sites such as semen, breast milk, ocular (eye) fluid, 
 and spinal column fluid of recovered patients. the exact duration of persistence and the magnitude of risk 
 of transmission through survivors is currently unknown, but some body fluids have tested positive by 
 rt-pcr for longer than 9 months.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>no treatment or vaccine is currently authorised for ebola virus disease in the eu, but several investigational vaccines and treatments based on blood, immunological or antiviral therapies are in 
 clinical development or recommended for emergency use. 
 the additional most promising vaccine under development is the 2-dose ad26-zebov/mva-bn-filo 
 heterologous vaccine regimen developed by janssen. two ebola vaccines were authorised for national use 
 only in russia and china in 2017, but limited information is available on clinical data. 
 regarding therapeutics, preliminary data from the ongoing palm trial in drc showed that rgn-eb3 and 
 mab114 seem more promising among four investigational agents (zmapp, remdesivir, mab114 and 
 regn-eb3). for details of other investigative products see section 2.1.5. 
 early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival, however based on 
 limited data available from 27 patients treated in us and eu hospital still almost 20% of them died.</p><p>
 prevention of evd is currently accomplished through education on avoidance of risk factors, quarantine of 
 infected individuals and the use of personnel protective equipment (ppe). 
 given the lack of specific treatment currently available and the fact that evd is a highly infectious disease 
 associated with a high mortality rate (25 to 90%), there is clearly an urgent unmet medical need.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.  
 main clinical studies</header><p>the main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase iii multicentre, cluster-randomized, open-label study comparing 1 dose (≥2x10
 7 pfu) of v920 administered in immediate (d0) vaccination (n=4539, 51 clusters) vs. v920 administered in delayed (d21) vaccination (n=4557, 47 clusters) in adults defined as 
 contacts or contacts-of-contacts around a confirmed ebola index case, as well as children ≥6yoa enrolled 
 in later stages of the trial. the trial was conducted in guinea and sierra leone between march 2015 and 
 january 2016 towards the end of the outbreak. 
 the objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy in the prevention of evd caused by ebola zaire virus 
 by comparing immediate versus delayed ring vaccination. 
 the ring vaccination strategy increased the possibility of the study to yield robust data on the efficacy of 
 the vaccine despite the low and declining incidence of evd by involving small pockets of high-risk 
 individuals with high evd incidence. it has also proven to be effective in outbreak management of 
 infectious diseases with relatively low reproduction number (r0, i.e. the number of cases one case 
 generates on average over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population), as 
 is the case for ebola zaire (r0 of 1.5-2.5, compared to r0 of 2-5 for hiv and r0 of 12-18 for measles). 
 the main evidence of immunogenicity submitted is derived from eight phase 1 dose-finding studies, and 
 from two phase 2 and 3 trials conducted during the time of the 2014 to 2016 ebola outbreak in at-risk 
 populations in liberia (v920-009) and sierra leone (v920-011) as well as in populations not at risk in us, 
 canada and spain (v920-012). in all 3 trials, immune responses after a single nominal dose of 2 × 10
 7 pfu v920 were measured up until month 12 (v920-009 and v920-011) or month 24 (v920-012) 
 post-vaccination in terms of anti-gp antibodies (gp-elisa) and neutralizing antibodies (prnt) with 
 validated assays.</p></section><section><header n="3.2">3.2.

 estimate is based on 10 evd cases (in 4 rings) identified prior to vaccination in 1,429 subjects of the 
 delayed arm (46 rings) compared to 0 cases in 2,108 vaccinated subjects in the immediate arm (51 
 rings). the secondary analysis to estimate vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed evd among all 
 cccs in the immediate vaccination arm versus all cccs in the delayed vaccination arm resulted in a 
 vaccine efficacy estimate of 64.6% (95% ci: -44.2% to 91.3%) p=0.3761.</p><p>
 after vaccination, there were no evd cases amongst the 5,837 vaccinated individuals in all 117 rings, 10 
 days or more post-vaccination, both randomized (immediate, delayed) and non-randomized, during the 
 study period of 84 days. analysis to assess vaccine efficacy against death from laboratory confirmed evd 
 supports the primary analysis. 
 the seroresponse rate defined as a 2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 eu/ml for gp-elisa (primary 
 endpoint) in a non-endemic population of adults 18-65 years of age was 98.6% (95% ci: 97.4%
 –99.3%) at any time point and 92.1% (95% ci: 88.4%
 –94.9%) at month 24. gp-elisa gmt peaked at day 28 post-vaccination with 1262 eu/ml (95% ci: 1168.9–1362.6) and declined by approximately 25% at 
 month 24 post-vaccination to 920.3 eu/ml (95% ci: 820.4–1032.3). prnt gmt peaked at month 18 
 post-vaccination with 276.9 (95% ci: 248.3–308.9) and remained stable through month 24 
 post-vaccination (v920-012 trial conducted in us, canada, eu). 
 sustained but lower seroresponse rate and gmt were observed in endemic populations. the seroresponse 
 rate defined as a 2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 eu/ml for gp-elisa (primary endpoint) in an 
 endemic population of adults 18-65 yoa was 93.8% (95% ci: 91.1%–95.8.3%) at any time point and 
 80.1% (95% ci: 76.2%–83.7%) at month 12. gp-elisa gmt peaked at day 28 post-vaccination with 
 994.7 eu/ml (95% ci: 915.0–1081.3) and declined by approximately 33% at month 12 post-vaccination 
 to 661.4 eu/ml (95% ci: 613.2–712.4). prnt gmt peaked at day 28 post-vaccination with 116.8 (95% 
 ci: 106.0–128.8) and remained stable through month 12 post-vaccination (v920-009 trial conducted in 
 liberia). 
 the immunogenicity data indicate a robust and sustainable immune response in healthy adults at risk and 
 not at risk of infection through to two years post-vaccination. overall, non-clinical primary 
 pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that v920 induces robust immune responses upon 
 vaccination with a single dose and provides protection after ebov challenge in nhp.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>uncertainties remain as to the actual level of protection, the duration of protection and the type of protection (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis) given the methodological peculiarities of the ring 
 vaccination design and the exceptional circumstances experienced during a declining ebola epidemic. 
 formally, from a statistical perspective the trial was not successful at interim but randomized enrolment 
 was stopped thereafter. as the primary analysis is based on the interim data, the trial hence overall could 
 not demonstrate a statistically significant ve. ve estimates may lack precision as they are based on few 
 cases from a limited number of clusters and the time window for case ascertainment was short. bias on 
 various levels, including possible imbalance between arms with respect to detection, reporting and 
 transmission control measures as well as selection bias at enrolment due to possible unblinding on a 
 larger scale, cannot be excluded. the impact and direction of potential biases cannot be assessed. 
 however, no cases of evd were observed in any subject ≥ 10 days after vaccination, and the clear-cut 
 outcome of the study somehow mitigate potential uncertainties. more data is expected during the 
 post-authorisation phase also from the current ongoing outbreak in drc where the vaccine was deployed.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the exact duration of protection by a single im administration of ervebo in humans is currently not known. the ring trial had only a study period of 84 days. loss of protection in the longer term after vaccination 
 was suggested by a nhp study. given the gap of knowledge about specific mechanism of protection and 
 protective titres, it is uncertain whether the duration of protection associated with v920 can be deduced 
 from immunogenicity data only. need for and timing of a booster dose is currently not known. 
 considering the ebola incubation time of up to 21 days (even if most infections become symptomatic in 
 8-10 days), ring vaccination by design might have included both pre-and post-exposure vaccination. it 
 might well be that the ve data have been gathered in a mixed population of pre- or post-exposed 
 individuals. the data thus might represent a combined pre-and post-exposure effect of the vaccine.</p><p>
 it is unknown from breakthrough cases whether the vaccine would prevent mortality/morbidity and/or 
 viral persistence in sanctuary sites such as the eye or brain. 
 there is limited data to conclude on the use in pregnant women and in immunocompromised individuals.</p><p> 
 there are no data on co-administration with other vaccines, hence co-administration is not 
 recommended.</p><p>
 it is uncertain whether the vaccine would protect against genetic variants of the zaire ebolavirus as it is 
 currently not known which epitopes are responsible for the immune responses. also, within the same 
 species of zaire ebolavirus, genetic differences between viruses have been reported. nevertheless, while 
 the vaccine construct is based on the zaire kikwit strain, it was shown that v920 was effective against the 
 zaire makona strain that circulated in west africa in 2014-2016, and preliminary data suggest efficacy 
 against the strain currently circulating in the drc. 
 a correlate of protection is currently not known. the immunogenicity data indicate a sustainable humoral 
 immune response induced by ervebo through two years (v920-012 study). antibodies measured by 
 elisa tend to decline slight to moderate, but continuously through two years. this effect is less visible in 
 antibodies measured by prnt. in lack of an immune correlate or of a biomarker for protection, sustained 
 long-term efficacy cannot be directly inferred from the persisting antibody titres. long-term 
 immunogenicity and the need/optimal time point for a booster dose are currently unknown.</p><p>
 the evaluation of immunogenicity was based on ebola-gp-specific igg antibodies measured by elisa and 
 neutralizing antibodies by prnt assay. no conclusive analysis of cmi responses after vaccination is 
 currently available. see section 3.7.2 for uncertainties with respect to manufacturing process details.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>the safety of v920 was assessed based on data collected in 15.398 healthy adults receiving ≥2x107 pfu in 8 phase 1 studies and 4 phase 2/3 studies. the trials were conducted in different geographical regions 
 (e.g., africa only vs europe/north america only) and under different circumstances (e.g., outbreak vs 
 non-outbreak, community vs clinical settings), and used varying methods for data collection (e.g., phone 
 contact with subjects vs in-person visits). a total of 234 children and adolescents 6 to &lt;18 years of age 
 were enrolled and received the clinical dose. also, 536 (8.4%) of eligible, consented subjects were ≥65 
 years of age in the v920-010 trial. a total of 261 women were incidentally found to be pregnant after 
 vaccination.</p><p>
 the most common injection-site adverse reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%) 
 and erythema (13.7%). the most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination

 (17.1%), nausea (8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and 
 abdominal pain (1.4%). in general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were 
 mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). arthralgia was generally</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 in the phase i studies as well in the phase ii/iii studies arthritis and arthralgia were recorded with a

 after the end of the trial. 
 rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash, dermatitis, vesicular rash or 
 cutaneous vasculitis. in a small number of subjects, the v920 vaccine virus was detected in rashes 
 (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process 
 post-vaccination. there was no evidence of systemic vasculitis. 
 transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the first 3 days 
 following vaccination have been observed very commonly in phase 1 studies. these events generally 
 resolved after the first week post-vaccination.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.

 virus was not evaluated in clinical trials. a theoretical possibility of transmission of the vaccine virus 
 through contacts of vaccinated persons exists. therefore, a minimum 6-weeks period is currently 
 recommended as the time required for vaccinees to avoid blood donation and contact with blood and 
 bodily fluids as well as at risk individuals.</p><p>
 safety in pregnant/breastfeeding women is not established. some data is available but is not sufficient to 
 draw conclusions; therefore, vaccination should be avoided during pregnancy and pregnancy should be 
 avoided for 2 months after vaccination. more information should become available from the expanded 
 access protocol in drc. nevertheless, considering the severity of evd, vaccination should not be withheld 
 when there is a clear risk of exposure to ebola infection.</p><p>
 the safety of ervebo has not been assessed in severely immunocompromised individuals. in individuals 
 with a defect in innate or adaptive immunity, the live-replicating vaccine could theoretically produce a 
 more active or long-lasting infection with the vaccine virus, the outcome of which could be a severe 
 illness. more data is expected post-authorisation from planned studies.</p><p>
 vaccine virus rna was found in blood, saliva and urine, synovial fluid (in 3 subjects who had arthritis 
 teaes) and vesicles (n=4/10) of vaccinated adults, although at low incidence and low copy number in 
 most adult subjects. transmission through close personal contact is a theoretical possibility but is 
 considered to be low risk because of the low magnitude of shedding. transmission of vaccine virus was 
 not evaluated in clinical trials. see section 3.7.2 for uncertainties with respect to manufacturing process 
 details.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</header><p>the proposed indication for ervebo is for active immunization of individuals 18 years of age or older to protect against ebola virus disease (evd) caused by zaire ebola virus. 
 the observed vaccine effect against evd and evd death is representing a true clinical benefit. the 
 evidence for vaccine efficacy is adequate, based on the comprehensive analysis sets and the fact that 
 none of the 5,837 vaccinated subjects developed evd 10 days or more post-vaccination, regardless of the 
 allocated groups. as evd has an incubation time of 2-21 days (mainly 8-10 days), vaccination could occur 
 during the incubation time and these evd cases could be included in the primary efficacy analysis despite 
 the 10-day censor period. thus, the efficacy data may cover both pre-and post-exposure prophylactic 
 effect of the vaccine. v920 induces robust immune responses upon vaccination with a single dose, and 
 provides protection after ebov challenge in nhp. together with the demonstration of immunogenicity in 
 human, these nc data suggest that ab might be important in the prophylactic protection in humans. since 
 the viruses that cause evd are located mainly in sub-saharan africa, the use of ervebo within the 
 european context is considered to be very specific, and is understood to be mainly aimed for health care 
 workers deploying to an ebola outbreak region (who would be vaccinated prior to embarking on such 
 mission) or for ring vaccination around an ‘imported’ evd case (where people at risk of being infected 
 would need to be identified).</p><p>
 vaccination was generally associated with a reactogenicity profile common to most vaccines. however, 
 several forms of arthritis were commonly observed, most of which resolved within days or weeks of onset, 
 but some became chronic (lasting up to 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up period) and 
 it is currently unclear if or when they will resolve.</p></section><section><header n="3.7.2">3.7.2.  
 balance of benefits and risks</header><p>the documented protective efficacy of ervebo against evd and evd death is considered to be of high clinical benefit, but the exact magnitude and duration of vaccine-induced protection is currently still not 
 fully known. thus, it remains of utmost importance that vaccinees continue to adhere to ebola control 
 measures. the protection observed within a ring vaccination context in an outbreak region might also be 
 less robust as compared to a blinded, placebo controlled trial, mostly because efficacy could only be 
 evaluated in a short time window, therefore until new data is assessed it is important that the vaccine is 
 considered for used in individuals at immediate risk of infection.</p><p>
 based on the available safety data it can be concluded, that there is no safety concern related to the use 
 of v920 in the target population (adults &gt;18 yoa at risk of infection). the occurrence of chronic arthritis 
 in a limited number of subjects was considered to be clinically relevant and the occurrence of mild to 
 moderate reactogenicity was considered of limited clinical relevance. only limited safety data were 
 collected in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. this does not allow final conclusion 
 on the safe use in this special populations.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 the occurrence of binding and neutralizing antibodies against the ebola zaire gp-protein is considered to be relevant from an immunological point of view, but the clinical relevance in terms of magnitude and 
 duration of protection is uncertain, as there is no immune correlate of protection. nevertheless, the 
 immunogenicity data indicate a sustained humoral immune response induced by ervebo through two 
 years post-vaccination.</p><p>
 no clinical data on long term protection are available.</p></section><section><header>conditional marketing authorisation</header><p>data on certain manufacturing process details are incomplete at time of opinion, specifically on the confirmation of the validated status of the active substance (as) and finished product (fp) manufacturing 
 process. in addition, comprehensive comparability data demonstrating that the commercial product 
 manufactured at the burgwedel site has not yet been completed to confirm the representativeness of the 
 material used in the clinical trials. additional as and fp process validation/process performance 
 qualification (ppq) data and a comparability assessment will be provided post-approval. furthermore, 
 data are expected post-approval to: complete qualification of the master/working cell banks substrate 
 used for production to include also tests for specified viruses; provide additional qualification data for the 
 critical reagent used in the identity test (quality control release test for as and fp) and introduce an 
 additional in-process test for residual host cell protein, which will provide an additional control of 
 impurities in the absence of a fully validated process.</p><p>
 as the above requested data on product manufacture are not available at the time of opinion, a 
 conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the chmp during the assessment, after having 
 consulted the applicant. 
 the product falls within the scope of article 14-a of regulation (ec) no 726/2004 concerning conditional 
 marketing authorisations, as it aims at the prevention of a life-threatening disease. ebola virus disease 
 (evd) is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by ebola filovirus with case fatality ranging from 30% 
 to 90%. in addition, the product is to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats 
 duly recognised by the world health organisation. currently an ebola outbreak is ongoing in the 
 democratic republic of congo, which has been recognised by who as a pheic in august 2019, and 
 ervebo is being deployed in the region in the context of an expanded access protocol in collaboration with 
 who.</p><p>furthermore, the chmp considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
 authorisation: 
 • the benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. • it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. studies are underway to complete the manufacturing process details. detailed plans have been submitted in the dossier 
 regarding scheduling of process validation data and the feasibility of completion of all proposed 
 specific obligations has been assessed by the chmp based upon the applicant’s justification. based 
 on the applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil all sos will be 
 submitted by end october 2020. 
 • unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the data available indicate that ervebo is highly efficacious in preventing evd. there are no vaccines or therapeutics currently authorised for 
 prevention or treatment of evd.</p><p> 
 • the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. the current data set indicate but do not permit a definitive 
 conclusion that: the as process is sufficiently validated to be capable of producing as batches of</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/606159/2019</p><p>
 page 115/117</p><p>
 classified as public by the european medicines agency 
 adequate and consistent quality;</p><p>that the commercial product is fully comparable to the clinical batches used in the trials (produced at idt biologika and west point); that the viral safety testing 
 conducted on the master cell/ working cell substrates used for production is complete for two 
 specified viruses and that a critical reagent used in the identity test has been fully qualified. 
 specific obligations to collect these data have been set accordingly. since for biological products 
 a combination of specifications and process control/validation is per definition deemed essential to 
 guarantee product quality, it cannot be excluded that high variability of as lots (due to insufficient 
 process control) may result in differences in impurities or other properties or characteristics such 
 as vaccine stability. however, additional routine testing (for two key specified impurities) in order 
 to have an acceptable level of quality control of commercial product has been introduced and a 
 test for a third key impurity, residual host cell protein is expected to be implemented shortly 
 post-approval (specific obligation). with respect to viral safety testing of the cell banks substrates 
 used for production, the applicant has provided reassurance on the viral safety of the cell bank 
 system using a combination of specific tests and metagenomics analysis, however additional 
 testing is required to complete the testing. similarly, additional qualification data are required to 
 complete the information on the critical reagent used for the identity assay to fully confirm the 
 absence of any false-positive results.</p><p> 
 regarding vaccine potency however, any final product lots that comply with the currently 
 proposed fp specifications, and that are formulated using as lots that comply with the as 
 specifications, are expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches. despite 
 the potential risks described above with respect to manufacturing, the commercial process is 
 identical to the clinical lot process (also with respect to scale) and as such, when executed in line 
 with the described control strategy, the process is expected to yield as of the same quality. all 
 clinical lot material produced thus far has been shown to be of adequate and consistent quality. 
 the current specifications (including potency) and acceptance limits proposed for the maa are 
 deemed appropriate and sufficiently justified (taking into account results from clinical batches).</p><p>
 the additional data on the manufacturing process details of ervebo are expected to be submitted 
 by the end of october 2020. based on all the above it would not be considered appropriate to 
 withhold a highly beneficial vaccine considering the severity of evd and the international context 
 of the ongoing pheic, since the demonstrated benefits in the current emergency setting clearly 
 outweigh the risks related to the limitations of the available data concerning manufacture of this 
 product.</p></section><section><header n="3.8">3.8.
