 paediatric populationthe safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ervebo in children aged 1 to 17 years have not yet been established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</p><p>3method of administrationfor precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.
 for precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.
 ervebo should be administered by the intramuscular (im) route. the preferred site is the deltoid area 
 of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. do not inject the vaccine 
 intravascularly. no data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.
 cover the vaccination injection site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive 
 bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact (see 
 sections 4.4 and 5.3). the bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.

 hypersensitivity
 close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or 
 anaphylactoid reactions. as with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and 
 supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the 
 administration of the vaccine.
 duration of protection
 vaccination with ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees. vaccine efficacy has been 
 established in the period ≥10 to ≤31 days after vaccination, however the duration of protection is not 
 known (see section 5.1).</p></section><section><header>the use of other ebola control measures should therefore not beinterrupted</header><p>.vaccination of contacts of ebola cases should occur as soon as possible (see section 5.1).
 standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected ebola disease 
 vaccination with ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for 
 patients with known or suspected ebola disease.</p></section><section><header>all healthcare workers and other ancillary providers who have been vaccinated should not alter their practices with regard to safe 
 injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (ppe) after vaccination.</header><p>healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and 
 contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. samples taken from humans and</p><p>4animals for investigation of ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.
 vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with adequate 
 measures.
 immunocompromised individuals
 safety and efficacy of ervebo have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. 
 immunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to 
 ervebo. as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of ervebo in individuals with 
 known immunocompromised conditions or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including the 
 following conditions:
 severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia, and aids or symptomatic hiv infection. a cd4+ 
 t-lymphocyte count threshold for use in asymptomatic hiv-positive individuals has not been 
 established.
 current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroid. this does not include individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids 
 (e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).
 diseases of the blood such as leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.
 family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
 pregnant and breast-feeding women
 as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of ervebo during pregnancy. see section 
 4.6.
 transmission
 vaccine virus might be present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids, 
 aqueous humor, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid, and placenta. vaccine virus rna has been 
 detected by pcr in the plasma of most of the adult subjects. vaccine virus rna was mainly detected 
 from day 1 to day 7. shedding of vaccine virus has been detected by pcr in urine or saliva in 19 out 
 of 299 adult subjects and in skin vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult subjects. the vaccine virus rna was 
 detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days post-vaccination in one of the four subjects.
 viral shedding was observed more frequently in children and adolescents (28/39) compared to adults.
 transmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact is accepted as a theoretical possibility.
 vaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and 
 bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. high-risk individuals include:
 immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see section above),
 pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6),children &lt;1 year of age.individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they 
 heal to minimize the risk of possible transmission of vaccine virus through open vesicles. dispose of 
 contaminated bandages following institutional guidelines or who healthcare waste management 
 policy. see section 5.3.</p><p>5inadvertent transmission of vaccine virus to animals and livestock is also theoretically possible, see below. 
 individuals administered ervebo should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.
 transmission to animals and livestock
 transmission of vaccine virus through close contact with livestock is accepted as a theoretical 
 possibility. vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids 
 for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the 
 vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. dispose of contaminated bandages following 
 institutional guidelines or who healthcare waste management policy. see section 5.3.
 concurrent illness
 vaccination should be postponed in subjects experiencing moderate or severe febrile illness. the 
 presence of a minor infection should not result in deferral of vaccination.
 thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders
 the vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation 
 disorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these 
 individuals.
 protection against filovirus disease
 the vaccine will not prevent disease caused by filoviruses other than zaire ebola virus.
 impact to serological testing 
 following vaccination with ervebo, individuals may test positive for ebola glycoprotein (gp) nucleic 
 acids, antigens, or antibodies against ebola gp, which are targets for certain ebola diagnostic tests. 
 therefore, diagnostic testing for ebola should target non-gp sections of the ebola virus.
 sodium
 this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be
 essentially sodium-free.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no interaction studies have been performed.as there are no data on co-administration of ervebo with other vaccines, the concomitant use of 
 ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.
 immune globulin (ig), blood or plasma transfusions should not be given concomitantly with ervebo. 
 administration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transfusions administered 3 months before or up 
 to 1 month after ervebo administration may interfere with the expected immune response.
 it is unknown whether concurrent administration of antiviral medication including interferons could 
 impact vaccine virus replication and efficacy.</p></section><section><header>4.6fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy 6there are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ervebo in pregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. the safety of ervebo
 has not been established in pregnant women.
 as there are limitations to available data, including the small number of cases, caution should be 
 exercised in drawing conclusions. lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and 
 neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging.
 animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
 (see section 5.3).
 as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of ervebo during pregnancy. nevertheless 
 considering the severity of evd, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of 
 exposure to ebola infection.
 pregnancy should be avoided for 2 months following vaccination. women of child-bearing potential
 should use an effective contraceptive method. 
 breast-feeding
 it is unknown whether the vaccine virus is secreted in human milk.
 a risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded. 
 evaluation of the vaccine virus in animal milk has not been conducted. when ervebo is administered 
 to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in offspring, likely due to acquisition 
 of maternal antibodies via placental transfer during gestation and via lactation. see section 5.3.
 a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from ervebo taking into 
 account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. in certain 
 circumstances, where alternatives to breastfeeding are limited, the immediate need and health benefits 
 to the infant should be taken into consideration and balanced with the mother’s need for ervebo. both 
 may present compelling needs that should be considered before vaccination of the mother.
 fertility
 there are no data on fertility effects in humans.
 animal studies in female rats do not indicate harmful effects (see section 5.3).</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects of ervebo on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. ervebo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>summary of the safety profileanaphylaxis was reported very rarely (0.006%) in clinical trials.

 §see description of selected adverse reactions.description of selected adverse reactions
 arthralgia and arthritisarthralgia was generally reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within one week after onset. arthritis (arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling, 
 osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was generally reported within the first few weeks 
 following vaccination. in clinical trials with reports of arthritis, the median onsets were between 10 
 and 12 days (range from 0 to 25 days). arthritis has been reported by subjects in clinical trials at a 
 frequency that ranged from 0% in several protocols to 23.5% in one phase 1 study. the majority of 
 arthritis reactions were mild to moderate in severity. the median duration of arthritis across clinical 
 trials in which arthritis was reported ranged from 2 days to 81.5 days (including duration of recurrent 
 arthritis) with a maximum of 330 days. the reasons for differences in arthritis reporting across trials 
 are not known but may be due to differences in study populations or outcome reporting. in the phase 1 
 study with the highest rate of arthritis, 6 of 24 patients (25%) who reported arthritis after vaccination 
 had persistent joint symptoms two years after vaccination. in a small number of subjects, the vaccine 
 virus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally-mediated process post-
 vaccination.
 rashrash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%), dermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical trials. in different trials, rash was 
 reported with median onsets of 7.5 to 10.5 days (range from 0 to 47 days). the median durations</p><p>8reported were between 6 to 18 days. in 6 out of 18 subjects tested, the vaccine virus was detected in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated 
 process post-vaccination.
 transient decrease in white blood cellstransient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the first 3 days following vaccination have been observed very commonly in phase 1/2 studies; these events generally
 resolved after the first week post-vaccination. no adverse events of infections were observed in phase 
 1/2 trials.
 paediatric population
 across the phase 1 through phase 3 trials, 234 children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age received a 
 dose of ervebo.
 the safety profile of ervebo in children and adolescents 6 to17 years of age was generally similar to 
 that observed in adults. 
 reporting of suspected adverse reactions
 reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. it 
 allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare 
 professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
 listed in 
 appendix v

 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccine, atc code: j07bx02mechanism of action
 ervebo consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing 
 the envelope glycoprotein gene of zaire ebola virus (rvsv∆g-zebov-gp). immunization of 
 subjects with the vaccine results in an immune response and protection from zaire ebola virus 
 disease (evd). the relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to 
 protection from zaire ebola virus are unknown.
 clinical efficacy
 the clinical development program included four phase 2/3 (protocols 009-012) clinical trials. all 
 subjects received a single dose of vaccine. clinical efficacy of ervebo was assessed in protocol 010.
 protocol 010 (ring vaccination study) was a phase 3 open-label cluster-randomized trial of ring 
 vaccination (vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts [cccs] of index ebola cases) which
 evaluated efficacy and safety of ervebo in guinea. in this trial, 9,096 subjects ≥18 years of age who 
 were considered cccs of an index case with laboratory-confirmed evd were randomized to 
 immediate (4,539 subjects in 51 clusters) or 21 days delayed (4,557 subjects in 47 clusters) 
 vaccination with ervebo. of those 9,096 subjects, 4,160 received ervebo (2,119 subjects were 
 vaccinated in the immediate arm and 2,041 subjects were vaccinated in the delayed arm). the median 
 age of consenting cccs was 35 years old. the final primary analysis included 2,108 subjects (51</p><p>9clusters) vaccinated in the immediate arm and 1,429 subjects (46 clusters) eligible and consented on day 0 in the delayed arm.
 the final primary analysis was to assess efficacy against laboratory confirmed evd by comparing 
 incidence of cases occurring 10 to 31 days post-randomization for those vaccinated in the immediate 
 vaccination rings versus incidence of cases for subjects who consented on day 0 in the delayed 
 vaccination rings. vaccine efficacy was 100% (unadjusted 95% ci: 63.5% to 100%; 95% ci adjusted 
 for multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate arm; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed 
 arm). randomization was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre-
 specified alpha level of 0.0027. of the 10 cases, 7 were in contacts, and 3 in contacts-of-contacts.
 uncertainties remain as to the level, duration and type of protection given the methodological 
 limitations and the exceptional circumstances experienced during the trial. 
 clinical immunogenicity
 no immune correlates of protection have been defined to date.
 protocol 009 partnership for research on ebola vaccines in liberia (prevail) was a phase 2 
 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 
 ebola vaccine candidates including ervebo. this trial compared ervebo to normal saline placebo in 
 1,000 adults ≥18 years of age in liberia.
 protocol 011 named sierra leone trial to introduce a vaccine against ebola (strive) was a phase 
 2/3 randomized open-label trial which evaluated safety and immunogenicity of ervebo in adults 
 ≥18 years of age working in healthcare facilities or on frontline activities related to the ebola response 
 in sierra leone. in this trial, 8,673 adult subjects were enrolled and 8,651 with valid consents 
 randomized to immediate (within 7 days of enrolment) or deferred (18 to 24 weeks after enrolment) 
 vaccination with ervebo. an immunogenicity sub-study included 508 subjects who were vaccinated 
 and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.
 protocol 012 was a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the 
 safety and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot (approximately five times 
 higher than the dose in consistency lots and dose used in other phase 2/3 trials) of ervebo compared to 
 normal saline placebo. a total of 1,197 healthy subjects 18 to 65 years of age were enrolled in the us, 
 canada, and spain.
 immunogenicity testing has been performed in protocol 009, protocol 011 and protocol 012, and 
 includes the assessment of binding immunoglobulin g (igg) specific to purified kikwit zebov gp 
 by validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (gp-elisa) as well as validated neutralization of 
 vaccine virus by a plaque reduction neutralization test (prnt).
 as shown in tables 2 and 3, the geometric mean titers (gmt) of gp-elisa and prnt increased 
 from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination. over 93.8% of vaccine recipients met seroresponse criteria 
 defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 eu/ml at any time post-vaccination by gp-
 elisa and over 80.4% of subjects met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥4-fold increase from 
 baseline at any time post-vaccination by prnt. over 80.1% of subjects continued to meet the 
 seroresponse criteria for gp-elisa and over 63.5% of vaccine recipients continued to meet 
 seroresponse criteria for prnt at 12 months. the clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is 
 currently not known.
 efficacy data was obtained in protocol 010 in guinea and immunogenicity data was obtained in 
 protocol 009 in liberia, protocol 011 in sierra leone, and protocol 012 in the united states, canada, 
 and europe. baseline seropositivity, gamma irradiation of specimens to reduce risk of wild-type ebola 
 virus infection of laboratory workers, and other factors may impact the immune response to vaccine, 
 which results in a higher immune response in protocol 012. although the clinical relevance of the gp-
 elisa gmt as well as seroresponse is currently not known, based on available data it is expected that</p><p>10vaccine efficacy would apply to subjects from guinea, liberia, sierra leone, the united states, canada, europe, or other parts of the world.

 this medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme.
 this means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.
 the european medicines agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every
 year and this smpc will be updated as necessary.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>not applicable.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.
 when ervebo was administered to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in 
 foetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition 
 of maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively (see section 4.6).
 ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or 
 embryonic/foetal development.
 ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on development or behaviour of the offspring.
 environmental risk assessment (era)
 the vaccine virus is a genetically modified organism (gmo). an era was conducted to determine 
 the potential impact of this vaccine on human health and the environment. because this vaccine is 
 based on vsv, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk assessment included 
 species that are relevant for the wild type (wt) vsv backbone of this vaccine.
 in a biodistribution study conducted in non-human primates, vaccine virus rna was detected in 
 lymphoid organs up to 112 days post-vaccination. however, infectious virus was detected at day 1 
 and persistent infectious virus was not detected at any subsequent timepoints measured (days 56, 84
 and 112).
 based on limited shedding in adults, the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of 
 horizontal transmission in pigs, the overall risk of ervebo to human health and the environment is</p><p>12considered negligible. however, as a precaution, vaccinees should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical 
 risk of spread of the vaccine virus. people who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine 
 should cover the vesicles until they heal. cover the vaccination site or any vesicles with an adequate 
 bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect 
 against direct contact with vesicle fluid (see section 4.2). the bandage may be removed when there is 
 no visible fluid leakage. to avoid unintended exposure to livestock, ensure medical waste and other 
 cleaning materials do not come in contact with livestock.

 as it is not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. the thawed vial should then 
 be gently inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe. the vaccine should appear</p><p>13as a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid with no particulates visible. discard the vaccine if particulates are present.
 withdraw the entire content of the vaccine from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.if feasible, the waste liquid from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before 
 discarding into the drain.
 any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional 
 guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.
 if breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are proven 
 to reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes.</p></section><section><header>7.marketing authorisation holder</header><p>merck sharp &amp; dohme b.v.waarderweg 39

 contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header>1.what ervebo is and what it is used for</header><p>ervebo is a vaccine for adults who are 18 years of age and older.ervebo is given to protect you from getting ebola virus disease caused by the zaire ebola virus, which is a type of ebola virus. this vaccine will not protect you against the other types of ebola 
 virus.
 because ervebo does not contain the whole ebola virus, it cannot give you ebola virus disease.your healthcare worker may recommend that you receive this vaccine in an emergency involving the 
 spread of ebola virus disease.
 what is ebola?
 ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. if you get ebola, it can kill you. people catch ebola from people or animals who are infected with ebola or who died from ebola.
 you can catch ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with ebola virus.
 you can also catch ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or animal with ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).
 ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.your healthcare worker will talk to you and then together you can decide if you should receive this 
 vaccine.</p></section><section><header>2.what you need to know before you receive ervebo
 do not receive ervebo if you:</header><p>are allergic to ervebo, rice, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).you should not receive ervebo if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your 
 healthcare worker.</p><p>24</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>this vaccine might not protect everyone who receives it and the length of time you are protected from ebola by ervebo is not known.
 continue to follow your healthcare worker’s recommendations to protect yourself from ebola 
 infection after you get this vaccine.
 washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like 
 ebola virus. it reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to 
 person.
 proper hand washing methods are described below.
 use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. there is no need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.
 use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. do not use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.
 while in an area affected by ebola, it is important to avoid the following:
 contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids).
 items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).
 funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from ebola.contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
 contact with semen from a man who had ebola. you should follow safe sex practices until you know the virus is gone from the semen.
 if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals. put the used 
 plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them in the waste bin to to make 
 sure that people with a weak immune system or animals do not come into contact with the plasters and 
 bandages.
 talk to your healthcare worker before you receive ervebo if you:
 have had allergic reactions to vaccines or medicines
 if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine or medicine, talk to your healthcare worker before you receive this vaccine.
 have a weak immune system
 if your immune system is weak (which means your body is less able to fight off diseases), you might 
 not be able to receive ervebo. you might have a weak immune system if:
 you have hiv infection or aids,you are taking certain medicines that make your immune system weak such as immunosuppressants or corticosteroids,
 you have cancer or a blood problem that makes your immune system weak,a member of your family has a weak immune system.if you think you might have a weak immune system, ask your healthcare worker if you should receive
 this vaccine. if you do get the vaccine and have a weak immune system, the vaccine may not work as 
 well as in people with a normal immune system.
 are in contact with vulnerable individuals
 tell your healthcare worker if in the 6 weeks after you receive ervebo you might be in close contact 
 with or in the same household as:
 babies who are less than 1 year old,</p><p>25someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding,someone who has a weak immune system.this is because you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to them through your body fluids.
 if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals. put the used 
 plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the garbage bin to 
 avoid having people with a weak immune system come into contact with the plasters and bandages.
 plan to donate blood
 do not donate blood for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine.are in contact with farm animals
 make sure your blood or body fluids do not come into close contact with farm animals for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine. this is because of a possibility that you could pass 
 on the virus in the vaccine to the animals.
 if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals.put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the garbage bin to avoid having animals come into contact with the plasters and bandages.
 have a fever (high temperature)
 if you have a fever (high temperature), you should talk to your healthcare worker before receiving ervebo. the vaccination may have to be delayed until your fever is gone.
 a minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem but talk to your healthcare workerbefore receiving ervebo.
 have a bleeding disorder or bruise easily
 tell your healthcare worker if you have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily. ervebomight make you bleed or bruise where the vaccine is injected.
 testing for ebola after you receive ervebo
 you may test positive for ebola virus after you receive ervebo. this does not mean that you have ebola. tell your healthcare worker that you have received ervebo. your healthcare worker
 might need to do another test.
 if any of the above warnings and precautions apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your healthcare 
 worker before receiving ervebo.</p></section><section><header>children and adolescents</header><p>if you or your child is under 18 years old, talk to your healthcare worker. it is not known if it is safe and works in children and adolescents.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and ervebo</header><p>tell your healthcare worker if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines.
 no studies have looked at how other medicines or vaccines and ervebo might interact with each other.
 use of ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.

 the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
 standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected ebola disease</p><p>30vaccination with ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected ebola disease.</p></section><section><header>all healthcare workers, and other ancillary providers who have been vaccinated, should not alter their practices with regard to safe 
 injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (ppe) after vaccination.</header><p>standard precautions, as outlined by who, include the following:basic hand hygienerespiratory hygieneuse of ppe (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials)safe injection practicessafe burial practiceshealthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed ebola virus should apply extra 
 infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and 
 contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. when in close contact (within 1 
 metre) of patients with ebola virus disease, healthcare workers should wear face protection (a face 
 shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile 
 gloves for some procedures).
 laboratory workers are also at risk. samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of 
 ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.
 vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with the following 
 measures:
 hand washing avoid contact with blood and body fluids safe burial practicessafe sexavoid contact with bats and non-human primates or blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
 instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration
 ervebo is stored frozen at -80°c to -60°c and should be removed from the freezer and thawed in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator as it is 
 not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. the thawed vial should then be gently 
 inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe.
 after thawing, ervebo should be used immediately; however, in-use stability data have demonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2°c to 8°c prior 
 to use. at the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. upon removal from the 
 freezer, the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and 
 also a new discard date (in place of the labelled expiry date). once thawed, the vaccine cannot 
 be re-frozen.
 ervebo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid. discard the vaccine if particulates are present.
 ervebo should be administered intramuscularly. do not inject the vaccine intravascularly. no data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.
 ervebo should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.withdraw the entire content of ervebo from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe. the preferred injection site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral 
 area of the thigh. cover the injection site with gauze or bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or 
 gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle 
 fluid. the bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.</p><p>31any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in compliance with the institutional guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate. if 
 breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are 
 proven to reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes. if feasible, the waste liquid 
 from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before discarding into the drain.</p><p>32</p></section><section><header>annex ivconclusions on the granting of the conditional marketing
