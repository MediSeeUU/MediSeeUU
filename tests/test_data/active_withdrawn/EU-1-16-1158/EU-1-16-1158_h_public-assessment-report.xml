 disease or condition</header><p>haemophilia a is a rare and serious, x-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males and is characterized by a deficiency of fviii. in patients with haemophilia a, the primary 
 platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 10/103</p><p> 
 inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. rarely, 
 life-threatening bleeding may also occur. patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
 extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient fviii that is used to classify the disease severity (wfh, 
 2012): 
 • 
 &gt;1% fviii activity: severe haemophilia a 
 • 
 1% to 5% fviii activity: moderate haemophilia a 
 • 
 5% to 40% fviii activity: mild haemophilia a 
 patients with severe haemophilia a bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
 permanent, disabling joint damage. 
 afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a 
 (congenital factor viii deficiency). afstyla can be used for all age groups.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.2">2.1.2.  
 epidemiology</header><p>the overall reported number of haemophilia a patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the world federation of haemophilia (wfh) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
 identified 140,313 people with haemophilia a (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). there are currently 
 approximately 30,000 patients in the eu with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
 10,000. 
 haemophilia a is inherited as an x-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
 history and a carrier mother. approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; their 
 disease is presumably caused by new mutations.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.3">2.1.3.  
 biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis</header><p>the factor viii/von willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor viii and von willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. when infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
 factor viii binds to von willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. activated factor viii acts as a 
 cofactor for activated factor ix, accelerating the conversion of factor x to activated factor x. activated 
 factor x converts prothrombin into thrombin. thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot 
 can be formed.</p></section><section><header n="2.1.4">2.1.4.  
 clinical presentation, diagnosis</header><p>haemophilia a manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
 chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (bolton-maggs and pasi, 2003). the majority of bleeding 
 occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. serious 
 bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and forearm, 
 and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. less frequently, life 
 threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the gastrointestinal system or 
 enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. the approximate frequencies of bleeds at the 
 different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (hemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in muscle, 5 to 10% in the central 
 nervous system, and &lt; 5% for bleeds at all other sites (srivastava et al., 2013).</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 11/103</p></section><section><header n="2.1.5">2.1.5.  
 management</header><p>standard treatment for haemophilia a patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of exogenous fviii concentrates (as plasma-derived fviii [pdfviii] or recombinant fviii [rfviii] 
 concentrates). treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
 prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of fviii given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). in 
 the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
 prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
 prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia a 
 patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. major advances in the safety of clotting 
 factor products, including the availability of rfviii concentrates, the availability of comprehensive 
 haemophilia a treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home 
 treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with 
 haemophilia a to lead a “close to normal” life.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>afstyla is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized, white to slightly yellow powder or friable mass intended for intravenous administration provided in a single-use vial.</p><p>
 it is a recombinant human protein that replaces the missing coagulation factor viii needed for effective 
 hemostasis. afstyla is a single polypeptide chain with a truncated b-domain that allows for a covalent 
 bond to link the factor viii heavy and light chains. afstyla has demonstrated a higher vwf affinity relative 
 to full-length rfviii. vwf stabilizes factor viii and protects it from degradation. activated afstyla has an 
 amino acid sequence identical to endogenous fviiia. 
 each single-use vial contains nominally 250 iu, 500 iu, 1000 iu, 1500 iu, 2000 iu, 2500 iu or 3000 iu 
 (international units) of rviii-singlechain for reconstitution with liquid diluent (sterile water for 
 injection), which is provided in glass vials (2.5 ml swfi: 250 iu, 500 iu, 1000 iu; 5.0 ml swfi: 1500 iu, 
 2000 iu, 2500 iu, 3000 iu).</p></section><section><header>type of application and aspects on development</header><p>this application has been submitted as an article 8.3 of directive 2001/83/ec as a new active substance, lonoctocog alfa. afstyla contains the rfviii protein</p><p>
 afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a 
 (congenital factor viii deficiency). afstyla can be used for all age groups. 
 the posology for on demand treatment is proposed as follows: 
 the calculation of the required dose of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international 
 unit (iu) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 2 iu/dl.</p><p>
 the required dose is determined using the following formula: dose (iu) = body weight (kg) x desired 
 factor viii rise (iu/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (iu/kg per iu/dl). 
 the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
 clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
 in the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor viii activity should not fall below the given 
 plasma activity level (in % of normal or iu/dl) within the corresponding period. the following table can be 
 used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 for long term prophylaxis, the recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 iu/kg of afstyla administered 
 2 to 3 times weekly. the regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.</p><p> previously untreated patients: the safety and efficacy of afstyla in previously untreated patients have not been established. no data are available. 
 paediatric patients: the recommended starting regimen in children (0 to &lt;12 years of age) is 30 to 50 iu per kg of afstyla administered 2 to 3 times weekly. more frequent or higher doses may be required in children &lt;12 years 
 of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. for adolescents of 12 years of age and above, 
 the dose recommendations are the same as for adults. 
 the development of afstyla is in agreement with the paediatric investigation plan (pip); pip

 of the b-domain and 4 amino acids of the adjacent acidic a3 domain were removed(amino acids 765 to 
 1652 of full-length fviii, including the furin-cleavage site). the newly formed linkage of the heavy and 
 light chain of fviii introduces a new n-glycosylation site. it has 1444 amino acids in a single chain 
 glycopeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 170 kda.</p><p>
 after activation by thrombin and removal of the (residual) b- and a3-domain, the activated rfviii (rfviiia) 
 molecule formed has an amino acid sequence identical to fviiia formed from endogenous, full length, 
 fviii. 
 the three dimensional structure of rviii-singlechain is stabilized by eight disulphide bridges. the 
 presence of three “free thiols” has been confirmed. regarding glycosylation, rviii-singlechain contains 
 six n-glycosylation sites, but was found to have limited o-glycosylation. rviii-singlechain also exhibits 
 nearly complete sulphation of its tyrosine residues.</p></section><section><header>manufacture, characterisation and process controls</header><p>the manufacturing process of the active substance consists of an upstream cell culture process and a downstream purification process. the manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail in line 
 with ich q11. for all sites involved in manufacture and testing of rfviii-singlechain bulk drug 
 intermediate (bdi) and active substance compliance to cgmp has been confirmed by respective 
 certificates issued by eu competent authorities.</p><p>
 the active substance manufacturing process consists of 12 steps, including cell culture, column 
 chromatography purification and concentration unit operations. additionally there are 3 validated virus 
 removal steps two of which are dedicated.</p><p>
 the first steps cover the wcb vial thaw, cell expansion and bioreactor cultivation. obtained harvests are 
 concentrated and stored. the hold time of the harvest bags has been adequately justified. two 
 chromatography steps for primary capture, concentration and buffer exchange, and a solvent/detergent 
 (s/d) virus inactivation step are performed to obtain the bdi.</p><p>
 the downstream purification process consists of 3 chromatography steps for further purification and a 
 virus nanofiltration step.</p><p>
 the upstream part of the manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. it can be 
 concluded that the rfviii-singlechain is produced in a state-of-the-art, well-controlled and efficient cell 
 culture process.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 14/103</p><p> 
 the downstream purification process follows a common purification strategy, consisting of chromatography and filtration steps and two virus-removal steps. full-scale validation studies on the 
 re-use and regeneration of chromatography columns have been provided.</p><p>
 control of materials 
 in line with ich q5b, the source and history of the cho cell line into which the rfviii gene transcript was 
 cloned and the characteristics of the mammalian expression vector have been described. the parental cell 
 line is commonly used for the expression of foreign proteins. the rationale for particular characteristics of 
 the rfviii construct has been described: a stable and efficiently expressed construct was selected by 
 analysing structure-function relationships of various constructs. most suitable characteristics were a 
 b-domain-deleted construct with reduced proteolytic degradation, intact thrombin cleavage sites and 
 linker sequence for full activation and coagulation activity, good von willebrand factor (vwf) binding, and 
 low immunogenic risk of the linker region. the rationale for the introduction of an additional 
 n-glycosylation site in the linker region in order to reduce the antigenicity risk has been provided. 
 the cho host cell line used to create the rviii-singlechain cell substrate was confirmed to be free from 
 contamination by viruses, bacteria (including mycoplasma) and fungi (moulds and yeasts). cell bank 
 characterisation test reports have been provided and the integrity of the final expression vectors was 
 verified.</p><p>
 in line with ich q5a (r1) “quality of biotechnological products: viral safety evaluation of biotechnology 
 products derived from cell lines of human or animal origin” and q5d the comparability of the mcb, the 
 wcb and the post production cell bank (ppcb) with respect to identity, the absence of adventitious agents 
 and the genetic stability has been demonstrated. 
 a two-tiered cell banking system has been established using a mcb and a wcb. the wcb was found to be 
 free of adventitious agents, genetically stable, and comparable to the underlying mcb.</p><p>
 the genetic stability and productivity beyond the 
 in vitro cell age has been demonstrated on an end-of-production (eop) cell bank and a post-production cell bank (ppcb).</p><p>
 most raw materials used in the manufacture of bdi and of active substance are of ph. eur. quality. for 
 non-compendial raw materials satisfactory specifications have been presented. beside the host cell line of 
 hamster origin no other raw material of human or animal origin is used in the purification and formulation 
 processes of rfviii-singlechain. 
 all chromatography steps are performed in the absence of any human-or animal-derived raw material and 
 each chromatography resin in use is dedicated to rfviii-singlechain. all materials used in the 
 manufacture of filters are either animal free or in compliance with 
 note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
 products (
 ema/410/01, current version). control of critical steps and intermediates 
 the rviii-singlechain active substance process control strategy was developed using a systematic, 
 scientific, and risk-based approach. the control strategy was developed to appropriately control sources 
 of process variability such that the desired process performance and product quality (i.e., critical quality 
 attributes (cqa)) are consistently achieved. this included process parameters classification and process 
 parameter risk assessment. respective risk assessment reports have been provided. in their process 
 control strategy (pcs) “critical steps” have been defined as those that contain critical process parameters 
 (cpp), in-process controls (ipc) and /or in-process acceptance criteria (ipac). cpp, ipc and ipac have</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 15/103</p><p> 
 been defined in accordance with ich q8(r2) and ich q6b. the limits/acceptance criteria are based on statistical analysis of historical data, process characterisation and process capability.</p><p>
 the monitoring parameters, the test methods and their acceptance criteria appear suitable to control the 
 bdi.</p><p>
 process validation</p><p>
 the process performance qualification was designed to verify the process control strategy by 
 demonstrating that the process, when operated within the defined ranges, produces rviii-singlechain as 
 that consistently meets all in-process controls, in process acceptance criteria, sampling/testing 
 requirements, and release specifications. 
 process validation master plans (pvmps) have been prepared which adopted very similar process 
 validation methodology and included implementation of the lifecycle approach to process validation. the 
 master plans describe the activities that are included in each stage of the rviii-singlechain as process 
 validation program including stage 1 (process design), stage 2 (process qualification) and stage 3 
 (continued process verification). the process validation uses small scale and full scale studies and follows 
 current fda and ema guidance on process validation.</p><p>
 the outcomes of the validation studies demonstrate that the manufacturing process operates at all steps 
 consistently within the proposed acceptance ranges and provides product that meets pre-set acceptance 
 criteria.</p><p> 
 in ancillary validation studies the mixing steps, intermediate hold times, chromatography resin and 
 membrane life times, as well as material shipment have been successfully validated. it has been 
 sufficiently demonstrated that the small scale experiments on the chromatography steps are 
 representative for the commercial scale process, including sanitization procedures. 
 manufacturing process development 
 two manufacturing scales can be distinguished: material from pilot scale cell culture was used for 
 preclinical and early clinical studies, commercial scale bioreactor material for later stage clinical 
 development. comparability of the material from the different development stages (plot and commercial 
 scale) has been demonstrated. no significant differences have been observed in the cell culture process 
 performance. comparison of in-process quality attributes during the downstream purification process at 
 pilot and commercial scale indicated that despite some differences at individual steps the results are 
 comparable.</p><p>
 characterisation 
 a detailed characterisation of rfviii-singlechain has been presented determining primary, secondary and 
 higher order structures, and studying functional properties in comparison to commercial rfviii and 
 plasma-derived fviii (pdfviii). the expected amino acid sequence of the fusion construct has been fully 
 confirmed. 
 from functional characterizations it is apparent that rfviii-singlechain has a much lower fviii activity in 
 the os clotting assay compared to the chromogenic substrate assay. the ratio os/chs assay activity is 
 ~0.5 and substantially lower than in other rfviii products or in pd fviii. the differences in fviii activity 
 between rfviii-singlechain and competitor rfviii products is more pronounced when using the os 
 assay, compared to the chs assay.</p><p>
 a respective statement is included in the smpc pointing out that the chromogenic substrate assay should 
 be used during clinical monitoring, if available. if the os assay is used, the results are approximately 45</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 16/103</p><p> 
 % lower than the chs results. it is indicated in the smpc that results from os and chs assay can be aligned by multiplying the os results by the factor 2. for practical reasons in daily clinical use, the 
 applicant decided to round the initially suggested factor 1.8 to 2, and amended the smpc accordingly.</p><p>
 the levels of product-related impurities present in commercial scale as batches were monitored by 
 several methods that are part of the as testing and by additional tests for a limited number of batches. in 
 general, a very low impurity level was observed. the formation of product related impurities is 
 convincingly controlled. 
 process related impurities have been investigated in detail using state-of-the-art methodology. major and 
 minor process-related impurities have been identified and characterised by sensitive analytical methods. 
 it is demonstrated that the manufacturing process effectively and consistently reduces impurities, and 
 that rviii-singlechain as contains only low level of process-related impurities which seem to be of no risk 
 for the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.</p></section><section><header>specification</header><p>the control of the active substance is performed in line with ich q6b. an adequate set of active substance release specification (table 1) has been established to cover structural and functional characteristics, 
 critical impurities and the safety of rfviii-singlechain. the specifications have been established based on 
 statistical evaluation of historical batch analysis data from as batches of pilot and commercial scale. 
 moreover, process and assay capability as well as patient safety and clinical experience were taken into 
 consideration when establishing release specifications. batch analysis data from pilot and commercial 
 scales as batches indicate that the as release specification is consistently met.</p><p>
 considerable variation in fviii one stage assay results is seen in active substance batches. this has been 
 adequately discussed from a quality and safety point of view. 
 for all analytical test procedures descriptions have been provided. the methods have been validated in 
 line with ich q1(r2).</p><p>
 reference standards 
 for the fviii potency an adequate characterisation of the working standard has been performed. a list of 
 acceptance criteria for current and future reference materials has been specified in case a replacement of 
 material is needed. the formulation (dilution) and the storage conditions of the reference standard have 
 been described, including the container closure system. a re-test period has been specified for the 
 potency standard or any other standard, including acceptance criteria for the declared potency value. the 
 reference standard has been calibrated against the who international standard (is).</p><p> 
 the initial potency assignment for new reference standards in relation to the current is or a new is and 
 the acceptance criteria for the establishment of new reference standards have been described in sufficient 
 detail. the strategy for replacement of the working standard and the proposed stability monitoring 
 program can be accepted. regarding the establishment of a new wrs or a new is, the proposed strategy 
 ensures that the consistency in the labelling of the clinical batches and the commercial batches during the 
 product life cycle is guaranteed.</p></section><section><header>stability</header><p>the stability of the active substance under long-term has been investigated in line with ich q5c “stability testing of biotechnological/biological products”. real time/real temperature data are presented for 
 commercial scale as batches. stability data provided no evidence that quality parameters show a 
 negative trending and the proposed shelf life can be accepted.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the active substance is either processed immediately after the virus filtration step or is stored for the claimed shelf life at the proposed storage conditions. the storage containers for the bulk active substance 
 are in compliance with compendial requirements (ph. eur. and usp). 
 adequate details on the storage containers used for the hold time stability studies of the bioreactor 
 harvests and chromatography eluates have been provided including data that demonstrate an acceptable 
 extractable and leachable level.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.3">2.2.3.

 intended for intravenous (i.v.) injection. the vials are closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed 
 with an aluminum overseal closure using different colors for the various strengths.</p><p>
 the active substance rviii-singlechain is formulated in a histidine buffer containing stabilizers and a 
 bulking agent. the formulation contains the excipients l-histidine, polysorbate 80, calcium chloride 
 dihydrate, sodium chloride and sucrose. all excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
 their quality is compliant with ph. eur. standards. there are no novel excipients used in the finished 
 product formulation. 
 the lyophilized finished product is reconstituted with sterile water for injections. for the 250 iu, 500 iu 
 and 1000 iu strengths 2.5 ml of swfi and for the 1500 iu, 2000 iu, 2500 iu and 3000 iu strengths 5.0 
 ml of swfi are used.</p><p>the development of the finished product manufacturing process occurred in two key stages. the pilot 
 scale process supplied finished product for preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies as well as 
 early clinical studies and stability studies (clinical study csl627_1001). the commercial scale process 
 (250 iu, 500 iu, 1000 iu, 2000 iu and 3000 iu) supplied finished product for further clinical studies 
 (csl627_1001, csl627_3001, csl627_3002), stability studies and ppq studies. 
 the first stage of the finished product development at the pilot scale comprised the development of the 
 1000 iu strength. later on during scale-up to the commercial scale production process, the additional 
 strengths including 250 iu, 500 iu, 2000 iu and 3000 iu were implemented. 
 the 1500 iu and 2500 iu strengths were introduced following completion of the development program for 
 the initial five strengths (250 iu, 500 iu, 1000 iu, 2000 iu and 3000 iu). the formulation development 
 studies resulted in a formulation procedure allowing all strengths to be formulated using the same 
 formulation buffer. the different strengths are formulated by addition of varying amounts of the 
 formulation buffer to obtain the desired strength. the formulation buffer developed is free of 
 animal-derived materials.</p><p>
 the unit operations were consistent throughout development. process changes included mostly scale-up 
 changes and also process optimizations were performed. the product fill volumes (2.5 ml: 250 iu, 500 iu, 
 1000 iu; 5,0 ml: 1500 iu, 2000 iu, 2500 iu, 3000 iu) as well as the respective lyophilisation cycles were 
 adapted depending on the strength. 
 two fill volume-specific lyophilitzation cycles were developed for the 250 iu, 500 iu and 1000 iu 
 strengths as well as for the 1500 iu, 2000 iu, 2500 iu and 3000 iu strengths (5,0 ml). the development 
 studies of the lyophilisation process lead to a robust commercial freeze-drying process which yields a 
 product with consistent quality attributes.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the finished product formulation was shown to be stable and no overages are applied during manufacture of the finished product. the stability data support compatibility of the active substance with the finished 
 product excipients. the lyophilized finished product is a white whole to slightly yellow powder.</p><p>
 no major process changes regarding the finished product manufacturing process occurred during the life 
 cycle from development to commercial scale manufacturing, indicating that the phase i, phase i/ii and 
 phase iii clinical trial material as well as the commercial product are manufactured by almost the same 
 process and are of comparable quality. no formulation changes were performed.</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product and process controls</header><p>the manufacturing of the finished product consists of formulation and sterile filtration, filling, lyophilization, capping and crimping, labelling and packaging. a detailed process flow diagram including a 
 summary of the in-process controls (ipc) and in-process acceptance criteria (ipac) tests conducted at 
 each stage of the manufacturing process and interim storage conditions has been provided.</p><p>
 the active substance from step 12 is the starting material for the finished product manufacturing process. 
 the active substance can be stored frozen at 
 ≤-65 °c or used immediately.</p><p>reprocessing 
 the validation reports supporting reprocessing for one step have been provided. 
 in addition, the process control strategy as well the controlled parameters (input and output parameters) 
 for the different operation units were described in detail. the risk priority number (rpn) for each input 
 parameter was calculated. these scores were used to identify potential high risk parameters that needed 
 specific focus in validation studies. the process is considered appropriately controlled. 
 control of critical steps and process control strategy during process development, a risk-based and science-based approach was used to reveal the relationship between manufacturing process variables and product quality attributes. 
 the process control strategy ensures consistent manufacture of finished product that meets its defined 
 critical quality attributes (cqas). in developing this strategy, all process parameters were evaluated with 
 regard to risk of failure, taking into account scientific rationale, data from process characterization studies 
 and historical manufacturing data. the suitability of the control strategy was confirmed during ppq.</p><p>
 a process validation master plan was developed which defines the strategy to ensure a reliable and 
 consistent manufacturing process capable of delivering product of appropriate quality. 
 the finished product manufacturing process was qualified according to a prospective ppq protocol which 
 defined the sampling, analytical testing and acceptance criteria for each process step. the ppq results 
 have been presented. taken together, all study objectives of the ppq were met and the defined pcs was 
 successfully validated for the manufacture of finished product. 
 validation data were presented covering the finished product manufacturing steps including formulation, 
 sterile filtration, filling and lyophilization. in addition, information on the hold times as well the 
 reprocessing at the sterile filtration step has been provided. 
 in general, the process validation strategy provided is acceptable and follows a continuous process 
 verification approach as described in the relevant guidelines on process validation for finished products 
 (ema/chmp/cvmp/qwp/bwp/70278/2012-rev1 – process validation; ich q8 (r2 – pharmaceutical

 adequate detail on the analytical procedures and their validation has been provided. batch analysis</p><p>
 based on the batch analysis data presented for the commercial batches (validated process), acceptance 
 criteria for the parameter protein concentration were introduced. in addition, the limits (release and shelf

 the information provided on the batch analysis data as well as on the characterization of the process- and 
 product-related impurities is considered appropriate. product-derived impurities, e.g. aggregates and 
 degradation products are controlled in both the active substance and the finished product manufacturing 
 process. specifications regarding product-related impurities were established. no new process-related 
 impurities were identified in the finished product when compared to the active substance. 
 potency reference standard 
 the 8th international standard for fviii concentrate (nibsc 07/350) is used as primary reference 
 standard. a product-specific working reference standard was established which was calibrated against 
 the 8th international standard for fviii concentrate (nibsc 07/350). 
 a consistent potency declaration from early clinical trials throughout the commercial life cycle is in place.</p><p>
 the general strategy for the establishment, the calibration and the stability monitoring of the reference 
 standards (prs and wrs) is discussed in more detail in the active substance section.</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>the stability of the finished product was investigated for all strengths. long-term stability studies for commercial scale batches at +5°c, +25°c, 30°c and +40°c (stress condition) were performed in order to 
 monitor the physical, chemical and biological integrity of the finished product over time. temperature 
 shift studies were also included. 
 the batches included into the stability studies used the final container closure system. the container 
 closure system consists of 6 ml and 10 ml type i glass vials and a bromobutyl rubber stopper. the 
 stoppers are secured by combination caps consisting of an aluminum crimp cap with a concentric hole and 
 an integrated polypropylene plastic disc. the packaging materials for storage of the finished product are 
 in compliance with ph. eur. and usp requirements and are suitable for the intended use. the silicone oil 
 compatibility of closures with the product has been discussed.

 the comparability of the performance of the manufacturing processes of the finished product at the pilot

  pharmacodynamic efficacy of rviii-singlechain in preclinical tox species using 
 thrombin generation.</header><p>the aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic efficacy of rviii-singlechain in plasma of cd rats. the thrombin generation assay was selected as read-out for haemostatic efficacy, since it was 
 shown to be a sensitive model discriminating pharmacological activity of fviii products in a range of fviii 
 concentrations of 10-320 % of the norm. 
 rviii-singlechain was spiked at concentrations of 1 to 30 iu/ml based on chromogenic fviii activity to 
 plasma derived from female cd rats. pharmacodynamic activity was determined based on a thrombin 
 generation assay using a calibrated automated thrombogram. coagulation was triggered using the 
 ppp-reagent. the tga variables peak height, time to peak, lagtime, and endogenous thrombin potential 
 were subjected to statistical analysis. 
 rviii-singlechain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics effect on thrombin generation 
 compared to the negative control. peak height increased and time to peak shortened 
 concentration-dependently and statistically significantly with increasing concentrations of 
 rviii-singlechain up to 10 iu/ml. there was no concentration-dependent effect of rviii-singlechain on 
 lagtime, and no effect of rviii-singlechain on etp. 
 rviii-singlechain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics effect on thrombin generation 
 in plasma of cd rats, measured as an increase of thrombin peak and a reduction of time to peak,</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 the results demonstrated that rviii-singlechain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic 
 effect in plasma derived from cynomolgus monkeys based on thrombin generation as characterized by an 
 increase in thrombin peak and etp and a reduction in time to peak supporting the cynomolgus monkey as

 study: pharmacodynamic comparison of rviii-singlechain  and advate regarding 
 thromboelastography and thrombin generation parameters following a single intravenous 
 injection to haemophilia a mice.</header><p>the aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effect of rviii-singlechain and the marketed full length rfviii product advate on thromboelastography and thrombin generation parameters 
 ex vivo in fviii deficient whole blood (teg/tem) or plasma (tga) using fviii ko mice. 
 both rfviii products, rviii-singlechain and advate, were administered intravenously at dose levels of 20 
 iu/kg according to chromogenic fviii activity (in house measurements for rviii-singlechain, nominal 
 activity for advate) 15 min prior to blood sampling. pharmacodynamic activity of the test substances was 
 tested using thromboelastography/thromboelastometry to assess the viscoelasticity of whole blood and 
 to monitor bleeding management in relation to blood clotting quality and thrombin generation in presence 
 of pathromtin sl and phospholipids (0.5 mm phospholipid-tgt). 
 the pharmacodynamic activity of rviii-singlechain did not differ significantly from the marketed 
 recombinant full-length fviii product advate and the overall hemodynamic capacity of rviii-singlechain 
 appears to be comparable to advate when dosed according to chromogenic fviii activity.</p></section><section><header>study: pharmacodynamic comparison of rviii-singlechain and advate regarding aptt following a single intravenous injection to haemophilia a mice.</header><p>the aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effect of rviii-singlechain and the marketed full length rfviii product advate in an aptt 
 ex vivo test using fviii deficient plasma from fviii ko mice. additionally, fviii activity was determined in the plasma samples using the chromogenic and the 
 one-stage clotting fviii assay to confirm exposure. 
 both products were administered intravenously at a dose level of 20 iu/kg to fviii ko mice 15 min prior 
 to blood sampling. they were administered for the rviii-singlechain group according to chromogenic 
 fviii activity and for the advate group according to nominal activity. fviii activity (clotting and 
 chromogen) was determined to confirm exposure, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) was 
 analysed as a measure for pharmacodynamic activity (correction of hemostasis). 
 the results obtained for both rfviii products for the activated partial thromboplastin time, the clotting 
 fviii activity, and the chromogenic fviii activity compared to the control group demonstrated a clear 
 effect on the endpoints measured. both test items could restore the fviii coagulation parameter aptt to 
 a comparable degree. at the same time, fviii activity increased significantly in plasma, thereby 
 confirming exposure. the increase in fviii activity was slightly larger for rviii-singlechain as compared</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 to advate in the chromogenic fviii assay and smaller in the clotting fviii assay indicating that changes in aptt are in line with chromogenic fviii activity, but correlate less stringent with clotting fviii activity.</p></section><section><header>studies: (a) correction of hemostasis in fviii ko mice following treatment with rviii-singlechain, helixate, refacto af and humate p and (b): correction of hemostasis in 
 fviii ko mice following treatment with rviii-singlechain, helixate, refacto af, advate and 
 humate p.</header><p>the primary aim of these studies was to establish a dose-response relationship regarding the haemostatic efficacy of rviii-singlechain in haemophilia a mice (fviii ko mice). in addition, effects of 
 rviii-singlechain were compared with marketed, clinically relevant, rfviii products, i.e. the full-length 
 proteins helixate and advate, the b-domain-deleted protein refacto af, and the plasma-derived human 
 coagulation fviii/von willebrand factor complex concentrate humate p at dose levels between 1 iu/kg 
 and 150 iu/kg fviii activity, except for humate p (41 iu/kg). as a secondary aim, aptt was determined 
 in all test groups at the end of the observation period. 
 the fviii dose was determined by a chromogenic assay. it is noteworthy, that according to a one-stage 
 clotting assay, the dose of rviii-singlechain was about 2.8 fold lower than that of helixate, about 1.6 fold 
 lower than that of refacto af and about 2.3 fold lower than that of advate.</p><p>
 the rfviii concentrate rviii-singlechain demonstrated its haemostatic efficacy in haemophilia a mice. 
 thereby, the results obtained for the haemostatic efficacy differ slightly depending on the assay system 
 used for dose adjustment chromogenic fviii assay system vs. one-stage-clotting fviii assay system).</p></section><section><header>secondary pharmacodynamic studies</header><p>no secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).</p></section><section><header>safety pharmacology programme</header><p>in accordance with the ich guideline s6, the safety pharmacology investigation concerning measurements of cardiovascular variables was included in the 28 day repeat-dose toxicity study in 
 monkeys. in addition, the assessment of potential neurobehavioral effects of rviii-singlechain was 
 integrated in the subchronic repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. a further in depth investigation of potential 
 effects of rviii-singlechain on hemodynamic and electrophysiological parameters was conducted in dogs 
 and monkeys , whereas the impact on respiratory variables was assessed in dogs only. during these 
 studies, rviii-singlechain was administered i.v. at a cumulative dose of up to 1550 iu/kg either under 
 anaesthetized conditions or in conscious telemetered animals.</p></section><section><header>study: rviii-singlechain: toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to cd rats for 4 weeks followed by a 14 day recovery period.</header><p>potential effects of rviii-singlechain on the central nervous system were assessed as part of a repeat toxicity study in cd rats following intravenous (bolus) administration over a period of up to 4 weeks.</p><p>

 overall, the electrophysiology of the heart was considered unaffected by rviii-singlechain treatment. 
 there were no obvious dose-related effects seen from the observations or the numerical data derived 
 from the electrocardiograms recorded during the course of the study. blood pressure and pulse rate 
 measurements were considered to be unaffected by rviii-singlechain treatment.</p></section><section><header>study: rviii-singlechain: effects on general haemodynamics and respiratory variables in anaesthetized beagle dogs (intravenous infusion administration).</header><p>the potential effects of rviii-singlechain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic endpoints as well as respiratory parameters were assessed in anaesthetised dogs following a cumulative administration of 
 increasing doses of rviii-singlechain. two groups of dogs, each comprising 2 females and 2 males, 
 received dose volumes of vehicle (0.9% w/v saline) equivalent to the volumes required to administer 
 rviii-singlechain at dose levels of 50, 250 and 1250 iu/kg resulting in a cumulative dose of 1550 iu/kg 
 rviii-singlechain. the test substances were administered at three consecutive intervals of 45 min 
 duration comprising 30 min of test item administration followed by a period of 15 min between the end of 
 one infusion to the start of the next infusion. 
 overall, the pharmacologically relevant falls in cardiovascular parameters after treatment with 
 rviii-singlechain (1250 iu/kg) were considered unlikely to be directly attributable to the active 
 ingredient of rviii-singlechain. to confirm this hypothesis, follow-up studies were conducted in a 
 conscious dog and monkeys under telemetric conditions</p></section><section><header>study: telemetric evaluation of cardiovascular effects in the conscious beagle dog (intravenous infusion administration).</header><p>the potential effects of rviii-singlechain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were assessed in a telemetered dog following a cumulative administration of increasing doses of</p><p>
 rviii-singlechain. one telemetered, male dog received increasing dose volumes vehicle (dilution buffer 
 for rviii-singlechain) equivalent to the volumes required to administer rviii-singlechain or doses of 50, 
 250 and 1250 iu/kg resulting in a cumulative dose of 1550 iu/kg rviii-singlechain. rviii-singlechain 
 and the vehicle, dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain, were administered on separate days using the same 
 dosing regimen as in the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs, thus test substances were 
 administered at three consecutive intervals of 45 min duration. endpoints assessed were similar to those 
 investigated during the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs. electrophysiological and 
 hemodynamic variables were monitored for at least 90 min prior to the target time for commencement of 
 dosing and continued for at least 20 h following the start of the first intravenous infusion on each of the 
 two test sessions. 
 following intravenous administration of the first two infusions of either dilution buffer for 
 rviii-singlechain, or test item rviii-singlechain containing active fviii, when applied at dose levels of 
 50 and 250 iu/kg, some differences were noted in cardiovascular parameters, notably for blood pressure 
 and lvp parameters. since recorded values were generally lower following rviii-singlechain 
 administration the results were therefore not considered to be attributable to treatment with the active 
 ingredient of rviii-singlechain.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 27/103</p><p> 
 similarly to observations made in the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs, following intravenous administration of the third infusions of either dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain or 
 rviii-singlechain at the dose level of 1250 iu/kg, changes were observed in arterial blood pressure 
 (systolic, diastolic and mean), pr and qt intervals, heart rate, lvsp, lvedp, dp/dtmax and dp/dtmin. 
 these changes were of a similar magnitude and duration after infusion of both, dilution buffer for 
 rviii-singlechain and rviii-singlechain (1250 iu/kg), and were therefore not considered to be 
 attributable to treatment with the active ingredient of rviii-singlechain. 
 no effects were observed on the ecg (lead ii) waveform morphology after treatment with either dilution 
 buffer for rviii-singlechain or rviii-singlechain, throughout the study period. 
 during the first two infusions of either dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain or rviii-singlechain at dose 
 levels of 50 and 250 iu/kg no adverse clinical signs were observed in the dog. however, during the third 
 infusion of dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain, behavioural and clinical signs resembling a pseudo 
 allergic reaction such as swelling and reddening of the extremities and the face, and pale gums were 
 observed, which necessitated the halting of the third and final infusion after 23 min for reasons of animal 
 welfare. 
 alike, during the third infusion of rviii-singlechain (1250 iu/kg), clinical signs of a pseudoallergic 
 reaction such as swelling around the eyes, face, neck, ears and forelimbs and reddening of the skin) were 
 observed at a comparable time during the infusion (approximately +20 min), but the infusion continued 
 until its scheduled completion after veterinary advice, and since the apparent effects were reversible as 
 observed during the previous test session when investigating dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain. 
 the coincidence of timing and duration of the clinical signs observed after treatment with both dilution 
 buffer for rviii-singlechain and rviii-singlechain strongly suggests that the observed effects were not 
 directly related to treatment with the test item rviii-singlechain, but are related to a component of the 
 dilution buffer for rviii-singlechain, which was common in the applied test items during both test 
 sessions. 
 taking into account the results obtained from the former study using anaesthetized dogs as well as the 
 behavioural effects seen in this study using telemetered dogs, observed effects are believed to be due to 
 the excipient ps80 of the rviii-singlechain dilution buffer for which dogs represent a notably sensitive 
 species. therefore, observed effects were not considered to be directly related to treatment with the 
 active ingredient, the test item rviii-singlechain per se. the assumption of the ps80-induced 
 cardiovascular and behavioural effects in the particularly sensitive species dog is supported by results 
 obtained in the subsequent safety pharmacology study using telemetered monkeys, mimicking the dosing 
 regimen of the two former studies in anaesthetized and telemetered beagle dogs as well as the subchronic 
 toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. the lack of any treatment related clinical signs and cardiovascular 
 or behavioural effects found in studies using cynomolgus monkeys, indicates that the dog is likely to be 
 the more sensitive species to ps80, compared to the monkey. thus, observed effects were not considered 
 to be directly attributable to treatment with rviii-singlechain.</p></section><section><header>study: telemetric evaluation of cardiovascular effects in the conscious cynomolgus monkey (intravenous infusion administration).</header><p>the potential effects of rviii-singlechain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were assessed in telemetered cynomolgus monkeys following a cumulative administration of increasing doses

    methods of analysis</header><p>for measuring fviii activity in plasma, two different test principles were used, one using a chromogenic assay (chs) and one a one-stage (os) clotting assay.</p></section><section><header>absorption study: rviii-singlechain: pk study and tool antibody production in cynomolgus monkeys</header><p>the objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of rviii-singlechain following a single intravenous dose at levels of 50 iu/kg and 250 iu/kg (phase a). in 
 addition, the systemic exposure following i.v. administration of rviii-singlechain was compared to that of 
 marketed recombinant human fviii products, i.e. helixate and refacto af. the objective of phase b was 
 – after the initial intravenous prime - to elicit a humoral immune response following repeated 
 subcutaneous administration in combination with an adjuvant, for the purpose of harvesting species 
 specific anti-product antibodies as an analytical tool for subsequent pivotal glp-toxicity studies. 
 furthermore, appearance of an immune response against rviii-singlechain compared to refacto af and 
 helixate, respectively, was investigated.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 during the study, clinical condition, body weight, haematology, blood chemistry, bioanalytical, organ weight and macroscopic pathology investigations were undertaken. 
 during the phase a, rviii-singlechain displayed similar pharmacokinetic properties when compared with 
 those of refacto af but exhibited a slightly lower clearance when compared to helixate. in addition after 
 comparison of the 50 iu/kg dose groups with those of the 250 iu/kg dose groups the results show that for 
 both rviii-singlechain and helixate approximate dose proportionality holds in particular for those 
 parameters that do not involve extrapolation, i.e. c
 max,incr,obs , cmax,incr and auc24h.</p><p>in terms of safety it could be concluded that single intravenous administrations of rviii-singlechain or 
 the other fviii concentrates (helixate or refacto af) at a dosage of 250 iu/kg to cynomolgus monkeys 
 was well tolerated and did not exhibit any adverse effects of treatment with rviii-singlechain. 
 during phase b, active immunization after biweekly repeated subcutaneous administration of 
 rviii-singlechain, helixate or refacto af, when administered in combination with an adjuvant at a 
 dosage of 350 iu/kg, elicited a fulminant anti-fviii-antibody immune response in all animals but was not 
 well tolerated. under conditions of an active immunization, repeated treatment with heterologous human 
 fviii products resulted in a strong neutralizing anti-fviii antibody response, which was significantly 
 cross reactive with, and hence inhibitory to endogenous fviii and elicited haemophilia a like symptoms to 
 a greater or lesser degree in all animals treated with rviii-singlechain, helixate or refacto af.</p></section><section><header>study: rviii-singlechain: pk study in cynomolgus monkeys</header><p>the objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of rviii-singlechain following a single intravenous dose of 250 iu/kg. in addition, the systemic exposure following i.v. administration of 
 rviii-singlechain was compared to that of marketed recombinant human fviii product, i.e. advate. prior 
 to plasma sample analysis venous blood samples were collected from all animals at the following 
 schedule: pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h post dose. 
 following a single intravenous bolus injection, rviii-singlechain and the comparator formulation advate 
 were well tolerated at a dosage of 250 iu/kg, with no clinical signs or reactions to treatment observed, nor 
 any injection site observations considered associated with treatment. 
 individual fviii activities were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay. corresponding fviii 
 plasma levels were calculated using standard human plasma as calibrator, which is calibrated from the 
 manufacturer against who standard material. 100% of norm corresponds to 1 iu/ml fviii. resulting 
 values were above baseline, following administration of rviii-singlechain and advate up to 24 h post 
 dose in all animals. generally, for each of the formulations there were no notable differences in the 
 pharmacokinetics of fviii between sexes. 
 following administration of rviii-singlechain, the maximum activity of fviii was similar to that following 
 administration of advate. 
 plasma levels of fviii activity declined from a maximum at the first sampling time in an apparent 
 bi-exponential manner with a terminal half-life ranging between 10-15 h for rviii-singlechain and 
 ranging between 4.6-4.7 h for advate. 
 the mean c
 0 value following administration of rviii-singlechain was similar to that following administration of advate. however, the mean auc
 t value (% of the norm*h/ml) following administration of rviii-singlechain was 1.7-fold higher than that after administration of advate. when comparing 
 exposure extrapolated to infinity (auc), fviii activity was approximately 2.3 fold greater following 
 administration of rviii-singlechain to that following administration of advate.</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 30/103</p><p> 
 accordingly, the cl value (iu/%*h) following administration of rviii-singlechain was approximately 2.2-fold higher compared to advate. the mean terminal half-life following administration of 
 rviii-singlechain was approximately 2.7-fold longer than that after administration of advate.</p></section><section><header>study: pharmacokinetic evaluation of rfviii/rviii-singlechain, helixate, refacto af and advate in fviii ko mice</header><p>the aim of this study was to establish a comparative pharmacokinetic analysis of rviii-singlechain in haemophilia a mice (fviii ko mice) and thereby compare the profile head-to-head with other clinically 
 relevant, recombinant human fviii products, i.e. the full length protein helixate and advate and the 
 b-domain-deleted protein refacto af.</p><p>
 all test articles were injected intravenously at a clinically relevant dose of 100 iu/kg adjusted according 
 to the one-stage clotting system activity of the four different test items. the subsequent determination of 
 fviii activity in plasma was performed by the chromogenic assay as well as the one-stage clotting system 
 at different time points after administration of the four different test items. 
 the overall pharmacokinetic properties of rviii-singlechain did not differ largely from the other marketed 
 recombinant human fviii products helixate, refacto af or advate when keeping the analytical system 
 the same by adjusting the applied dose and measuring the respective fviii:c plasma levels with either 
 the chromogenic system or the one-stage clotting system. hence this particular set up may reflect and 
 predict the human pharmacokinetics and in turn the haemostatic efficacy in haemophilia a individuals 
 most appropriately. the favourable pk profile of rviii-singlechain compared to other recombinant fviii 
 concentrates in haemophilia a mice is consistent with the observations obtained in a cynomolgus monkey 
 study when administering rviii-singlechain at doses of 50 iu/kg and 250 iu/kg.</p></section><section><header>distribution</header><p>distribution studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).</p></section><section><header>metabolism</header><p>metabolism studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).</p></section><section><header>excretion</header><p>no separate elimination or excretion studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetic drug interactions</header><p>no nonclinical drug interaction studies were performed.</p></section><section><header>other pharmacokinetic studies</header><p>no other pk studies have been performed.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4.

 thrombosis incidence and thrombus dry weight were then used as parameters for evaluation and 
 comparison. in the present thrombogenicity study, the potential pro-thrombogenic effects of 
 rviii-singlechain were evaluated at doses of 150, 300, 500 and 1000 iu/kg, when given via the i.v. route 
 to 6 rabbits (3 females / 3 males) per dose and group. twelve rabbits (6 females / 6 males) received 
 physiological saline and acted as placebo group (negative control). feiba nf 500 (factor eight bypassing 
 activity) was included in the study to act as a positive control, since it contains activated and 
 non-activated factors of the prothrombin complex, which are able to activate the blood clotting cascade at</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 jugular veins after venous stasis was assessed. 
 rviii-singlechain showed only a minimal prothrombotic potential at the highest administered dose of

 discussion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>pharmacology concerning pharmacology one in-vivo pharmacodynamic study was performed in coagulation factor viii 
 deficient mice (fviii knockout mice). here, the i.v. administration of rviii-singlechain, respectively, 
 revealed a significant dose-dependent reduction of total blood loss, time to haemostasis and activated 
 partial thromboplastin time (aptt) compared to the control group. the effects were comparable to other 
 fviii products, i.e. helixate, refacto and advate. 
 originally, safety pharmacology investigations in terms of cardiovascular variables were included in the 
 28 repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys. here, the electrophysiology of the heart as well as blood 
 pressure and pulse rate measurements were considered unaffected by afstyla treatment. 
 the investigation of potential neuro-behavioural effects of afstyla was integrated in the 28 repeat-dose 
 toxicity study in rats. there were no treatment related changes to the clinical signs observed during the 
 irwin assessment. further, there were no macroscopic or histopathological changes observed which were 
 considered to be indicative of an effect on the central nervous system. 
 a further in depth investigation of potential effects of afstyla on hemodynamic and electrophysiological 
 parameters was conducted in dogs and monkeys, whereas the potential impact on respiratory variables 
 was assessed in dogs only. 
 unexpectedly, during the study conducted in anaesthetized beagle dogs statistically significant and 
 pharmacologically relevant falls in cardiovascular parameters, i.e. arterial blood pressure, lvsp, lvedp, 
 cardiac output and stroke volume, following intravenous administration of the third infusion of afstyla at 
 the highest dose level of 1250 iu/kg were recorded, which had not been observed following treatment 
 with 0.9% w/v saline. however, in the study using treatment of telemetered monkeys with either 0.9% 
 saline or dilution buffer for afstyla, when used as placebo control and vehicle control, respectively in 
 comparison with afstyla per se revealed no treatment related clinical signs on any of the behavioural or 
 cardiovascular variables at cumulative doses of 1550 iu/kg. as it is known that dogs are ps80 sensitive, 
 the cardiovascular and respiratory effects observed in study in dogs and the behavioural effects seen in 
 the subsequent study in telemetered dogs, were considered to be due to the excipient ps80 of the 
 rviii-singlechain dilution buffer, and not directly related to the treatment with the active ingredient. 
 based on the mechanism of action of rviii-singlechain, representing a human blood coagulation factor, 
 no secondary pharmacodynamic effects were expected. there were also no indications for secondary</p><p> assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 35/103</p><p> 
 pharmacodynamic effects observed during primary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacological or toxicological investigations. this was considered acceptable. 
 pharmacokinetics 
 in monkeys, afstyla displayed similar pharmacokinetic properties when compared with those of refacto 
 af but exhibited a slightly lower clearance when compared to helixate. in addition after comparison of the 
 50 iu/kg dose groups with those of the 250 iu/kg dose groups the results show that for both afstyla and 
 helixate approximate dose proportionality holds in particular for those parameters that do not involve 
 extrapolation, i.e. c
 max,incr,obs , cmax,incr and auc24h. in a second study in monkeys pk of 250 iu/kg, afstyla was compared to that of advate. here, the mean terminal half-life following administration of afstyla was 
 approximately 2.7-fold longer than that after administration of advate. 
 in fviii deficient mice the overall pharmacokinetic properties of afstyla were slightly superior, but did not 
 differ largely from the other marketed recombinant human fviii concentrates helixate, refacto af or 
 advate when adjusting the applied dose of afstyla and measuring the respective fviii:c plasma levels by 
 the identical analytical test system, either the chromogenic system or the one-stage clotting system, and 
 comparator properties were analysed according to their labelled potency dose. 
 overall, the pharmacokinetic studies submitted are considered sufficient and appropriate to support 
 marketing authorisation. 
 toxicology 
 single intravenous (bolus) injection of afstyla at doses up to 1500 iu/kg was well tolerated in the rat with 
 no findings indicative of adverse toxicity and no irritation at the site of injection. similarly single 
 intravenous bolus injection of asftyla at doses up to 1500 iu/kg was well tolerated in cynomolgus 
 monkeys with no effects observed. accordingly, for both studies the noael was considered to be 1500 
 iu/kg. 
 repeat-dose toxicity of afstyla was also evaluated in rats and monkeys. in rats the administration of 
 afstyla by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses of 50, 250 or 1250 iu/kg/day for 6 or 28 days was well 
 tolerated with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity. an immune response resulting in the formation of 
 antibodies against afstyla was apparent within the afstyla treated groups after 16 and 28 days of 
 treatment, but there are no indications that this prevented an assessment of the toxicity of afstyla. under 
 the conditions of this study, the noael was considered to be 1250 iu/kg. 
 in monkeys afstyla was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 150 and 500 iu/kg on 28 consecutive 
 days. administration of afstyla by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses up to 500 iu/kg was well 
 tolerated. an immune response resulting in the formation of antibodies against afstyla was apparent 
 within the afstyla treated groups after 13 and 28 days of treatment. under the conditions of this study, 
 the noael was considered to be the highest dose tested, i.e. 500 iu/kg.</p><p>
 genotoxicity studies were not submitted as the active components of rviii-singlechain are recombinant 
 counterparts of naturally occurring human plasma proteins. as mutagenic effects of fviii were not 
 expected, since there is no direct interaction with dna to anticipate damage of dna or interaction with 
 dna binding proteins, no studies with regard to the mutagenic potential of rviii-singlechain have been 
 performed. 
 carcinogenicity studies were not submitted in accordance with ich s6 r1 and as the active component of 
 rviii-singlechain is a recombinant counterpart of naturally occurring human plasma proteins, 
 carcinogenicity studies are not regarded to be required and have not been performed.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 a local tolerance study was performed in rabbits. here intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous injection of afstyla was well tolerated with no local or systemic sign of reaction to treatment. macro-pathological 
 and histological findings were considered to be due to the administration procedure. furthermore, local 
 tolerance investigations were included in the single dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies (in rats and 
 monkeys) showing good tolerability of afstyla following i.v. administration. 
 a thrombogenicity study was conducted to evaluate the prothrombotic potential of afstyla using the 
 modified wessler test (as described by giles, 1980). here, afstyla showed only a minimal prothrombotic 
 potential at the highest administered dose of 1000 iu/kg with no statistically significant effects at the 
 lower doses of 150, 300 or 500 iu/kg, leading to the designation of a noael of 500 iu/kg. 
 afstyla is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor viii. it is

 a factor 1.8 [x] (x defined as os fviii activity) most closely aligns os activity results with chs activity results. the information of discrepancy between os and chs assay results and the use of a correction 
 factor is given in posology section 4.2 of the smpc. the conversion factor was changed from 1.8 to 2 in 
 order to facilitate the use in clinical practice and to align with authorisation recommendations in other 
 countries. both conversion factors 1.8 and 2 are within the currently accepted range of variability in 
 clinical practice and provide an equally acceptable value to monitor post-infusion plasma samples in 
 patients treated with rviii-singlechain.pharmacokinetics of afstyla (lonoctocog alfa) was evaluated in a 
 total of 130 previously treated male patients suffering from severe haemophilia a (&lt;1%) in two pivotal 
 studies, i.e. csl627_1001 (adults and adolescents) and csl627_3002 (children). 
 absorption studies were not conducted since the route of administration is i.v.; no distribution studies 
 were performed since afstyla contains a recombinant endogenous fviii protein and metabolism, 
 elimination or excretion studies are not applicable since rfviii is an endogenous protein that is 
 catabolized via normal physiological pathways. no drug-drug interaction studies were conducted, since 
 no drug interaction is expected given the close comparability of afstyla to the native human fviii. these 
 omissions are considered to be acceptable. 
 in study 1001 part 1 pk of lonoctocog alfa was compared with pk of advate in 27 patients. in brief, pk of 
 rfviii-single chain and advate are comparable. rfviii-single chain revealed slightly higher t½ and auc 
 values whereas the clearance was somewhat reduced in comparison to advate. however, these 
 differences are not considered clinically relevant. the applicant did not claim different posology 
 recommendations but used the posology wording as suggested by the core spc, which is supported. 
 according to the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor viii and ix products, the 
 applicant compared initial and repeat pk. based on the data provided it is agreed to the applicant that 
 there are no obvious differences between initial and repeat pk.</p><p>
 as requested by the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor viii and ix products, a pk 
 comparison of high- and low-strength formulations of rviii-singlechain was performed. furthermore, 
 there was no clinically relevant effect of rviii-singlechain lot on the pk of fviii following either single or 
 repeat iv injections at a dose of 50 iu/kg. 
 in terms of paediatric patients pk data are available from 39 patients (20 in the age group 0 to &lt;6 years 
 and 19 in the age group ≥6 to &lt;12 years). in adolescents i.e. ≥12 to &lt;18 years, pk was evaluated in 10 
 patients. overall, pk data in these age groups is considered sufficient.</p><p>
 no pk data in the elderly were generated as no subjects &gt; 65 years were enrolled in any of the clinical 
 studies. this is in line with the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor viii and ix 
 products. 
 population pk simulations support the proposed prophylactic dosing regimen of 20 to 50 iu/kg 
 rviii-singlechain 2 times weekly and 3 times weekly as the simulations predict that the majority of 
 subjects, i.e. approximately 54% to 98% would maintain their trough total activity at &gt;1% at all times. in 
 the younger children (&lt;6yrs) in the lowest dose groups 20 iu/kg 2 times weekly, less than 50% achieve 
 fviii trough levels &gt;1%. accordingly, the applicant proposed to increase the recommended starting dose 
 from 20 to 50 iu/kg 2 to 3 times weekly to 30 to 50 iu/kg 2 to 3 times weekly for children &lt;12yrs. 
 no specific pharmacodynamics studies were conducted as the pd effects of fviii are closely associated 
 with its pk parameters. this was considered acceptable.</p><p> assessment report</p><p>

 haemostatic efficacy 4-point scale</p><p> 
 to estimate the rate of treatment success, the numerator included the number of bleeding 
 episodes treated with rviii-singlechain and rated as “excellent” or “good”, and the denominator 
 included all treated bleeding episodes. in the primary analysis, treated bleeding episodes with 
 missing investigator ratings were counted as treatment failures. in the 2 sensitivity analyses, 
 bleeding episodes with missing investigator ratings were either excluded from the calculation, or 
 counted as treatment successes.</p><p>
 • routine prophylaxis: annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (asbr), comparison of on-demand regimen to prophylaxis regimen 
 • perioperative prophylaxis: rate of treatment success during the surgical substudy defined as an investigator rating of “excellent” or “good” on a 4-point efficacy evaluation of surgical treatment 
 scale</p><p>
 the secondary and other efficacy endpoints were: 
 • control and prevention of bleeding episodes: number of injections of rviii-singlechain required to achieve hemostasis, rate of treatment success for major bleeding episodes defined as a rating 
 of “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
 4-point scale, and consumption of rviii-singlechain 
 • routine prophylaxis: abr and consumption of rviii-singlechain • perioperative prophylaxis: consumption of rviii-singlechain during surgical prophylaxis, predicted and estimated blood loss during surgery, predicted and actual transfusion requirements 
 during surgery, change in hemoglobin levels between baseline, intra-operation and 
 post-operation 
 the primary safety endpoint was the incidence of fviii inhibitors associated with the use of 
 rviii-singlechain. safety was also assessed by adverse events (aes), serious adverse events (saes), 
 local tolerability at the site of injection, laboratory safety parameters, measurement of non-inhibitory 
 anti-drug antibodies (adas) and antibodies against cho host cell proteins, vital signs before and after 
 injection, and physical examination.</p></section><section><header>• sample size</header><p>approximately 30 subjects were to be enrolled into part 1 of the study, to ensure 26 evaluable subjects for the pk comparison (all subjects receiving comparator first, then afstyla).</p><p>under the assumption that the

 to ensure at least 104 subjects evaluable for inhibitor development, approximately 100 additional subjects were to be enrolled in part 3. it was assumed that at most 2 subjects out of 104 would develop 
 an inhibitor during the study. this would maintain an upper 95%-ci within an acceptable upper bound of 
 6.8% (fda requirement).</p></section><section><header>• randomisation</header><p>n/a</p></section><section><header>• blinding (masking)</header><p>n/a</p></section><section><header>• statistical methods</header><p>inhibitor development, haemostatic efficacy and bleeding events were key parameter of interest in study cls627_1001.</p><p>
 inhibitor formation was defined as any inhibitor (≥ 0.6 bu/ml) identified and confirmed by re-testing. 
 for estimating the inhibitor incidence, the numerator included all subjects with inhibitors regardless of 
 eds to rviii-singlechain; and the denominator included subjects with at least 50 eds plus subjects with 
 less than 50 eds but with inhibitors. a 2-sided 95% exact ci for the incidence of inhibitor formation was 
 calculated. if zero inhibitors were observed, then a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit was calculated. 
 sas’ freq procedure was applied to produce an exact ci, which used the clopper-pearson ci as the 
 default method. success was achieved if the upper confidence limit was less than the acceptable upper 
 limit of 6.8%. 
 the rate of successfully treated bleeding episodes (i.e. investigator assessment of ‘excellent / good’) was 
 calculated including the corresponding 95% ci. the 95%-ci was calculated applying a repeated 
 measures model using generalized estimating equations and an independent correlation structure to 
 account for within-subject correlation. the following treated bleeds were considered treatment failures: 
 investigator assessment of moderate/ poor/none; treated with products other than rfviii-singlechain; 
 having missing investigator ratings.</p><p>
 the asbr defined by: 365.25*(number of spontaneous bleeding episodes) / (observed treatment period 
 of interest). 
 (only spontaneous bleeding episodes requiring treatment outside the pk and surgical periods were 
 included). the asbr was presented for various subgroups by means of descriptive statistical 
 characteristics. the primary comparison of interest for asbr was the comparison between the prophylaxis 
 arm and the on- demand arm. a poisson regression model was used to test the null hypothesis of no 
 difference regarding asbr between both groups. the corresponding prophylaxis/on demand ratio with 
 95% ci was also presented. as a secondary analysis, the asbr with prophylaxis treatment on study 
 csl627-1001 was compared to that of an on-demand/prevention historical control (data from biostate 
 study cslct-bio-07-47); again applying poisson regression. 
 a hierarchical approach was used to deal with the multiplicity resulting from the assessment of the key 
 parameter: 
 the procedure started with inhibitor development.</p><p>if the upper limit of the 97.5%-ci for the risk of 
 inhibitor development was greater than 6.8%, the study would have failed and further testing stopped.

 episodes. if the lower limit of the 95% ci for the observed rate of successfully treated bleeds would be less than 70%, then the study would have failed on this endpoint and further testing would be stopped. 
 otherwise, testing proceeded to the asbr. if a test of the null hypothesis of no difference between the 
 prophylaxis and the on-demand groups was not rejected at the two-sided 0.05 level, then the study would 
 have failed on this endpoint and further testing stopped.</p></section><section><header>results</header></section><section><header>• participant flow

 regimens were treated with a rviii-singlechain dose prescribed by the investigator. the desired fviii 
 level for the treatment of a bleeding episode was based on the recommendations of the wfh (wfh, 
 2012). 
 for the prophylaxis regimen, subjects were to receive rviii-singlechain at a dose of 15 to 50 iu/kg every 
 second day or 2 to 3 times weekly, or at a dose and frequency determined by the investigator based on 
 historical fviii dosing and available pk data. subjects were not allowed to switch from on-demand to 
 prophylaxis regimen or vice versa, but dose adjustments were permitted at the discretion of the 
 investigator. in addition to their on-demand or prophylaxis regimen, subjects could receive preventative 
 doses (eg, doses given prior to an activity or minor procedure to prevent or reduce potential bleeding 
 episodes) or additional doses (eg, doses taken beyond the need to control hemostasis). these doses 
 contributed to an ed and consumption of fviii, but did not contribute to the efficacy evaluation of the 
 treatment of a bleeding episode. subjects were to be treated for at least 50 eds until there was a total of 
 25 subjects 0 to &lt; 6 years and 25 subjects</p><p>

 “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 4-point scale 
 to estimate the rate of treatment success, the numerator included the number of bleeding episodes 
 treated with rviii-singlechain and rated as 
 “excellent” or “good”, and the denominator included all treated bleeding episodes. in the primary analysis, treated bleeding episodes with missing investigator 
 ratings were counted as treatment failures. in the sensitivity analyses, bleeding episodes with missing 
 investigator ratings were either excluded from the calculation, or counted as treatment success. 
 the secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
 • control and prevention of bleeding episodes: number of injections of rviii-singlechain required to achieve hemostasis, and consumption of rviii-singlechain 
 • routine prophylaxis: abr during on-demand and during prophylaxis treatment, and consumption of rviii-singlechain 
 other secondary endpoints were:</p><p>
 • pk parameters for rviii-singlechain the secondary safety endpoints: 
 • occurrence of inhibitor formation to rviii-singlechain evaluated from the time of first rviii-singlechain dose through the end-of-study visit 
 • safety measures including aes, saes, local tolerability, laboratory safety parameters, measurement of non-inhibitory adas and antibodies against cho host cell proteins, physical 
 examination, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate)</p></section><section><header>• sample size</header><p>the determination of sample size was based on the ema guideline for recombinant and human plasma-derived factor viii products in children &lt; 12 years of age [ema, 2011]. this guideline requires a

 the main changes to the study conduct as a result of the global substantial protocol amendments were as 
 follows: 
 protocol amendment 1 was issued on 21 may 2013: extend the duration of subject study participation to allow at least 50 eds; increase cohort size of subjects screened for participation; distinguish lab assessments performed by local or central 
 laboratories; reiterate the recording of actual dosing rather than nominal dosing; add assessment for 
 cho antibodies; update the definitions of overdose, treatment compliance, retention of samples, and 
 haemophilia social history and activity level; clarify end-of-study procedures; define preventative dosing 
 and additional dosing; collect additional subject information including blood group and gene defect of 
 haemophilia a; clarify serum chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters to be collected; clarify 
 statistical analyses and methods;update idmc responsibilities 
 protocol amendment 2 was issued on 28 march 2014: incorporate the non-substantial amendment change for subjects not returning unused medication at every visit; incorporate a change in the pk collection time points as recommended by fda; update idmc

 however, the percentage of prophylaxis subjects requiring

 a total of 50 additional rviii-singlechain doses were administered (ie, doses beyond the need to control 
 hemostasis to prevent rebleeding and promote hematoma resorption), with a median of 2 additional

 design 
 this is an international, multicenter, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and 
 pk profile of rviii-singlechain in pediatric patients with severe haemophilia a (fviii 
 concentration &lt;1%). subjects received either on-demand or prophylaxis treatment with 
 rviii-singlechain at a dose to be determined by the investigator. haemostatic efficacy 
 was assessed by the subject/caregiver and the investigator who assessed overall efficacy 
 by a 4-point scale.

 hypothesis 
 the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of rviii-singlechain in the 
 treatment of major and minor bleeding events based on the investigator’s 4-point 
 assessment scale in a pediatric population. 
 treatments 
 groups 
 rviii-singlechain 
 prophylaxis 
 subjects receiving routine prophylaxis treatment were initially 
 treated with 15-50 iu/kg of rviii-singlechain every 2nd day or 2 
 to 3 times per week, or at the investigator’s discretion, based 
 upon available pk data, the fviii treatment regimen used before 
 enrollment and/or the subject’s bleeding phenotype. the dose or 
 dosing frequency may have been adjusted if necessary. 
 preventative and additional doses of rviii-singlechain were 
 allowed; data from such doses are included in the analysis of 
 &apos;consumption of rviii-singlechain&apos; end points. &quot;preventative 
 dose&quot; was a dose taken before an activity or a minor procedure to 
 prevent or minimize a bleeding episode and &quot;additional dose&quot; was 
 a dose taken beyond the need to control hemostasis.</p><p>
 rviii-singlechain 
 on-demand</p><p>subjects assigned to the on-demand treatment regimen treated 
 themselves, or were treated by a caregiver/guardian, as needed 
 for any bleeding episode and did not receive routine assigned 
 infusions. preventative and additional doses of rviii-singlechain 
 were allowed; data from such doses are included in the analysis of 
 &apos;consumption of rviii-singlechain&apos; end points. &quot;preventative 
 dose&quot; was defined as a dose taken before an activity or a minor 
 procedure to prevent or minimize a bleeding episode, and 
 &quot;additional dose&quot; was defined as a dose taken beyond the need to 
 control hemostasis.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 discussion on clinical efficacy</header></section><section><header>design and conduct of clinical studies</header><p>efficacy of rfviii-singlechain was mainly evaluated in two phase 3 studies: study 1001 in adults and adolescents 
 ≥12 years of age and study 3002 in children &lt;12 years of age, which both are completed. moreover, a currently ongoing extension study (3001) is being conducted, where around 60% of the 
 subjects from the phase 3 studies had been enrolled by the data cut-off date 29 may 2015. 
 overall, conduct of the clinical investigation of rfviii-singlechain follows the ema guideline on the clinical 
 investigation of factor viii products (ema/chmp/bpwp/144533/2009): a sufficient number of previously 
 treated patients with severe haemophilia a out of the relevant age groups were followed for at least 50 
 eds, with also a sufficient number of subjects 
 ≥12 years who were followed for at least 6 months for assessment of rfviii-singlechain efficacy in prophylaxis. very limited information about the efficacy and 
 safety are available from patients &gt; 60 years. the requested number of rfviii-singlechain response 
 assessments during (major) surgical procedures was satisfied. all subjects in the rviii-singlechain 
 studies had a confirmed fviii level of &lt;1% documented in the source data (inclusion criteria) and with 
 that, a confirmed diagnosis of severe haemophilia a. therefore efficacy results in relation to dose 
 consumption are not biased by the baseline level of fviii. 
 endpoints chosen are regarded appropriate for efficacy assessment of rfviii-singlechain treatment and 
 also in line with the current fviii guidance. 
 the assessment of bleeding episodes such as spontaneous or traumatic was always documented in the 
 database. spontaneous annualized bleeding rate has been introduced as an efficacy parameter. such rate 
 might serve as a parameter for efficacy of prophylaxis as it is “countable” and represents an 
 easy-to-understand number. however, lack of definitions for a “bleed”, for “spontaneous” or “traumatic” 
 nature of such bleed and individual evaluation factors are considered to be highly challenging when 
 comparing numbers. furthermore, comparison of abr while on on-demand versus on 
 prophylaxis-regimen is considered to be of highly restricted value: on-demand therapy mainly represents 
 severity of haemophilia (overall bleeding frequency) and not efficacy of a certain product. on the other 
 hand, total abr while on prophylaxis ideally should aim at zero bleeds and should be amended by 
 documentation of exceptional challenges during the evaluation period. 
 rfviii-singlechain efficacy was investigated in treatment and prevention of bleeds, routine prophylaxis 
 and perioperative management by assessment of treatment response rating, rfviii-singlechain 
 consumption and determination of (annualised) bleeding rates. the treatment of bleedings in the 
 on-demand setting is regarded as a different situation e.g. localization, severity and frequency of the 
 bleed. therefore, in this non-randomized study, subjects were able to choose whether to receive 
 on-demand or prophylaxis treatment. it is accepted because randomization of a subject from their 
 current prophylactic regimen to on-demand treatment would be considered unethical. presentation of 
 results of response rating was done for all kinds of bleeding episodes. as requested, the response 
 assessment stratified by severity of the bleeding episodes has been provided by the applicant. median 
 dose per injection (iu/kg/injection) and median total dose (iu/kg/bleed) in minor and moderate bleeds 
 are comparable between groups. however, in major bleeds both median dose per injection (48.9 vs. 
 31.6) and median total dose (50.5 vs. 31.8) were higher in study 3002. this discrepancy seems to 
 attribute to the fact that in children those bleeds stratified into the major category were treated with a</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 81/103</p><p> 
 higher dose. overall treatment success varied from 88.9% (study 3002, major bleeds) to 100% (study 1001, minor bleeds). 
 the statistical methods applied are considered appropriate in general.</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses study1001</header><p>the efficacy population of study 1001 comprised 173 subjects ≥12 to ≤65 years (27 subjects on an on-demand regimen, 146 subjects on a prophylaxis regimen) exposed to rviii-singlechain for 14,306 
 eds and treating 848 bleeding episodes overall.</p><p> 
 demographic and baseline characteristics of study subjects reflect the typical population of patients with 
 haemophilia a. the applicant has chosen to exclude subjects older than 65 years. thus, efficacy data in 
 this subpopulation is missing completely. therefore, the smpc does list data in this subpopulation as 
 missing.. 
 in study 1001, adult and adolescent subjects receiving prophylaxis (n=146) had a median abr of 1.14 
 (q1,q3: 0.0, 4.2) bleeding episodes/year and a median asbr of 0.00 (q1,q3: 0.0, 2.4) bleeding 
 episodes/year. both values were significantly lower than the median abr and asbr in subjects receiving 
 on-demand treatment (n=27); 19.64 (q1,q3: 6.2, 46.5)and 11.73 (q1,q3: 2.8, 36.5) bleeding 
 episodes/year, respectively. based on a poisson model, this represents a reduction in mean abr and 
 asbr by 
 ≥ 90% with prophylaxis compared to on-demand. the majority of spontaneous bleeding episodes that required treatment were located in the joint, followed 
 by the muscle and other locations, which is consistent with the nature of the disease (severe 
 haemophilia). 
 in general, the annualised bleeding rates are regarded to be in an acceptable range. it is recognized that 
 one subject who achieved a prophylactic treatment regimen had 40 spontaneous bleeding episodes per 
 year. the applicant has thoroughly discussed all cases of subjects who achieved a prophylactic treatment 
 regimen with more than 5 bleeding episodes. common contributing factors, significant joint inflammation 
 or a more severe bleeding phenotype explain the observed higher number of bleeds. 
 in study 1001, there were no differences in abr and asbr between the 2-times weekly and 
 3-times-weekly regimens, neither in the initial nor the final dose assignment analysis. the median abr 
 and asbr were both 0.00 in the 46 subjects on a 2-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen with a dose of 20 
 to 50 iu/kg and 1.53 and 0.00 in the 77 subjects on a 3-times-weekly regimen with a dose of 20 to 50 
 iu/kg. 
 in adults/adolescents in study 1001 on a 3-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen, the median starting dose 
 was 30 iu/kg per injection; subjects dosed 2 times weekly had a median starting dose of 35 iu/kg per 
 injection. rviii-singlechain consumption across all regimens was 4,283 iu/kg/year (median) and 4494 
 iu/kg/year (mean). presentation of consumption of fviii follows the clinical guideline. the presented 
 consumption-data support efficacy of rfviii-singlechain, overall. 
 a dose of 20 to 50 iu/kg administered 2 to 3 times weekly is proposed for prophylaxis. the applicant was 
 asked to provide individual patient data listings of injections reflecting dose/kg and date of application for 
 each patient as well as stratification in age groups. the additional data, as presented by the applicant, 
 were regarded sufficient to support the dose recommendations in the adolescent and adult population. 
 as requested the applicant provided the overall prophylaxis consumption as “total dose administered per 
 subject per month (iu/kg)” including preventative doses (prevention prior to activity) as well as doses for</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 82/103</p><p> 
 ‘bleeding event’, ‘surgery’, ‘post surgery’, and ‘additional treatment’. additional details why the preventative dose was administered were not documented; therefore an individual summary of reasons 
 for administration is not available. instead, the applicant presented a compliance calculation. this was 
 accepted.</p><p>
 in subjects 
 ≥12 to ≤65 years in study 1001, treatment success (ie, an investigator haemostatic efficacy rating of 
 “excellent” or “good”) was documented in 92.3% of all treated bleeding episodes assessed in the on-demand and prophylaxis regimens combined. 
 the applicant provided information regarding number of infusions for treatment of a bleeding episode. in 
 study 1001 in adults/adolescents, 80.9% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 injection, 12.6% 
 with 2 injections, and 3.4% with 3 injections of rviii-singlechain which is regarded as a good and 
 sufficient response. in summary, breakthrough bleeding episodes on prophylaxis were controlled with 1 
 or 2 injections of rviii-singlechain in 90.7% of events in adult/adolescent subjects. 
 overall, the success rates of the treatment of bleeds using rviii-singlechain are in an acceptable range. 
 in no patients the haemostatic response was rated as poor. more bleeding episodes per subject were 
 reported in the on-demand regimen than in the prophylaxis regimen, in line with expectations for the 
 treatment modalities. 
 there are 16 surgeries among the 13 subjects in the surgical population. a sufficient number of major 
 surgeries were evaluated for rfviii-singlechain efficacy. the provided data sufficiently show haemostatic 
 effect of rviii-singlechain during surgery and fulfil the requirements of the guideline. however, no 
 pediatric subjects &lt;18 years of age were included in the surgery population. it is considered appropriate 
 to mention this in the smpc.</p></section><section><header>study 3002</header><p>the efficacy of rviii-singlechain in treatment of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis was assessed in 83 subjects &lt; 12 years of age with haemophilia a. 
 it should be noted that only 3 subjects were assigned to an on-demand regimen, and that no formal 
 comparisons of abr between on-demand and prophylaxis regimens were performed. 
 there were a total of 389 bleeding episodes in the 83 subjects in the efficacy population. of these, 347 
 episodes in 62 subjects required treatment with rviii-singlechain. the number of treated bleeding 
 episodes per subject was higher in the on-demand regimen (total of 132 episodes in 3 subjects) than in 
 the prophylaxis regimen (total of 215 episodes in 59 subjects), as expected with the assigned treatment 
 modality. 
 overall, the most frequent location of bleeding episodes was the joint (61.7%), followed by other 
 locations (23.1%), and the muscle (14.4%). 
 subjects in the age group 
 ≥6 to &lt;12 years had more total bleeding episodes (especially a higher proportion of traumatic bleeding episodes). this is considered to a higher level physical activity in the 
 older age group. 
 investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy in 347 bleeds was “excellent” or “good” in the majority 
 (96.3%) of bleeding episodes which is considered be acceptable. one patient is found for response rated 
 as “poor/none response” and further 12 patients are documented with “moderate response”. the 
 applicant was asked to comment. from this further analysis no clinically relevant impact on the final 
 efficacy conclusion from studies 3002 was identified. for 42 bleeds no fviii-substitution was required, at 
 all.</p><p>assessment report</p><p> 
 ema/795172/2016</p><p>
 page 83/103</p><p> 
 treatment success was documented in 96.3% of all treated bleeding episodes in the on-demand and prophylaxis regimens combined. 85.9% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 injection, 9.8% with 
 2 injections, and 2.3% with 3 injections of rviii-singlechain. 
 the median abr was higher with the 2-times-weekly regimen than with the 3-times-weekly regimen 
 (medians of 4.37 (q1,q3: 2.31, 7.24) and 2.30 (q1,q3: 0.00, 2.08), respectively) as well as in the older 
 age group than in the younger age group (medians of 5.11 and 2.12, respectively). the higher abr in the 
 2-times-weekly regimen might reflect the higher cl and shorter t1/2 of rviii-singlechain in children, but 
 could also be the result of an almost 30% lower weekly consumption in subjects assigned to a 
 2-times-weekly regimen. the higher abr in the older age group might reflect a more active population. 
 these findings suggest that higher rviii-singlechain doses might be considered for children on a 
 2-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen, and more frequent injections might be required in active children. 
 the median observed asbr for spontaneous bleeding episodes was 0.00 (q1,q3: 0.00, 3.03) for the 
 3-times-weekly regimen and 0.00 (q1,q3: 0.00, 2.08) for the 2-times-weekly regimens. 
 according to pk simulations in the group &lt; 6 years old receiving a dose regimen 30 iu/kg twice weekly 
 (either day 0 and 3.5 or day 0 and 4) only 54.7% and 46.2% remained at a trough level &gt; 1% whereas 
 in the group &gt;12 years old 73.7% and 64.2 % remained. if only these pk simulations are taken into 
 account, this percentage is considered to be too low to support the twice weekly 30 iu/kg regimen in the 
 paediatric population. 
 it was requested that the applicant provide the abr and asbr for subjects on 2- and 3-times- weekly 
 regimens stratified by age group and stratified in dose range. in the age groups 0 to &lt; 6 years and 6 to 
 &lt;12 years the abr and asbr was higher in the &lt;30 iu/kg range. therefore, the applicant recommends 
 a starting dose for children &lt; 12 years of age on prophylaxis of 30 to 50 iu/kg 2 or 3 times weekly taking 
 also into account the presented pk simulations. in principle this dose modification was endorsed, but the 
 dose regimen 30 iu/kg 2 times weekly was still considered questionable especially in the younger children 
 population. however, after further detailed analysis of stratified data, it is agreed that in children dosage 
 regimens above 30 iu/kg are sufficient to achieve abr and asbrs comparable with other recombinant 
 fviii products. thus, the smpc recommendation of starting dose for children of 30 to 50 iu/kg 2 or 3 time 
 weekly is considered acceptable. 
 across all prophylaxis regimens, the median prophylaxis dose per subject was 342 iu/kg per month and 
 4109 iu/kg per year. the overall annual consumption across all regimens was very similar to the values 
 in study 1001 (rviii-singlechain consumption: 4,283 iu/kg/year [median] and 4,494 iu/kg/year 
 [mean]). 
 the respective values in adults and children are reflected in the smpc, as reference for efficacy in 
 prophylaxis.</p></section><section><header n="2.7.2">2.7.2.

 pre-existing inhibitor. a low-titre inhibitor was detected at 4 weeks on afstyla; retrospectively, the 
 negative screening test (central lab) was repeated and found to be positive. furthermore, this subject had 
 positive adas (igg), initially, experienced a teae of hypersensitivity at his second treatment day which 
 required treatment with antihistamines, and the subject experienced a tesae of bacteraemia with chills

 of 14 subjects, who turned positive after being negative for adas at baseline, the applicant is asked to provide information on possible associated clinical symptoms (studies 1001 and 3002) and laboratory 
 findings (especially relation of ada positivity to lowering of rbc). no positive relationship was found. 
 the applicant was asked for the ada-status of subjects with normocytic anaemia. however, adas were 
 negative. 
 none of the subjects who tested positive for non-inhibitory adas experienced teaes that, upon medical 
 review, were assessed to be associated with any of the reported non-inhibitory adas. 
 no subject in any of the rviii-singlechain clinical studies entered with anti-cho host cell protein 
 antibodies or developed these during the studies. 
 hypersensitivity reactions 
 in study 1001, the predefined search strategy with standardized meddra queries (smqs) identified 15 
 subjects (8.5%) who experienced events that could be considered as symptoms or manifestations of 
 hypersensitivity. 2 subjects (1.1%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions. upon medical review by the 
 sponsor, events of cough and sneezing were not considered to be associated with hypersensitivity 
 reactions. none of the events identified were considered to be anaphylactic reactions.</p><p>
 6 teaes indicative of hypersensitivity were considered to be related to the study drug in 4 of the subjects. 
 in study 3002, the predefined search strategy with smqs identified 13 subjects (15.5%) who experienced 
 19 events that could be considered as symptoms or manifestations of hypersensitivity. all but 1 of these 
 events (hypersensitivity) were considered as unrelated by the investigator. the related event of 
 hypersensitivity was mild in intensity and the dose of rviii-singlechain was not changed as a result of this 
 event. respective subject has been described, above, as case-report of pre-existing inhibitor, 
 ada-positivity, catheter-related sepsis and hypersensitivity. 
 in the interim data up to 29 may 2015 for study 3001, the predefined search strategy with smqs 
 identified 4 subjects (all in the 
 ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 year age group) who experienced aes that were reported as hypersensitivity (eczema, rash pruritic, rash, and drug hypersensitivity). all but 1 of these events (drug 
 hypersensitivity, see below) were considered as unrelated by the investigator and adjudicators. 
 this subject with hypersensitivity: received 153 eds in study 1001 and further 65 eds in study 3001. he 
 experienced a non-serious event of drug hypersensitivity. the event resolved after 1 day. 12 days later, 
 the subject experienced positive re-challenge without the use of premedication and was withdrawn from

 thromboembolic events there were no intravascular tees in any of the 3 clinical studies. in study 3002, 1 subject experienced a 
 tesae of device occlusion that was identified by the smq search “embolic and thrombotic events”. 
 furthermore, risk for tees in the elderly population remains open, as no subject beyond 64 years of age 
 has been followed in clinical studies, yet. 
 local tolerability 
 local tolerability at the injection site was assessed by study subjects on a 5-point scale, and by the 
 investigator using a 5-point scale for erythema and a separate 5-point scale for itching, local pain, or local 
 heat, and by measuring the size of any edema or induration. 
 in study 1001, 99.3% of the 13,580 injections assessed by the subjects had no reactions. in study 3002, 
 99.4% of the 4,774 injections assessed by the subjects had no reactions. in study 3001, 99.9% of the 
 8,587 injections assessed have been reported by the subjects with no reactions. no severe local reactions 
 were reported in any study. 
 overdose 
 any teae associated with 
 ≥ 2 times the prescribed rviii-singlechain dose was considered as an overdose and was to be documented in the electronic case report form and reported to the sponsor within 72 h. 
 one subject from study 1001 reported a teae that was associated with 
 ≥ 2 times the prescribed rviii-singlechain dose. the subject was prescribed between 35-50 iu/kg rviiisinglechain for a bleeding 
 episode, but was administered 6 vials of afstyla, which was 111.3 iu/kg. the subject complained of 
 dizziness and feeling hot and itchy after taking the study drug and tramal. the investigator rated these 
 events as not related to study drug but to the co-administered analgesic. these events were summarized 
 and coded to the pt “adverse drug reaction”, which was mild and not serious.

 exposure and safety were assessed in all subjects who received a dose of rviii-singlechain as part of either a pk evaluation, on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis, or perioperative 
 management of bleeding episodes. safety was assessed based on adverse event (ae) reporting, routine 
 laboratory safety, local tolerability, vital signs, and physical examinations. important identified and 
 potential risks that are class effects for rfviii and pdfviii concentrates include hypersensitivity / 
 anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors against fviii, development of non-inhibitory adas and 
 antibodies against cho host cell proteins. 
 according to the guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant factor viii and ix products, an overall 
 number of 100 individuals is requested for pre-authorisation evaluation of general safety-aspects. at least 
 50 subjects ≥ 12 years of age should be followed for at least 50 exposure days (ed) and at least 50 
 children &lt;12 years and separated into two age-cohorts of 25 subjects, each, should have reached 50 ed, 
 too. such requirements have been met by the presented numbers. 
 furthermore, 14 adolescents ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age were included into study 1001; 8 of 14 reached 
 &gt; 50 eds and 2/14 &gt;100 eds. there is no requirement of specific numbers for adolescents in the clinical 
 guideline. 
 standard laboratory findings and vital-signs- and physical-findings-documentation was within expected 
 range. 
 numbers of adverse events and ae-profile according to socs are in line with similar factor concentrates. 
 26 tesaes in 21 subjects were documented. hypersensitivity was the most relevant symptom to be 
 recognized in relation to afstyla. one patient with pre-existing inhibitor experienced hypersensitivity, and 
 venous-device complication. 
 adverse events of special interest were documented and presented: one low-titre inhibitor 
 retrospectively turned out to be pre-existent. number of non-inhibitory adas did not raise concerns, 
 although the numbers in children are higher than in adults. 
 the guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant fviii and ix products does not request inclusion of 
 elderly subjects. of note, the clinical safety database of rviii-singlechain is limited regarding elderly 
 patients. although no subject experienced tee, the constantly growing elderly population is at higher risk 
 for thromboembolism. experience in geriatric patients (65 years and above) has been included as missing 
 information in the rmp (please see rmp section). 
 paediatric subjects have been included into study 1001 (adolescents, 12-&lt;18 years of age), study 3002 
 (&lt; 12 years of age) and into study 3001 (0-&lt;18years of age).</p><p>
 in addition, factor viii monitoring errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus 
 chromogenic-test-results might not have been identified under clinical trials conditions although 
 potentially a top-up dose might be given, which, while unnecessary, would not result in an additional risk 
 for the affected patient. in healthy individuals, fviii circulates in plasma at concentrations of 50 to 150 
 iu/dl. however, fviii is an acute-phase reactant, and plasma levels in healthy individuals without 
 congenital bleeding disorders rise above 240% in acute situations such as surgery, sports, and infections. 
 while chronically elevated fviii levels have been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis in patients 
 without congenital bleeding disorders that is not the case for acutely elevated fviii plasma activity. given 
 the short plasma half-life of fviii in haemophilia patients, high doses (even in a prophylaxis regimen) 
 would never reach steady state (ie, chronically elevated levels). adverse reactions due to dosing errors 
 caused by misinterpretation of monitoring results are not biologically plausible and therefore are not 
 anticipated. to avoid dosing errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus chromogenic-test-results, a 
 factor 2 for conversion of test results has been introduced.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 leaflets with regard to the key elements and identification of only minor differences between parent 
 (biostate) and daughter (afstyla) leaflet. all key safety messages of the daughter pl are also present in 
 the parent leaflet and the additional text is written in similar patient friendly language. the changes in 
 wording of the daughter leaflets were considered to improve readability and the minor differences in the

 haemophilia a is a rare and serious, x-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males and is characterized by a deficiency of fviii. in patients with haemophilia a, the primary 
 platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because 
 inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, 
 non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. rarely, 
 life-threatening bleeding may also occur. patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
 extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient fviii that is used to classify the disease severity (wfh, 
 2012): 
 • &lt;1% fviii activity: severe haemophilia a • 1% to 5% fviii activity: moderate haemophilia a • 5% to 40% fviii activity: mild haemophilia a patients with severe haemophilia a bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
 permanent, disabling joint damage. 
 afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a 
 (congenital factor viii deficiency). afstyla can be used for all age groups.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.2">3.1.2.  
 available therapies and unmet medical need</header><p>most patients with severe haemophilia require treatment of bleeding episodes and may require regular supplementation with intravenous (iv) factor replacement, either plasma-derived concentrate or 
 recombinant. the goal of haemophilia therapy is to treat or prevent haemorrhage, thereby reducing 
 disabling joint and tissue damage, and improving morbidity and the patient’s quality of life. replacement 
 therapy with fviii in haemophilia a provides a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and the 
 bleeding tendencies. the prophylactic treatment course is variable and individually determined.</p></section><section><header n="3.1.3">3.1.3.

 clinical efficacy of rfviii-singlechain has been investigated in two phase 3 studies in adults and 
 adolescents 
 ≥ 12 years of age and in children &lt;12 years of age in a step-wise approach. rfviii-singlechain efficacy was investigated in treatment of bleeds, routine prophylaxis and perioperative 
 management by assessment of treatment response rating, rfviii-singlechain consumption for a dose of 
 20-50 iu/kg administered 2 to 3 times weekly and determination of abr. pk data serve as an important 
 surrogate endpoint. 
 in the treatment of bleeds, response was assessed as “excellent” or “good” for more than 90% of 
 rfviii-singlechain injections in both phase 3 studies. more than 80% of the occurred bleeds were treated 
 with one injection with a median dose of ~30 iu/kg in subjects 
 ≥12 years and ~35 iu/kg in subjects &lt;12 years of age. median abrs during prophylaxis are 1.14 in subjects 
 ≥12 years and 3.69 bleeds/year in subjects &lt;12 years of age. 
 a sufficient number of major surgeries were evaluated with haemostasis assessed as “excellent” or 
 “good” in all of them.</p><p>assessment report</p><p>

 efficacy has been demonstrated by low abr and fviii-consumption comparable to marketed fviii products and high-level of haemostatic efficacy in bleeding episodes and surgical setting.</p></section><section><header n="3.3">3.3.  
 uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</header><p>no important uncertainties about the key favourable effects have been identified.</p></section><section><header n="3.4">3.4.  
 unfavourable effects</header><p>the risk-profile of afstyla might be described by well-known risks from other factor viii concentrates together with anticipated risks according to specifically introduced changes of the molecule when 
 compared with the native fviii. ae-documentation from submitted clinical studies 1001 (pivotal pk and 
 efficacy-study), 3002 (paediatric study) and preliminary results from the ongoing extension study 3001 
 serves as the main source of information. well-known risks include inhibitor development, 
 hypersensitivity reactions, thrombo-embolic events, development of adas and anti-cho antibodies. 
 for afstyla, no de-novo inhibitor has been documented, so far. hypersensitivity-reactions have been 
 identified in nine subjects (rated as related in 6 subjects), of which one needed treatment with steroids 
 and antihistamines for a limited period of time.</p><p>there was one other patient with pre-existing inhibitor 
 and positive adas who also experienced hypersensitivity. 
 non-inhibitory adas were detected during the treatment among patients negative at baseline. no clinical 
 relevance has been identified, yet.</p></section><section><header n="3.5">3.5.  
 uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</header><p>a high discrepancy was noted between results obtained with the os and the chs assay: the one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the factor viii activity level compared to the chromogenic assay 
 result by approximately 45%.. the linear relationship across critical fviii activity levels demonstrated a 
 consistent proportional decrease in os fviii activity measurements. thus, the applicant proposes to 
 include a conversion factor of 2 into the smpc posology recommendations which should align os activity 
 levels with chs activity results.</p><p>
 factor viii monitoring errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus chromogenic-test-results might not 
 have been identified under clinical trials conditions although potentially causing a top-up dose to be given, 
 which, while unnecessary, would not result in an additional risk for the affected patient. in healthy 
 individuals, fviii circulates in plasma at concentrations of 50 to 150 iu/dl. however, fviii is an 
 acute-phase reactant, and plasma levels in healthy individuals without congenital bleeding disorders rise 
 above 240% in acute situations such as surgery, sports, and infections. while chronically elevated fviii 
 levels have been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis in patients without congenital bleeding 
 disorders, that is not the case for acutely elevated fviii plasma activity. given the short plasma half-life 
 of fviii in haemophilia patients, high doses (even in a prophylaxis regimen) would never reach steady 
 state (ie, chronically elevated levels). adverse reactions due to dosing errors caused by misinterpretation 
 of monitoring results are not biologically plausible and therefore are not anticipated . this has been 
 included an important potential risk. 
 studies enrolled elderly patients only to a very low extent (two patients so far 
 ≥60 years).</p><p>hence, the chmp considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety (please

 - in order to obtain further safety data (on the important identified and potential risks described in the rmp) in prophylaxis, on-demand long-term treatment and in surgery, the company should submit the 
 results of study 3001, a phase iii open label, multicenter, extension study to assess the safety and 
 efficacy of recombinant coagulation factor viii (rviii-singlechain, csl627) in subjects with severe 
 haemophilia a. 
 - in order to investigate the hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors to factor 
 viii and potential dosing errors, the company should participate in euhass to collect long-term safety 
 data.</p></section><section><header n="3.6">3.6.
