 the potency (iu) is determined using the european pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. the 
 specific activity of afstyla is 7400 - 16000 iu/mg protein.
 afstyla is a single-chain recombinant human factor viii produced in chinese hamster ovary 
 (cho) cells. it is a construct where most of the b-domain occurring in wild-type, full-length 
 factor viii and 4 amino acids of the adjacent acidic a3 domain were removed (amino acids 765 to 
 1652 of full-length factor viii).
 the newly formed linkage of the heavy and light chain of factor viii introduces a new n-
 glycosylation site. as the furin cleavage site present in wild type factor viii between the b-
 domain and the a3 domain was removed, afstyla is expressed as a single-chain factor viii 
 molecule.

 during the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor viii levels is advised to guide 
 the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. individual patients may vary 
 in their responses to factor viii, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. dose based on 
 4bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. in the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of 
 coagulation analysis (plasma factor viii activity) is indispensable.
 when using an 
 in vitro thromboplastin time (aptt)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor viii activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor viii activity results can 
 be significantly affected by both the type of aptt reagent and the reference standard used in the 
 assay. also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aptt-based 
 one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to ph. eur. this is of importance 
 particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.
 plasma factor viii activity in patients receiving afstyla using either the chromogenic assay or 
 the one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency 
 of repeat injections. the chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic 
 potential of afstyla and is preferred. the one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the 
 factor viii activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. if the 
 one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the 
 patient’s factor viii activity level.
 posology
 the dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor viii 
 deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient&apos;s clinical condition. 
 the number of units of factor viii administered is expressed in international units (iu), which 
 are related to the current who concentrate standard for factor viii products. factor viii activity 
 in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
 international units (relative to an international standard for factor viii in plasma).
 one international unit (iu) of factor viii activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor viii in 
 one ml of normal human plasma.
 potency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay.
 plasma factor viii levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-
 stage clotting assay.
 on demand treatmentthe calculation of the required dose of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international unit (iu) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 2 
 iu/dl. the required dose is determined using the following formula:
 dose (iu) = body weight (kg) x desired factor viii rise (iu/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (iu/kg per 
 iu/dl)
 the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to 
 the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
 in the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor viii activity should not fall below the 
 given plasma activity level (in % of normal or iu/dl) within the corresponding period. the following 
 table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:</p></section><section><header>degree of haemorrhage / type of surgical

 prophylaxis the recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 iu/kg of afstyla administered 2 to 3 times weekly. the regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.
 paediatric population the recommended starting regimen in children (0 to &lt;12 years of age) is 30 to 50 iu per kg of afstyla administered 2 to 3 times weekly. more frequent or higher doses may be required in 
 children &lt;12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. 
 for adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for 
 adults (please refer to section 5.2).

 hypersensitivity
 allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with afstyla. the product contains traces of 
 hamster proteins. if symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use 
 of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. patients should be informed of the 
 early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, 
 wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
 6for patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions appropriate pre-medication may be considered.in case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
 inhibitors
 the formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor viii is a known complication in the 
 management of individuals with haemophilia a. these inhibitors are usually igg immunoglobulins 
 directed against the factor viii procoagulant activity, which are quantified in bethesda units (bu) per 
 ml of plasma using the modified assay. the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
 the disease as well as the exposure to factor viii, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure 
 days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
 the clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
 posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
 in general, all patients treated with coagulation factor viii products should be carefully monitored 
 for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. if the 
 expected factor viii activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an 
 appropriate dose, testing for factor viii inhibitor presence should be performed. in patients with 
 high levels of inhibitor, factor viii therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options 
 should be considered. management of such patients should be directed by physicians with 
 experience in the care of haemophilia and factor viii inhibitors.
 monitoring laboratory tests
 if the one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine 
 the patient’s factor viii activity level (see section 4.2).
 cardiovascular events
 in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor viii may increase 
 the cardiovascular risk.
 catheter-related complications
 if a central venous access device (cvad) is required, risk of cvad-related complications 
 including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
 sodium content
 this medicine contains up to 7 mg (0.3 mmol) sodium per ml after reconstitution. to be taken

 5.1
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor viii. atc code: b02bd02
 mechanism of action 
 afstyla (inn: lonoctocog alfa) is a recombinant human protein that replaces the missing 
 coagulation factor viii needed for effective hemostasis. afstyla is a single polypeptide chain 
 with a truncated b-domain that allows for a covalent bridge to link the factor viii heavy and light 
 chains. afstyla has demonstrated a higher vwf affinity relative to full-length rfviii. vwf 
 stabilizes factor viii and protects it from degradation. activated afstyla has an amino acid 
 sequence identical to endogenous fviiia.
 pharmacodynamic effects
 the factor viii/von willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor viii and von 
 willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. when infused into a haemophiliac 
 patient, factor viii binds to von willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. activated factor 
 viii acts as a cofactor for activated factor ix, accelerating the conversion of factor x to activated 
 factor x. activated factor x converts prothrombin into thrombin. thrombin then converts 
 fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
 haemophilia a is an x-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
 factor viii and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
 spontaneously or as result of accidental or surgical trauma. by replacement therapy the plasma 
 levels of factor viii are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
 deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
 clinical efficacy and safety
 adult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of agestudy 1001 determined the efficacy and safety in the prevention of bleeding events in prophylaxis, hemostatic efficacy in the control of bleeding events and during perioperative management. the study 
 enrolled 175 previously treated patients (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia a (1 subject 
 &gt;60 years of age was enrolled) who accumulated a total of 14,306 eds with rviii-singlechain. no 
 patient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction. 
 prophylaxis: 146 subjects were assigned to a prophylaxis regimen (median abr, 1.14 (interquartile range: 0.0, 4.2)), 79 (54%) were assigned a 3-times per week regimen and 47 (32%) a 2-times per 
 week regimen. patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and 
 30 iu/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens of 4,283 iu/kg year.
 treatment of bleeding: of the 848 bleeding events observed during study 1001, 93.5% were controlled with 2 or fewer injections. the median dose to treat a bleeding episode was 34.7 iu/kg.
 perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): a total of 16 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 13 subjects in study 1001. hemostatic efficacy of rviii-singlechain in 
 surgical prophylaxis was rated as excellent or good in all surgeries. no paediatric subjects &lt;18 years 
 of age were included in the surgery population.
 9paediatric population &lt;12 years of agestudy 3002 enrolled a total of 84 previously treated patients &lt;12 years of age (35 &lt;6 years of age and 49 6 to &lt;12 years of age). the study participants accumulated a total of 5,239 eds with rviii-
 singlechain. no patient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction.
 individualised prophylaxis: of the 81 patients on prophylaxis (median abr 3.69 (interquartile range: 0.00, 7.20)), 43 (53%) were assigned to a 2-times weekly regimen and 25 (31%) to a 3-times per week 
 regimen. patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and 32
 iu/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens of 
 4,109 iu/kg year.
 treatment of bleeding: of the 347 bleeding events observed during study 3002, 95.7%were controlled with 2 or fewer injections. the median dose used to treat a bleeding event was 27.6 iu/kg 
 of note, annualized bleeding rate (abr) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
 between different clinical studies.

 the solution should be almost colourless, clear or slightly opalescent. after 
 filtering/withdrawal (see below) the reconstituted product should be inspected visually for 
 particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
 -
 do not use visibly cloudy solutions or solutions still containing flakes or particles. 
 -
 reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions.
 reconstitution and administration
 bring the solvent to room temperature. ensure powder and solvent vial flip caps are removed and 
 the stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the 
 mix2vial package.
 1
 1. open the mix2vial by peeling off the lid. do</p></section><section><header>not</header><p> remove the mix2vial from the blister package!
 1322. place the</p></section><section><header>solvent vial</header><p> on an even, clean surface and hold the vial tight. take the mix2vial together with the blister 
 package and push the spike of the</p></section><section><header>blue</header><p> adapter end</p></section><section><header>straight down</header><p> through the solvent vial stopper.3
 3. carefully remove the blister package from the mix2vial 
 set by holding at the rim, and pulling</p></section><section><header>vertically</header><p> upwards.make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
 not the mix2vial set.
 4
 4. place the</p></section><section><header>powder vial</header><p> on an even and firm surface. invert the solvent vial with the mix2vial set attached and push 
 the spike of the</p></section><section><header>transparent</header><p> adapter end</p></section><section><header>straight down</header><p>through the powder vial stopper. the solvent will automatically flow into the powder vial.
 5
 5. with one hand grasp the product-side of the mix2vial set 
 and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and 
 unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two 
 pieces.
 discard the solvent vial with the blue mix2vial adapter 
 attached.
 6
 6. gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
 attached until the substance is fully dissolved. do not 
 shake.
 7
 7. draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. while the product 
 vial is upright, connect the syringe to the mix2vial&apos;s luer 
 lock fitting by screwing clockwise. inject air into the 
 product vial.
 withdrawal and administration
 1488. while keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
 system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
 by pulling the plunger back slowly.
 99. now that the solution has been transferred into the 
 syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
 (keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
 the transparent mix2vial adapter from the syringe by 
 unscrewing counterclockwise.
 for injection of afstyla the provided administration sets are recommended to be used because 
 treatment failure can occur as a consequence of factor viii adsorption to the internal surface of 
 some injection equipment.
 care should be taken that no blood enters the syringe filled with product, as there is a risk that the 
 blood could coagulate in the syringe and fibrin clots could therefore be administered to the 
 patient. 
 the afstyla solution must not be diluted.
 the reconstituted solution should be administered by a separate injection/infusion line by slow 
 intravenous injection, at a rate comfortable to the patient, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.
 any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
 requirements.</p></section><section><header>7.marketing authorisation holder</header><p>csl behring gmbhemil-von-behring-str. 76

 contents of the pack and other information</p></section><section><header>1.what afstyla is and what it is used for</header><p>afstyla is a human clotting (coagulation) factor viii product that is produced by recombinant dna technology. the active substance in afstyla is lonoctocog alfa.
 afstyla is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia a (inborn factor 
 viii deficiency). factor viii is involved in blood clotting. lack of this factor means that blood does 
 not clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. afstyla works by 
 replacing the missing factor viii in haemophilia a patients to enable their blood to clot normally.
 afstyla can be used for all age groups.</p></section><section><header>2.what you need to know before you use afstyla

 the formation of</p></section><section><header>inhibitors</header><p> (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all factor viii medicines. these inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
 treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the 
 development of these inhibitors. if you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with 
 afstyla, tell your doctor immediately.
 if you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell your doctor or pharmacist.
 if you need a central venous access device (cvad for injection of afstyla), the risk of complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of 
 a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted should be considered 
 by your doctor.</p></section><section><header>other medicines and afstyla</header><p>tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding</header><p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

 afstyla must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in section 6.
 the solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e., it might be sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. after filtering or 
 withdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. do not use the 
 solution if it is visibly cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.
 any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements and as instructed by your doctor. 
 reconstitution and administration
 without opening the vials, warm the afstyla powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. 
 this can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them 
 in your hands for a few minutes. 
 do not expose the vials to direct heat. the vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 °c).
 carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
 alcohol swab. allow the vials to dry before opening the mix2vial package (which contains the filter 
 transfer device), then follow the instructions given below.
 1
 1. open the mix2vial by peeling off the lid. do</p></section><section><header>not</header><p> remove the mix2vial from the blister package!

 and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and 
 unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two 
 pieces.
 discard the solvent vial with the blue mix2vial adapter 
 attached.
 66. gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
 attached until the substance is fully dissolved. do not 
 shake.
 77. draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. while the product 
 vial is upright, connect the syringe to the mix2vial&apos;s luer 
 lock fitting by screwing clockwise. inject air into the 
 product vial.
 withdrawal and administration
 88. while keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
 system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
 by pulling the plunger back slowly.
 99. now that the solution has been transferred into the 
 syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
 (keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
 the transparent mix2vial adapter from the syringe by 
 unscrewing counterclockwise.
 use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. let blood flow back 
 to the end of the tube. attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit.</p></section><section><header>injectthe reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min) into 
 the vein</header><p>following the instructions given to you by your doctor. take care not to get any blood in the syringe containing the product.
 check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. if you have any side effects that 
 might be related to the administration of afstyla, the injection should be stopped (see also section 
 2).

 53----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></section><section><header>the following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</header><p>treatment monitoringduring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor viii levels is advised to guide 
 the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. individual patients may vary 
 in their responses to factor viii, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. dose based on 
 bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. in the case of major 
 surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of 
 coagulation analysis (plasma factor viii activity) is indispensable.
 when using an 
 in vitro thromboplastin time (aptt)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor viii activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor viii activity results can 
 be significantly affected by both the type of aptt reagent and the reference standard used in the 
 assay. also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aptt-based 
 one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to ph. eur. this is of importance 
 particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.
 plasma factor viii activity in patients receiving afstyla using either the chromogenic assay or 
 the one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency 
 of repeat injections. the chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic 
 potential of afstyla and is preferred. the one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the 
 factor viii activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. if the 
 one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the 
 patient’s factor viii activity level. 
 posology
 the dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor viii 
 deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient&apos;s clinical condition. 
 the number of units of factor viii administered is expressed in international units (iu), which 
 are related to the current who concentrate standard for factor viii products. factor viii activity 
 in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in preferably 
 international units (relative to an international standard for factor viii in plasma).
 one international unit (iu) of factor viii activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor viii in 
 one ml of normal human plasma.
 potency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay.
 plasma factor viii levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-stage 
 clotting assay.
 on demand treatmentthe calculation of the required dose of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international unit (iu) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 2 
 iu/dl. the required dose is determined using the following formula:
 dose (iu) = body weight (kg) x desired factor viii rise (iu/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (iu/kg per 
 iu/dl)
 the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to 
 the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
 54in the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor viii activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or iu/dl) within the corresponding period. the following 
 table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:</p></section><section><header>degree of haemorrhage / type of surgical

 prophylaxisthe recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 iu/kg of afstyla administered 2 to 3 times weekly. the regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.
 paediatric populationthe recommended starting regimen in children (0 to &lt;12 years of age) is 30 to 50 iu per kg of afstyla administered 2 to 3 times weekly. more frequent or higher doses may be required in 
 children &lt;12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. 
 for adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for 
 adults.
 elderlyclinical studies of afstyla did not include subjects over 65 years of age.</p></section></body></xml>
