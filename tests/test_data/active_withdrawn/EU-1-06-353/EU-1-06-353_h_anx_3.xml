 posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><p>
 thelin is to be taken orally as a dose of 100 mg once daily. it may be taken with or without food and 
 without regard to the time of day.</p><p>
 in the case of clinical deterioration despite thelin treatment for at least 12 weeks, alternative therapies 
 should be considered. however, a number of patients who showed no response by week 12 of 
 treatment with thelin responded favourably by week 24, so an additional 12 weeks of treatment may 
 be considered.</p><p>
 higher doses did not confer additional benefit sufficient to offset the increased risk of adverse 
 reactions, particularly liver injury (see section 4.4).</p><p>
 discontinuation of treatment 
 there is limited experience with abrupt discontinuation of sitaxentan sodium. no evidence for acute 
 rebound has been observed.</p><p>
 dosage in hepatic impairment: 
 studies in patients with pre-existing liver impairment have not been conducted. thelin is 
 contraindicated in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases prior to initiation of treatment (&gt; 3 x 
 upper limit of normal (uln)) (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 dosage in renal impairment: 
 no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>3use in children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years). thelin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on 
 safety and efficacy.</p><p>
 elderly patients: 
 no dosage adjustment is needed in patients over the age of 65 years.</p><p>
 use in patients using other medicines: 
 the efficacy and safety of thelin co-administration with other treatments for pulmonary arterial 
 hypertension (e.g. epoprostenol, sildenafil, iloprost) has not been studied in controlled clinical trials. 
 therefore, caution is recommended in case of co-administration.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</p><p>

 lactation (see section 4.6)</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>no data are available with thelin in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. however, cases of life threatening pulmonary oedema have been reported with 
 vasodilators (mainly prostacyclin) when used in those patients. consequently, should signs of 
 pulmonary oedema occur when thelin is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the 
 possibility of associated veno-occlusive disease should be considered.</p><p>
 the efficacy of thelin as monotherapy has not been established in patients with nyha/who 
 functional class iv pulmonary arterial hypertension. transfer to a therapy that is recommended at the 
 severe stage of the disease (e.g. epoprostenol) should be considered if the clinical condition 
 deteriorates (see section 4.2).</p><p>
 liver function: 
 liver function abnormalities have been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. endothelin 
 receptor antagonists, as a class, have been associated with liver function abnormalities.</p><p>
 elevations of ast and/or alt associated with thelin occur both early and late in treatment, usually 
 progress slowly, and are typically asymptomatic. during clinical trials, these changes were usually 
 reversible when monitoring and discontinuation guidelines were followed. liver aminotransferase 
 elevations may reverse spontaneously while continuing treatment with sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 because treatment-associated elevations of ast and/or alt are a marker for potential serious liver 
 injury, liver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and subsequently 
 at monthly intervals.</p><p>if ast and/or alt are above 3 x uln prior to initiation of therapy, use of 
 thelin is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 recommendations in case of treatment-emergent alt/ast elevations:</p><p>
 if alt/ast measurements rise to the following levels then changes to the monitoring or treatment are 
 given</p><p>4&gt; 3 and ≤5 × uln confirm by another liver test within 2 weeks. if confirmed, continue to monitor 
 aminotransferases at least every 2 weeks.</p><p>if the aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values, 
 return to monthly liver testing.</p><p> &gt; 5 × uln</p><p> if aminotransferase levels increase to above 5 x uln, stop treatment and monitor 
 aminotransferase levels at least every 2 weeks until levels have normalised.</p><p>if the aminotransferase 
 levels return to pre-treatment values, consider reintroducing thelin according to the conditions 
 described below.</p><p>
 if liver transferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, 
 vomiting, anorexia, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in 
 total bilirubin above 2 x uln, treatment should be stopped and re-introduction of thelin is not to be 
 considered.</p><p>re-introduction of treatment: 
 re-introduction of treatment with thelin should only be considered if the potential benefits of 
 treatment with thelin outweigh the potential risks and when liver aminotransferase levels are within 
 pre-treatment values. the advice of a hepatologist is recommended. re-introduction must follow the 
 guidelines detailed in section 4.2. aminotransferase levels must then be checked within 3 days after 
 re-introduction, then again after a further 2 weeks, and thereafter according to the recommendations 
 above.</p><p>
 pre-existing liver impairment 
 studies in patients with pre-existing liver impairment have not been conducted. thelin is 
 contraindicated in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases prior to initiation of treatment (&gt; 3 x 
 uln, see section 4.3)</p><p>
 haemoglobin concentration 
 treatment with 
 thelin 
 was associated with a dose-related decrease in haemoglobin (see section 4.8). 
 most of this decrease of haemoglobin concentration was detected during the first few weeks of 
 treatment and haemoglobin levels stabilized by 4 weeks of 
 thelin 
 treatment. 
 it is recommended that 
 haemoglobin concentrations be checked prior to treatment</p></section><section><header>,</header><p>after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. if a marked decrease in haemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be 
 undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment.</p><p>
 bleeding 
 there is an increased risk of bleeding with thelin, mainly in the form of epistaxis and gingival 
 bleeding</p><p>
 vitamin k antagonists 
 thelin increases the plasma levels of vitamin k antagonists such as warfarin, acenocoumarol and 
 fenprocoumon (see section 4.5).</p><p>
 drugs which inhibit oatp 
 the extent of interaction with potent oatp inhibitors (e.g. some statins, proteinase inhibitors, 
 tuberculostatics) is unknown. as this could result in raised plasma levels of sitaxentan sodium, 
 patients in need of the combination should be closely monitored for adverse events related to 
 sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 oral contraceptive agents 
 thelin use results in increased oestrogen exposure when given concomitantly with oral contraceptive 
 agents (see section 4.5). therefore, especially in women who smoke, there is an increased risk for 
 thromboembolism.</p><p>given a theoretical higher risk for thromboembolism, traditional concomitant use 
 of vitamin k antagonists is of special importance.</p><p>5pregnancy due to possible teratogenicity, the treatment must not be initiated in women of child-bearing potential 
 unless they practice reliable contraception. if necessary, pregnancy testing should be undertaken (see 
 section 4.6).</p><p>
 excipients 
 thelin tablets</p><p>contain lactose monohydrate. patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
 intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
 medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>in vitro data indicate that sitaxentan sodium is an inhibitor of cyp2c9 and, to a lesser extent, of cyp2c19, cyp3a4/5 and cyp 2c8. plasma concentrations of drugs principally metabolized by these 
 isoenzymes, particularly cyp2c9 may be increased during sitaxentan sodium co-administration. co-
 administration with drugs metabolized by cyp2c19 or cyp3a4/5 is not expected to result in 
 clinically significant drug interactions. based on a similar study with digoxin, thelin does not affect 
 the p-glycoprotein transporter.</p><p>
 sitaxentan sodium is metabolized by cyp2c9 and cyp3a4/5. administration of thelin with 
 cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 inhibitors is not expected to result in clinically significant drug interactions. 
 based on a study with ciclosporin it was postulated that sitaxentan sodium is a substrate of oatp 
 transporter proteins.</p><p>
 effects of thelin on other medicinal products</p><p>
 warfarin (vitamin k antagonist, substrate of cyp2c9): concomitant treatment with thelin resulted in 
 a 2.4 fold increase in s-warfarin exposure. subjects receiving warfarin achieve therapeutic 
 anticoagulation (international normalised ratio (inr) target) with lower doses of the anticoagulant in 
 the presence of sitaxentan sodium. it is expected that a similar increase in anticoagulant effect will be 
 seen with warfarin analogues, including acenocoumarol, fenprocoumon and fluindione. when 
 initiating vitamin k antagonist therapy in a patient taking sitaxentan sodium, it is recommended to 
 start at the lowest available dose of the vitamin k antagonist. in patients already taking such 
 medication, it is recommended that the vitamin k antagonist be reduced when starting sitaxentan 
 sodium. in all cases, inr should be monitored on a regular schedule. increases in the vitamin k 
 antagonist should be done in small increments to reach an appropriate target inr.</p><p>
 omeprazole (substrate of cyp2c19): concomitant administration of thelin with omeprazole 
 increased the omeprazole auc
 0-24 by 30%; cmax was unchanged. the change in auc was not considered clinically significant.</p><p>
 nelfinavir (substrate of cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5): concomitant administration of thelin with 
 nelfinavir did not clinically significant change the clearance of nelfinavir. the clearance of nelfinavir 
 was not clinically significant changed in one subject that was classified as a cyp2c19 poor 
 metabolizer.</p><p>
 ciclosporin a (substrate of cyp3a4/5): thelin coadministered with ciclosporin a did not change the 
 clearance of ciclosporin a. however, because of its effect on thelin pharmacokinetics, use of thelin 
 in patients receiving ciclosporin a is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 ketoconazole (substrate of cyp3a4/5): co-administration of thelin with ketoconazole did not 
 clinically significant change the clearance of ketoconazole.</p><p>
 nifedipine (substrate of cyp3a4/5): the clearance of nifedipine was not clinically significantly 
 changed when given concomitantly with sitaxentan sodium. this was tested for low-dose nifedipine 
 only. therefore, at higher nifedipine dosages an increase in exposure cannot be excluded.</p><p>6oral contraceptives: concomitant administration of thelin and ortho-novum 1/35 (1 mg norethindrone/ 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol) resulted in increases in exposure to ethinyl estradiol 
 (substrate of cyp3a4/5) and norethindrone (cyp3a4/5) of 59 % and 47%, respectively. thelin did 
 not affect the anti-ovulatory activity of the oral contraceptive as assessed by plasma concentrations of 
 fsh, lh, and progesterone.</p><p>
 sildenafil (substrate of cyp3a4): a single dose of sildenafil 100 mg coadministered with thelin 
 increased c
 max and auc∞ of sildenafil by 18% and 28%, respectively. there was no change in cmax or auc for the active metabolite, n-desmethylsildenafil. these changes in sildenafil plasma 
 concentrations were not considered clinically significant. interaction with sildenafil can be serious if 
 hypotension occurs beyond a safe level. study results suggest that the dose of sildenafil does not need 
 to be adjusted during concomitant administration with sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 digoxin (substrate of p-glycoprotein): concomitant administration of thelin did not alter the 
 pharmacokinetics of digoxin indicating no effect on the p-glycoprotein transporter.</p><p>
 no clinical interaction study was performed with a substrate of cyp 2c8. therefore an interaction 
 with such a drug cannot be excluded.</p><p>
 effects of other medicinal products on sitaxentan sodium</p><p>
 fluconazole (potent inhibitor of cyp2c19 and cyp2c9, and a moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4/5): 
 coadministration thelin and fluconazole had no effect on the clearance of sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 ketoconazole, and nelfinavir (potent inhibitor of cyp3a4/5): concomitant administration of thelin 
 and ketoconazole or nelfinavir did not clinically significant change the clearance of sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 ciclosporin a (potent inhibitor of p-gp and oatp): concomitant administration of thelin (100 mg 
 once daily) and ciclosporin a 3.5 mg/kg twice daily resulted in a 6-fold increase in the pre-dose 
 concentrations of sitaxentan sodium. the mechanism for this interaction is not known. however, it is 
 postulated that sitaxentan sodium is a substrate of the oatp transporter protein. use of thelin in 
 patients receiving ciclosporin a is contraindicated (see section 4.3). caution should be exercised when 
 administering thelin concurrently with other, more potent, oatp inhibitors. co-administration of 
 thelin with the moderate oatp inhibitor nelfinavir did not result in increased thelin plasma 
 concentrations.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy there are no human data regarding the use of sitaxentan sodium during pregnancy.</p><p>sitaxentan sodium 
 caused teratogenicity in rats (see section 5.3). potential effects in humans are unknown. thelin should 
 not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary i.e. in case no alternative treatment options are 
 available.</p><p>
 lactation 
 sitaxentan sodium was detected in the plasma of breast fed pups from female rats treated with 
 sitaxentan sodium, indicating that sitaxentan sodium was present in the breast milk. it is unknown 
 whether or not sitaxentan sodium is excreted into human milk. women should not breastfeed while 
 using thelin.</p><p>
 women of child-bearing potential 
 treatment must not be initiated in women of child-bearing potential unless they practice reliable 
 contraception, due to possible teratogenicity. if necessary, pregnancy testing should be undertaken.</p><p>7</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. a known undesirable effect is dizziness, which could influence the ability to drive or use machines.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 
 undesirable effects</header><p>within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. frequencies are reported as 
 very common (≥1/10), common (&gt;1/100, &lt;1/10), uncommon (&gt;1/1,000, ≤1/100), rare (&gt;1/10,000, ≤1/1,000), and very rare (≤1/10,000). at the recommended dose during placebo-controlled trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension, the most common adverse drug reactions 
 considered to be at least possibly related to thelin treatment were headache in 15% of patients, and 
 peripheral oedema and nasal congestion, each in 9% of patients. adverse drug reactions that occurred 
 in at least 2% of thelin patients, at a rate greater than placebo, and that were considered to be at least 
 possibly related to thelin treatment included:</p><p>

 oedema, and pt prolonged.</p><p>
 laboratory abnormalities</p><p>
 increased liver aminotransferases (see section 4.4) 
 elevations of ast and/or alt are associated with sitaxentan sodium. in phase 2 and 3 oral studies in 
 patients with pah, elevations in alt and/or ast &gt; 3 uln were observed in 5% of placebo-treated 
 patients (n=155) and 7% of thelin 100 mg-treated patients (n=887). elevations in alt values &gt; 5 
 uln were</p><p>4% (36/887) for sitaxentan 100 mg qd and 0.6% in the placebo group (1/155). elevation 
 of cases of symptomatic hepatitis has occurred in patients receiving thelin 100 mg once daily. one 
 fatal case has been reported with an initial dosage of sitaxentan of 600 mg/day.</p><p>
 decreased haemoglobin (see section 4.4) 
 the overall mean decrease in haemoglobin concentration for thelin -treated patients was 0.5 g/dl 
 (change to end of treatment). in placebo-controlled studies, marked decreases in haemoglobin (&gt; 15% 
 decrease from baseline with value &lt; lower limit of normal) were observed in 7% of patients treated 
 with thelin (n = 149) and 3% of placebo-treated patients (n = 155). a decrease in haemoglobin 
 concentration by at least 1 g/dl was observed in 60% of patients treated with thelin as compared to 
 32% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p> 8</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>there is no specific experience with the management of thelin overdose. in the event of overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed.</p><p>
 during clinical trials, thelin was given as a daily oral dose of 1000 mg/day for 7 days to healthy 
 volunteers. the most common adverse effects at this dose were headache, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p>
 in an open-label hypertension study, 10 patients received 480 mg twice daily (approximately a 10-fold 
 increase in daily dose compared to the mrhd) for up to 2 weeks. headaches (some severe), 
 peripheral oedema, and anaemias were the most common adverse events reported in these patients, 
 none of which were considered serious.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. pharmacological properties</header></section><section><header n="5.1">5.1  pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antihypertensives, atc code: not yet assigned</p><p>mechanism of action endothelin-1 (et-1) is a potent vascular paracrine and autocrine peptide in the lung, and can also 
 promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, and remodelling and is pro-inflammatory. 
 et-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial 
 hypertension, as well as other cardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, including 
 scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension, and 
 atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of et-1 in these diseases. in pulmonary arterial 
 hypertension and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin receptor antagonism, elevated et-1 
 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and prognosis of these diseases. additionally, 
 pulmonary arterial hypertension also is characterized by reduced nitric oxide activity.</p><p>
 et-1 actions are mediated through endothelin a receptors (eta), present on smooth muscle cells, and 
 endothelin b receptors (etb), present on endothelial cells. predominant actions of et-1 binding to 
 eta are vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling, while binding to etb results in et-1 clearance, 
 and vasodilatory/ antiproliferative effects due in part to nitric oxide and prostacyclin release.</p><p>
 thelin is a potent (ki 0.35 nm) and highly selective eta antagonist (approximately 6,500-fold more 
 selective for eta as compared to etb).</p><p>
 efficacy 
 two randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trials were conducted to demonstrate 
 efficacy. stride-1, which included 178 patients, compared 2 oral doses of thelin (100 mg once daily 
 and 300 mg once daily) with placebo during 12 weeks of treatment. the 18 week stride-2 trial, 
 conducted in 246 patients, included 4 treatment arms: placebo once daily, thelin 50 mg once daily, 
 thelin 100 mg once daily, and open-label bosentan twice daily (efficacy-rater blinded, administered 
 according to the approved package insert).</p><p>
 patients had moderate to severe (nyha/who functional class ii-iv) pulmonary arterial hypertension 
 resulting from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah, also known as primary pulmonary 
 hypertension), connective tissue disease (ctd), or congenital heart disease (chd).</p><p>
 in these studies, the study medicine was added to patients’ current therapy, which could have included 
 a combination of digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, oxygen, and vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel 
 blockers, ace inhibitors).</p><p>patients with pre-existent hepatic disease and patients using non-
 conventional pah treatments (e.g. iloprost) were excluded.</p><p>9sub-maximal exercise capacity was assessed by measuring distance walked in 6 minutes (6-minute walk test) at 12 weeks for stride-1 and 18 weeks for stride-2. in both trials, treatment with 
 thelin resulted in a significant increase in exercise capacity. the placebo-corrected increases in walk 
 distance compared to baseline were 35 metres (p=0.006; ancova) and 31 metres (p&lt;0.05; 
 ancova), respectively.</p><p>
 among patients with ctd, a statistically significant difference versus placebo was observed 
 (37.73 metres, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>
 a reduction in symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension was observed with thelin treatment. in 
 the stride-1 trial, 59 (33%) of the 178 patients were classified at baseline as nyha functional class 
 ii (mean baseline 6 minute walk distance 451 meters) and 117 (66%) as functional class iii (mean 
 baseline 6 minute walk distance 372 meters). treatment with thelin led to net improvement in nyha 
 functional class in 25% of patients (placebo 8%, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>in the stride-2 trial 93 (38%) of the 246 
 patients were classified at baseline as nyha functional class ii (mean baseline 6 minute walk 
 distance 370 meters) and 144 (59%) as functional class iii (mean baseline 6 minute walk distance 322 
 meters). treatment with thelin led to net improvement in who functional class in 12% of patients 
 (placebo -3%, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>
 haemodynamic parameters were assessed in stride-1. compared with placebo treatment, thelin 
 resulted in improvement (p&lt;0.05) in cardiac index of +0.3 l/min/m
 2 (13%), in pulmonary vascular resistance of-221 dynes*sec/cm
 5 (22%), and in systemic vascular resistance of -276 dynes*sec/cm5 (16%) after 12 weeks of treatment. the reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of 3 mmhg (6%) was not statistically significant.</p><p>
 the effect of thelin on the outcome of the disease is unknown. 
 long-term data 
 there are no studies to demonstrate beneficial effects on survival of treatment with sitaxentan sodium. 
 however, patients completing stride-2 were eligible to enroll in stride-2x, a 1-year open-label 
 study of thelin 100 mg. a total of 145 patients were treated with thelin 100 mg. in this total 
 population, kaplan-meier estimates of survival were 96% for patients after 1 year of therapy with 
 sitaxentan sodium. one-year survival estimates were similar in the subgroup of patients with pah 
 secondary to connective tissue disease for the thelin treated group (98%). the estimates may have 
 been influenced by the initiation of new or additional pah therapies, which occurred in 24% of 
 patients.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption</p><p>thelin is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. in pah patients, peak plasma concentrations

 distribution 
 thelin is more than 99% protein bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. the degree of 
 binding is independent of concentration in the clinically relevant range. sitaxentan sodium does not 
 penetrate into erythrocytes and does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>
 metabolism and elimination 
 following oral administration to healthy volunteers, sitaxentan sodium is highly metabolised. the 
 most common metabolic products are at least 10 times less potent as et
 a antagonists than sitaxentan sodium in a standard 
 in vitro test of activity. in vitro, sitaxentan sodium is metabolized by cyp2c9 and cyp3a4.</p><p>10in vitro studies using human liver microsomes or primary hepatocytes show that sitaxentan sodium inhibits cyp2c9, and, to a lesser extent, cyp 2c8, cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5.</p><p>
 approximately 50-60% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine with the remainder eliminated in the 
 faeces. less than 1% of the dose is excreted as unchanged active ingredient. the terminal elimination 
 half-life (t½) is 10 hours. steady state in volunteers is reached within about 6 days.</p><p>
 no unexpected accumulation in the plasma was observed after multiple dosing at the recommended 
 dose of 100 mg once daily. however, at doses of 300 mg or higher, non-linear pharmacokinetics result 
 in disproportionately higher plasma concentrations of sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>
 special populations 
 based on results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis and pooled pharmacokinetic data over 
 several studies, it was found that gender, race, and age do not clinically significantly affect the 
 pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>

 the influence of liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan sodium has not been 
 evaluated. refer to section 4.3</p></section><section><header n="">.   5.3 
 preclinical safety data</header><p>in repeated-dose toxicity studies, dose-related liver changes (weight, centrilobular hypertrophy, occasionally necrosis), induction of hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and slightly decreased 
 erythron parameters were seen in mice, rats and dogs. at high doses, dose-related increases in 
 prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) were also seen, most 
 prominently in rats, and coagulopathy (bleedings) in rats and dogs, but not mice. the significance of 
 these findings for humans is unknown.</p><p>
 testicular tubular atrophy was observed in rats, but not in mice or dogs.</p><p>in the 26-week study, 
 moderate to marked diffuse seminiferous tubular atrophy was present at a very low incidence, whereas 
 in the 99-week study there was a dose-related, slightly increased incidence of minimal to mild focal 
 atrophy at doses providing 29 to 94 times the human exposure.</p><p>
 reproduction toxicity has been evaluated in rats only. thelin did not affect fertility in males and 
 females.</p><p>
 thelin was teratogenic at the lowest tested dose in rats, corresponding to exposures more than 30 
 times the human exposure. dose-dependent malformations of the head, mouth, face and large blood 
 vessels occurred. a noael has not been established. administration of thelin to female rats from 
 late-pregnancy through lactation reduced pup survival, and caused testis tubular aplasia and delayed 
 vaginal opening at the lowest exposure tested (17 – 45 times the human exposure). large / abnormally 
 shaped livers, a delay in auditory function development, a delay in preputial separation and a reduction 
 in the number of embryonic implants occurred at higher maternal doses.</p><p>
 in vitro and in vivo tests on genetic toxicology did not provide any evidence for a clinically relevant genotoxic potential.</p><p>
 thelin was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 97-99 weeks or when administered to 
 p53(+/-) transgenic mice for 6 months.</p><p>11</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>tablet core: cellulose, microcrystalline (e460)

(see annex i: summary of product characteristics, section 4.2)</p><p>
 •</p></section><section><header>conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product</header><p>the mah shall set up a surveillance programme to collect information on: the demographics of patients prescribed thelin, any adverse reactions and reasons for discontinuation of thelin. details of 
 such a surveillance programme should be agreed with the national competent authorities in each 
 member state and put in place prior to marketing of the product.</p><p>
 the mah must agree the details of a controlled distribution system with the national competent 
 authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that, prior to prescribing, all 
 doctors who intend to prescribe thelin are provided with a physician information pack containing the 
 following: 
 • product information • physician information about thelin • patient information card • partner of patient information card</p><p>
 the physician information about thelin should contain the following key elements: 
 • that thelin is teratogenic o use of effective contraception in women of child bearing age o possible interaction with oral contraceptives and increased risk of thromboembolism o need to advise female patients about teratogenicity, contraception, if necessary the need for pregnancy testing and what to do if they become pregnant 
 o referral of patients who become pregnant to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology and its diagnosis for evaluation and advice</p><p>
 • that thelin is hepatotoxic o need for liver function tests prior to and during treatment o contraindication in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease o discontinue sitaxentan sodium immediately if liver enzymes rise above 5 × uln o need for close monitoring if liver enzymes measure &gt; 3 and ≤5 × uln, with repeat analysis every two weeks until values return to pre-treatment levels or discontinuation if 
 analysis rises above 5 × uln.</p><p>
 • that treatment with thelin often causes a decrease in haemoglobin and related red cell parameters o need for full blood count prior to use and monitoring at clinically appropriate intervals</p><p>15• effect of thelin on bleeding o interaction with warfarin and vitamin k antagonists leading to an increased inr o need to decrease established dose of vitamin k antagonist upon starting sitaxentan therapy 
 o start vitamin k antagonists treatment at a reduced dose if already on sitaxentan sodium o need for regular monitoring of inr o be aware of the potential for haemorrhage and investigate as appropriate o increased risk of epistaxis and gingival bleeding</p><p>
 • that there is an interaction with ciclosporin a which may lead to higher blood concentration of thelin and hence an increased risk of adverse reactions.</p><p>
 • that the safety database of thelin is limited and physicians are encouraged to enrol patients in a surveillance programme to increase knowledge about the incidence of important adverse drug 
 reactions (adrs). the surveillance programme should prompt doctors to report serious adrs and 
 certain selected adrs as below immediately and other non-serious adrs at three monthly 
 intervals.</p><p>
 the information collected should include: 
 o anonymised patient details – age, sex and aetiology of pah o concomitant medications o reason for discontinuation o adrs o all serious adrs o increase in hepatic enzymes to &gt;3 × uln o anaemia o haemorrhage o pregnancy and outcome o pulmonary oedema (associated with veno-occlusive disease) o suspected interactions o unexpected adrs according to the spc.</p><p>
 the patient information card should include the following information 
 • that thelin is teratogenic • the need to ensure that women of child bearing age are using effective contraception and that patients should inform their doctors of any possibility of pregnancy before a new prescription is 
 issued 
 • the need for female patients to contact their treating doctor immediately if they suspect that they might be pregnant. 
 • that thelin is hepatotoxic and they will need to attend for regular blood tests • the need to tell their doctor about any adverse events • the need to tell their doctor that they are taking thelin</p><p>
 partner of patient information card should include the following information: 
 • that thelin is teratogenic and that women of child bearing age must use effective contraception</p></section><section><header>other conditions</header><p>the mah must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.</p><p>
