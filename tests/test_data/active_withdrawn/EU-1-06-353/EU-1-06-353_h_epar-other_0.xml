 iin this application, the mah re-evaluated data from two 
 previously submitted pivotal studies: stride 1 (fph01) 
 and stride 2 (fph02), as well as data from study 
 stride 4, to support an extension of indication in 
 pulmonary arterial hypertension who functional class 
 (fc) ii.</p><p>
 further to the assessment of the submitted data, the 
 chmp considered that efficacy data to support an 
 extension of the indication in section 4.1 of the summary 
 of product characteristics (spc) to who fc ii patients 
 was insufficient. results of the 6-minute walk test were 
 not statistically significant, while data on the effect on 
 clinical worsening were based from a post-hoc analysis 
 which also failed to show statistical significance. benefit 
 seen on fc and haemodynamics are supportive, but 
 insufficient. however, the chmp considered acceptable to 
 include in section 5.1 of the spc of the results of stride 
 4 study, relevant haemodynamic data, effect on 
 functional class and updated long-term survival data as 
 the information can be useful to the prescriber.</p><p>

 the increased risk of bleeding with thelin, mainly in the 
 form of epistaxis and gingival bleeding, has been 
 reflected in the spc through the addition of a warning 
 (section 4.4) and an update of section 4.8, to add 
 gingival bleeding as a common undesirable effect.</p><p>
 regarding the risks of thelin associated with pregnancy, 
 the following warning has been added to section 4.4 of 
 the spc and section 4.6 has been updated accordingly: 
 &quot;due to possible teratogenicity, the treatment must not 
 be initiated in women of child-bearing potential unless 
 they practice reliable contraception. if necessary, 
 pregnancy testing should be undertaken (see section 
 4.6).</p><p>
 the conditions and restrictions with regard to the safe 
 and effective use of the medicinal product introduced in 
 the rmp have been updated in annex ii.
