 1.1. 
 introduction</header><p>thelin contains sitaxentan sodium, which is an endothelin receptor antagonist, with higher selectivity for the eta receptor than the etb receptor subtype. endothelin-1 (et-1) is a potent vascular 
 paracrine and autocrine peptide in the lung, and can also promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac 
 hypertrophy and remodeling, and is pro-inflammatory. et-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and 
 lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah), as well as other cardiovascular 
 disorders and connective tissue diseases, including scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, 
 myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension, and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of et-
 1 in these diseases. in pah and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin receptor antagonism, 
 elevated et-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and prognosis of these diseases. 
 additionally, pah is also characterised by reduced nitric oxide activity. et-1 actions are mediated 
 through endothelin a receptors (eta), present on smooth muscle cells, and endothelin b receptors 
 (etb), present on endothelial cells. predominant actions of et-1 binding to eta are vasoconstriction 
 and vascular remodelling, while binding to etb results in et-1 clearance, and vasodilatory/ 
 antiproliferative effects due in part to nitric oxide and prostacyclin release.</p><p>thelin was granted a marketing authorisation by the european commission on 10 august 2006 and is 
 indicated for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as who 
 functional class iii, to improve exercise capacity. efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary 
 hypertension and in pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease.</p><p>
 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries, characterized by 
 vascular proliferation and remodelling. it results in a progressive increase in pulmonary arterial 
 resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular failure and death. the functional classification (fc) of 
 pah according to clinical parameters modified from the new york heart association (nyha) 
 classification of patients with cardiac disease, is as follows:</p><p>
  class i: pah without a resulting limitation of physical activity. ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope. 
  class ii: pah resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. the patient is comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near 
 syncope. 
  class iii: pah resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. the patient is comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near 
 syncope. 
  class iv: pah resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. the patient has signs of right heart failure. dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at 
 rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</p><p>
 it has been shown that patients who improve from functional class iii or class iv to functional class ii 
 after treatment have significantly improved survival. therefore, it might be reasonable to expect that 
 early treatment of who functional class ii patients might provide an improvement in survival as 
 progression to functional class iii might be delayed. furthermore, early treatment of functional class ii 
 patients is supported by the finding that not all patients respond to treatment and if treatment initiation 
 is delayed until the patient progresses to functional class iii or iv, a significant proportion will remain 
 in functional class iii or class iv.</p><p>
 until recently, no therapeutic options were available in the eu for who/nyha functional class ii 
 patients. in 2008, ambrisentan (volibris) was approved as a new chemical entity for both functional 
 class ii and iii patients, and bosentan (tracleer) had its functional class iii label extended to include 
 benefit in functional class ii patients. the basis to include who functional class ii patients were on 
 two grounds: 
 1.</p><p>the functional class ii subjects recruited into the trials were a demonstrably different 
 population from the functional class iii subjects; 
 2.</p><p>efficacy was demonstrated for both functional class ii and class iii subjects.</p><p>
 2 medicinal product no longer authorisedsildenafil (revatio) and tadalafil (adcirca) have also received recent approvals in functional class ii.</p><p>
 in this type ii variation, the marketing authorisation holder (mah) applied to extend section 4.1 of 
 the summary of product characteristics (spc) with the statement “
 some improvements have also been shown in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) who functional class ii (see section 
 5.1)
 ” and to amend section 5.1 of the spc with updated information by functional class (fc) and updated long term survival data.</p><p>
 further to the assessment of the data submitted in the variation application and in the responses to the 
 chmp requests for supplementary information, the chmp considered that efficacy data to support an 
 extension of the indication in section 4.1 of the spc to who fc ii patients was insufficient. results 
 of the 6-minute walk test were not statistically significant, while data on the effect on clinical 
 worsening were based from a post-hoc analysis which also failed to show statistical significance. 
 benefit seen on fc and haemodynamics are supportive, but insufficient. however, the chmp 
 considered acceptable to include relevant haemodynamic data in section 5.1 of the spc as the 
 information can be useful to the prescriber.</p></section><section><header n="1.2">1.2.  
 clinical aspects</header><p>no new clinical studies were included to support this type ii variation. the mah re-evaluated data from two previously submitted pivotal studies: stride 1 (fph01) and stride 2 (fph02), to 
 support the requested changes with regard to who fc ii. the mah believed that who fc ii 
 subjects have been adequately studied in these trials.</p><p>
 the mah also referred to two other medicinal products, namely ambrisentan and bosentan, which are 
 indicated for who fc ii patients. the mah was convinced that the considerations of ambrisentan 
 and bosentan can now be similarly applied to the sitaxentan data.</p></section><section><header n="1.2.1">1.2.1.  clinical efficacy</header></section><section><header n="1.2.1.1">1.2.1.1. main studies</header><p>data from two pivotal studies, stride 1 and stride 2 with supporting safety information from the extension study stride 2x (fph02x) and long term survival data for subjects in stride 2 were 
 included in the submission.</p><p>
 patients from study stride 2x were eligible to enter a long-term open-label study stride 3 
 (fph03). survival status in this study together with the survival status of patients who were included 
 in studies stride 2 and stride 2x but did not enter study stride 3 was also included.</p><p>
 at the request of the chmp, the mah also submitted the results of study stride 4.</p><p>
 </p></section><section><header>methods and baseline  stride-1</header><p> included 3 groups (sitaxentan 100 mg, sitaxentan 300 mg, placebo dosed orally once daily) of approximately 60 subjects with fc ii-iv per group, treated in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. 
 the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in percent of predicted peak 
 oxygen uptake (vo
 2). according to the mah, the primary endpoint was chosen at the time (early 2001) in order to address the concern that the standard use of the 450-meter upper limit for 6-minute 
 walk distance (6-mwd) would exclude many of the functional class ii from the study. at the time, 
 cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) was felt to be a more sensitive indicator of change in pah 
 patients; however, it remains a difficult endpoint in a multicenter trial due to technical difficulties in 
 performing and standardizing the testing.</p><p>
 the secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk test (6-mwt), who functional class, time to 
 clinical worsening and haemodynamic measures. the inclusion/exclusion criteria did not include any 
 constraint on distance walked in the 6-mwt.</p></section><section><header>stride-2</header><p> included 4 arms of approximately 60 subjects with fc ii-iv per arm: placebo, sitaxentan 50 mg, sitaxentan 100 mg, treated in a double-blind fashion for 18 weeks; in addition, a fourth arm of 
 3 medicinal product no longer authorisedopen-label bosentan 62.5 mg for 1 month, followed by 125 mg for the duration of the study, consistent with the approved labelling for bosentan, was included. the 6-mwt was the primary endpoint, while 
 who functional class, time to clinical deterioration, and borg dyspnoea score were secondary 
 endpoints. subjects were included in stride 2 if they could walk between 150 and 450 meters at 
 baseline on the 6-mwt.</p><p>

 achieved in the measurement of 6-mwt. as a result, only who functional class iii labelling was 
 considered for sitaxentan. the concerns regarding the representativeness of the who fc ii population 
 in the sitaxentan study population were based on a publication in 2000 by miyamoto

 when both clinical studies are combined, nearly half of the patients (47%) with functional class ii had 
 a 6mwd&gt;400m compared with 26.9% of patients with functional class iii (when both clinical trials

 one case of hospitalisation in the sitaxentan sodium 100mg arm. in fciii patients the proportion of 
 patients who were hospitalised was 50% and 35% in the bosentan and sitaxentan sodium 100mg 
 treatment groups, respectively.</p></section><section><header n="1.2.1.2">1.2.1.2  discussion on clinical efficacy</header><p>no new clinical studies were submitted to support this application.</p><p> 
 ambrisentan and bosentan (both endothelin receptor antagonists) are currently registered for pah fc 
 ii based on the results of studies aries-1/aries-2 and the early study, respectively. the aries 
 studies were 12 week double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter studies in 394 pah patients (both 
 fc ii and iii) with as primary endpoint: 6-mwt. the early study was a 6 month double-blind 
 placebo-controlled study in 168 pah who fc ii patients with as primary endpoints: pulmonary 
 vascular resistance (% from baseline), 6-mwt (% from baseline). one of the secondary endpoints was 
 time to clinical worsening.</p><p>
 the rationale for extending the indication to who fc ii for both bosentan and ambrisentan is 
 presented above. extrapolating efficacy from one endothelin receptor antagonist to the other is not 
 possible.</p><p>
 with the publishing of the french registry of pah patients (humbert et al., 2006) based on data from 
 674 patients, lower 6-mwt values were assigned for fc ii than those previously reported in the 
 article by miyamoto et al., 2000: 415m vs 450 m respectively. the values reported in the french 
 registry are currently the accepted ones. accordingly, re-evaluating data shown above from stride-
 1 and stride-2 provides evidence that pah fc ii and iii subjects were clinically distinguishable 
 populations regarding the 6-mwt, comparable to those recruited in the ambrisentan and bosentan 
 studies. the use of concomitant medications in fciii was more than in fc ii, which further supports 
 the differentiation of these functional classes at baseline in stride-1 and stride-2 studies. the 
 submitted data support that recruited pah patients in stride-1 and stride-2 had statistically 
 different haemodynamic values for who fc ii and iii.</p><p>
 in both sitaxentan studies, the placebo-corrected changes in the 6-mwt at week 12 for who fc ii 
 were not statistically significant, which constitutes a major objection to the extension of the indication 
 to this fc. stride-1 and stride-2 recruited 16 and 35 patients in fc ii respectively. the results of 
 the 6-mwt presented at eot (+20 m and +11.3 for stride-1 and stride-2 respectively) compare 
 better than the results at week 12 for both studies (+20m and +6m respectively). still the results are 
 not reassuring considering that stride-2 was the larger study. the results of the sitaxentan arm in 
 general (inclusive fc ii and iii) and specifically for who fc iii as shown in table 7 on the other 
 hand are statistically and clinically significant, which is the basis for the registration of sitaxentan for 
 the corresponding class.</p><p>
 analysis of the 6-mwt using different cut-offs support the previous results. there is a statistically 
 and clinically relevant improvement in the 6-mwt test in patients in the more severe pah patients 
 after 12 weeks in the sitaxentan treatment group, but not in the patients with milder disease. this again 
 supports the previous conclusion. on the other hand, the administration of ambrisentan consistently 
 resulted in significant improvements whatever the cut-off used.</p><p>
 in stride-1, sitaxentan administration resulted in statistically significant haemodynamic changes in 
 who fc ii, though obviously less than those achieved for who fc iii. haemodynamic 
 measurements are not generally accepted as primary endpoints in pah clinical studies and their role 
 are mainly in phase ii studies to investigate the mechanism of action or the dose response relationship.</p><p>
 in pah patients with fc ii at baseline, improvements in fc were only significant in stride-2; 
 sitaxentan did not show significant improvements in fc in stride-1 and -4. however, pooling of the 
 14 medicinal product no longer authorised3 studies improve the results, leading to significant improvement in fc. the robustness of such pooling/results is questioned specially in light of the opposite direction of the results of the 6-mwt. 
 the results are generally supportive as the improvement of who fc is not considered as a robust 
 primary endpoint. in addition, no formal statistical analysis was conducted.</p><p>
 ttcw was assessed in stride-1,-2 and -4 as a secondary endpoint, though with different definitions 
 in each study. for the sake of consistency, the mah conducted an analysis using a single definition in 
 line with that defined in the draft chmp guideline for pah.</p><p>the results generally show significant 
 benefit in the whole cohort studied, but this was primarily due to a benefit in fc iii.</p><p>for fc ii, no 
 statistical significance can be shown using any method of analysis (individual studies or pooled data). 
 this could have been expected considering the relatively short duration of the studies (stride-1,-2 
 and -4) which varied between 12 and 18 weeks. the numerical benefit that was noted in fc ii 
 compared to placebo (overall 6 vs. 2 events) are mainly driven by</p><p>less worsening of fc as other 
 endpoints (death, hospitalisation) did not occur. no robust conclusions can be drawn on such data 
 considering the post-hoc analysis.</p></section><section><header n="1.2.2">1.2.2 clinical safety</header><p>safety database for who fc ii patients is based on patients recruited in stride 1 and stride 2/stride 2x studies. the use of sitaxentan in these patients was well tolerated. generally, sitaxentan

 day 1 for the survival analysis was the first day of sitaxentan treatment.</p><p>when analyzed by original treatment group in stride 2 for sensitivity analysis, the kaplan-meier survival rate for sitaxentan 100 mg group was 100%, 100%, and 87.0% at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, 
 respectively, for the functional class ii patients and 94.1%, 77.8%, and 71.0% at 1 year, 2 years and

 class in stride 2. the results indicate that the long term survival was associated with functional 
 class at baseline (hazard ratio 2.12; p=0.0246). however, an improvement in who functional class 
 did not appear to improve survival. this implies that an improvement in who functional class iii to 
 functional class ii does not afford the same survival benefit as maintaining patients in who functional 
 class ii. therefore patients should be offered efficacious therapy whilst still in functional class ii 
 before they deteriorate to who functional class iii.</p><p>
 this evidence suggests that administration of sitaxentan 100 mg to functional class ii subjects delays 
 disease progression and subsequent deterioration to class iii, and survival is improved.</p><p>
 </p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the presented safety data do not indicate a safety signal when sitaxentan is used in who fc ii, however the numbers are too low to draw robust conclusions.</p></section><section><header n="1.3">1.3. benefit/risk assessment and recommendation</header><p>pah is a rare and devastating disease. owing to the difficulties associated with the diagnosis, many patients will have progressed to who fc iii or even iv before treatment is offered. nevertheless, 
 about 25% of pah patients seen in the clinic are classified as who fc ii or less at the time of 
 diagnosis.</p><p>recently, it has been recognized that pah patients in who fc ii may benefit from 
 specialized pah therapy. ambrisentan, bosentan, sildenafil and tadalafil have been recently approved 
 for this indication (ref. respective epars).</p><p>
 the mah did not submit new clinical data. clinical data from previously submitted studies were re-
 evaluated. this data showed that patients with who fc ii were adequately distinguished from who 
 fc iii in the stride-1 and stride-2 studies, mainly based on the baseline values of the 6-mwt 
 and haemodynamic measurements. the recruited who fc ii patients appeared comparable to those 
 recruited in the corresponding ambrisentan and bosentan trials and the french registry.</p><p>
 the benefit in fc ii was re-assessed based on the stride-1, -2 and -4 studies, in addition to 
 stride-2x. the 6-mwt was the primary endpoint in most of these studies; time to clinical 
 worsening, improvement in functional class and haemodynamic data were assessed in some studies as 
 secondary endpoints.</p><p>
 both the 6-mwt and ttcw are considered relevant primary endpoints in pah trials. sitaxentan 
 administration did not result in a significant improvement in 6 mwt in patients with fc ii in any of 
 the stride studies. only a trend was observed in stride-1 (+20 m) and stride-2 (+11.3 m) and 
 no difference in stride-4. regarding ttcw, events were very low, differences with placebo not 
 significant and primarily related to less worsening in fc. sitaxentan resulted in significant 
 improvement of functional class in fc ii in only one study (stride-2) or when all data were pooled. 
 haemodynamic data were positive in the one study in which it was investigated (stride 1), and 
 event-free survival was shown to be better than bosentan based on exploratory data. no safety issues 
 were identified with long term use of sitaxentan in pah patients in who fc ii. however, the 
 numbers are too low to draw robust conclusions.</p><p>
 in summary, the totality of the data with respect to fc ii did not support a positive assessment, 
 considering that the main efficacy endpoints were not significantly improved and only some 
 improvement in fc did occur. this was further complicated by the inconsistency of the results across 
 studies precluding any robust conclusions on efficacy. it should be noted that for the other endothelin-
 receptor antagonists registered for fc ii, the indication was approved on the basis of a significant 
 improvement in the 6 minute walking distance (ambrisentan) or a positive trend in this test, together 
 with improvement in haemodynamic data and time to clinical worsening (bosentan).</p><p>
 17 medicinal product no longer authorised18 in conclusion, the extension of indication in section 4.1 to include fc ii was not acceptable. based on the above post-hoc analysis, the results for ttcw were shown to be significant for fc iii and the 
 mah proposed to include such data in section 5.1 of the spc. this was not considered acceptable. 
 data in section 5.1 of the spc should be balanced and based on sound statistical methods, which was 
 not the case as neither pooling nor hierarchical analysis of secondary endpoints were pre-specified. 
 the presented data are considered descriptive but not robust enough to be included in section 5.1 of 
 the spc.</p><p>
 however, the chmp considered acceptable to include in section 5.1 of the spc of the results of 
 stride 4 study, relevant haemodynamic data, effect on functional class and updated long-term 
 survival data as the information can be useful to the prescriber.</p><p>
