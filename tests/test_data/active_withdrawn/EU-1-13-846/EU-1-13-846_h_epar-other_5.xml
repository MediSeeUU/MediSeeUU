 scientific discussion</header><p>worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men [globocan, 2012].</p><p>prostate cancer growth is dependent on androgens, and androgen deprivation 
 therapy (i.e. treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [lhrh] analogue or bilateral 
 orchiectomy) is the cornerstone of treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p>although initial 
 response rates are high, the disease can progress despite castrate levels of testosterone at which point 
 it is considered castration resistant. castration resistant prostate cancer (crpc) represents a lethal 
 transition in the natural history of prostate cancer, with most patients dying of disease progression.</p><p> 
 while the precise mechanism through which tumours progress from being castration sensitive to 
 castration resistant is unknown,</p><p>a key step may include the development of continuous activation of 
 androgen signalling.</p><p>this activation may arise through androgen receptor gene amplification, 
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/607459/2014 
 page 6/92</p><p>
 androgen receptor overexpression, androgen receptor mutations, and/or aberrant androgen receptor co-regulation [scher &amp; sawyers, 2005].</p><p>in addition, studies have shown that tumour cells display 
 increased sensitivity to androgen mediated cell growth and intra-tumoral production of androgens.</p><p>
 these findings suggest that despite androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor signalling 
 remains an important mediator of tumour cell growth in crpc and as such, treatment strategies that 
 target the androgen receptor may have important therapeutic potential.</p><p> 
 the treatment of patients with metastatic crpc often includes anti-androgens such as bicalutamide, 
 nilutamide, or flutamide; however, these agents have the potential to stimulate androgen receptor 
 signalling and can accelerate tumour cell growth [bohl et al, 2005].</p><p>immunotherapy with sipuleucel-t 
 was shown to be associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared 
 with placebo in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic crpc [kantoff et al, 
 2010]; however, this therapy was not associated with improvement in other markers of disease 
 progression such as objective radiographic response or prostate specific antigen (psa) response. in 
 2012, abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) plus prednisone was shown to significantly improve 
 radiographic progression free survival (rpfs) in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy 
 naïve patients with metastatic crpc compared with prednisone alone. a strong trend toward 
 improvement in overall survival was observed in that study, but results did not meet statistical 
 significance [ryan et al, 2013].</p><p>recently, radium ra 223 dichloride (radium 223) was shown to 
 improve overall survival in the chemotherapy naïve subgroup in a study enrolling patients with 
 metastatic crpc and symptomatic bone metastases [parker et al, 2013].</p><p> 
 over time, patients with metastatic crpc generally experience continued disease progression, 
 worsening pain, and become eligible for chemotherapy.</p><p>although first line chemotherapy with 
 docetaxel plus prednisone demonstrated a survival benefit in these patients [tannock et al, 2004], its 
 use leads to substantial morbidity from severe neutropenia, diarrhoea, and other toxicities.</p><p>other 
 treatment options that have demonstrated a survival improvement in patients with metastatic crpc 
 after docetaxel include cabazitaxel plus prednisone [de bono et al, 2010], abiraterone plus prednisone 
 [de bono et al, 2011], and enzalutamide [scher et al, 2012].</p><p> 
 because of its potential side effects many patients are denied chemotherapy.</p><p>recently published data 
 from the swedish prostate cancer database indicate that the majority of men younger than 70-years-
 old with crpc were treated with chemotherapy.</p><p>in contrast, only half as many men between 70- and 
 79-years-old received chemotherapy.</p><p>in addition, chemotherapy was often administered shortly prior 
 to death [lissbrant et al, 2013].</p></section><section><header n="2.1">2.1.  
 introduction</header><p>enzalutamide (xtandi) is an oral androgen receptor signalling inhibitor designed to block multiple steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. in non-clinical studies, enzalutamide competitively 
 inhibited androgen induced receptor activation in the cytosol, inhibited nuclear translocation of 
 activated androgen receptors, and inhibited the association of the activated androgen receptor with 
 chromatin, even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells 
 resistant to anti-androgens. in addition, enzalutamide treatment decreased the growth of prostate 
 cancer cells and induced cancer cell death and tumour regression.</p><p> 
 the clinical benefit of enzalutamide has been shown in patients with metastatic castration resistant 
 prostate cancer (crpc) who previously received docetaxel based chemotherapy in the phase 3 study, 
 crpc2 (affirm).</p><p>treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily resulted in a statistically 
 significant and clinically relevant reduction of the risk of death (37% relative risk reduction) compared 
 with patients receiving placebo. an improvement in the median overall survival of 4.8 months was 
 observed. time to psa progression and radiologic progression free survival were also significantly

 improved in favour of active treatment and time to first skeletal-related event also favoured mdv3100. overall, the benefits of mdv3100 in mcrpc patients who had progressed after 1 or 2 chemotherapy 
 regimens at least one containing docetaxel appeared clear, robust and of clinical relevance. the safety 
 profile was considered acceptable and generally manageable with basic medical interventions (diuretics 
 and antihypertensive medication). toxicities were generally mild, and resulted in infrequent dose 
 reductions, dose interruptions, or discontinuations. 
 the european commission issued a decision to grant marketing authorisation for xtandi on 21 june 
 2013 for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose 
 disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy. 
 the present application is intended to extend the indication of enzalutamide to include the treatment of 
 adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who are asymptomatic or mildly 
 symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically 
 indicated. 
 scientific advice was received from the chmp on the design of the pivotal study mdv3100-03 
 (prevail) to the present application in june 2010 (ema/chmp/sawp/372658/2010). the chmp was in 
 general agreement with the proposed study design (e.g. placebo arm, inclusion/ exclusion criteria) and 
 agreed with the use of overall survival and rpfs as co-primary endpoints. the study could be 
 considered positive if one of the co-primary endpoints was positive in favour of enzalutamide, as long 
 as the treatment effects were favourable on both endpoints. concern was expressed that an early 
 submission based on rpfs data alone could jeopardize the final os analysis.</p></section><section><header n="2.2">2.2.  
 non-clinical aspects</header><p>no new non-clinical data have been submitted within this application, which was considered acceptable by the chmp.</p></section><section><header n="2.2.1">2.2.1.  
 ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>the mah has provided a justification for the absence of an era, which was considered acceptable (see below).</p></section><section><header n="2.2.2">2.2.2.  
 discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects</header><p>as part of the initial marketing application, the applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment on the active ingredient enzalutamide. the era included a phase i assessment. the calculation of 
 predicted environmental concentration in surface water covered all metastatic prostate cancer 
 including chemotherapy-naïve metastatic crpc. the calculated pec
 surfacewater value was 0.0084 µg/l. the chmp considered that the new indication is covered by the existing era.</p><p>
 further data was considered needed at the time of initial marketing authorisation to conclude 
 definitively on the potential risk of enzalutamide to the environment. the applicant was recommended 
 to conduct the fish early life cycle test (oecd 210) and the fish sexual development test (oecd 234). 
 these studies are ongoing and the final reports are expected to be available by june 2015. until these 
 reports are available, the more restrictive wording agreed at the time of initial marketing authorisation 
 is kept in section 6.6 of the smpc regarding disposal of enzalutamide.

 cmin concentrations of enzalutamide remained relatively constant beginning at approximately week 4 (11.8 μg/ml, cv 20.8%), indicating attainment of steady-state. c
 min concentrations of the sum of enzalutamide plus m2 remained relatively constant beginning at approximately week 9 (23.7 μg/ml, 
 cv 20.4%). similarly, c
 min concentrations of m1 and m2 remained relatively constant beginning at approximately week 9 (8.4 μg/ml, cv 87.1% and 12.1 μg/ml, cv 25.8%, respectively), indicating 
 attainment of steady-state. cmin concentrations of enzalutamide and m2 were similar at week 9 (11.6 
 and 12.1 μg/ml, respectively) and at all-time points thereafter.</p></section><section><header>study mdv3100-03</header><p>study mdv3100-03 (prevail) was a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety study of enzalutamide administered at 160 mg/day orally to patients 
 with metastatic crpc who were chemotherapy-naïve. patients had to be asymptomatic or mildly 
 symptomatic at study entry, and not have previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy. patients were 
 randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide or placebo. randomization was central and stratified by 
 investigative site. 
 pre-dose c
 min samples were collected from all patients at weeks 5, 13, and 25, and at adverse event-related, unscheduled visits prior to week 25. plasma samples from enzalutamide-treated patients were 
 analysed for enzalutamide, m1, and m2. based on the time to reach steady state (28 days for 
 enzalutamide and 56 days for m1 and m2), week 13 was selected for pharmacokinetic summary 
 statistics. for the purpose of exposure-response analyses for safety, week 13 data were used to define 
 steady-state c
 min values; if a week 13 cmin value was not available, then alternative qualifying cmin values were considered based on a systematic hierarchy. steady-state c
 min data were examined for relationships with selected demographic characteristics at baseline (age, weight) and safety endpoints (common adverse events, adverse events of interest). for 
 these analyses, c
 min values for enzalutamide, m2, and the sum of enzalutamide plus m2 were classified into 4 categories (quartiles) by rank order for enzalutamide-treated patients and 1 category (c
 min = 0) for placebo-treated patients. the statistical methodology was similar to the methodology used for

 results from the pivotal study (mdv3100-03), showed that the mean steady-state cmin values were 
 12.8 ± 3.20 µg/ml for enzalutamide, 6.56 ± 4.97 µg/ml for m1, 13.0 ± 3.58 µg/ml for m2, and 25.7 
 ± 5.30 µg/ml for enzalutamide plus m2. as expected based on prior data, enzalutamide and m2 
 circulate at approximately the same plasma concentrations, and the coefficient of variability is low 
 (25.1% for enzalutamide and 27.6% for m2). 
 due to the use of a single dosing regimen in all patients (160 mg/day) and the low pharmacokinetic 
 variability, the quartile ranges were narrow. for example, the median values of neighbouring quartiles 
 never differed by more than 25%, and the overall difference in the median cmin concentrations of 
 lowest and highest quartiles did not exceed 1.78-fold. narrow ranges of the exposure quartiles also 
 occurred in study crpc2 (affirm) and limited the ability to demonstrate clear exposure-response 
 relationships. 
 the summary statistics provided from study mdv3100-03 (mean and median) suggested a positive 
 relationship with increasing exposure in all 3 groups (enzalutamide, m2, and the sum of enzalutamide 
 plus m2) with increasing age, and a negative relationship with increasing exposure in the 3 groups with 
 decreasing baseline weight. for both age and weight, the ranges (min, max) were overlapping among 
 the quartiles. the trends in the means and medians for these covariates were consistent with results in 
 the initial marketing application; however, as shown in a population pharmacokinetic model in the 
 initial marketing application, the impact of these covariates on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was 
 small and not clinically meaningful when compared to inter-individual and residual variability, and dose 
 adjustments were not warranted for either age or weight. 
 based on the exposure-response analyses for safety, no clinically meaningful and statistically 
 significant differences between exposure groups were noted for any individual adverse event. in 
 addition, no adverse event of clinical interest had consistent statistically significant findings in pairwise 
 odds ratio comparisons between exposure quartiles in enzalutamide, m2, and enzalutamide plus m2.</p><p>
 taken as a whole, these exposure-response analyses showed no clear or consistent exposure-response 
 relationship between enzalutamide, m2, or enzalutamide plus m2 exposure and any single adverse 
 event, which is identical to the results for study crpc2 (affirm) in the original marketing application.</p></section><section><header n="2.3.4">2.3.4.

 a total of 140 patients with metastatic crpc (whereof 65 chemotherapy-naïve patients and 75 patients who had received prior chemotherapy) were enrolled. enzalutamide doses of 30, 60, 150, 240, 360, 
 480, and 600 mg/day were studied in 7 dose cohorts. 
 this antitumor activity was demonstrated consistently across a number of efficacy endpoints: 
 - psa decreases occurred at all doses and in men with and without previous chemotherapy. the extent 
 and proportion of patients showing psa decreases appeared to be dose-dependent from 30 mg to 150 
 mg daily, but reached a plateau between 150 mg and 240 mg daily, above which were seen no 
 additional effects. 
 - the median time to psa progression was not reached in patients without previous chemotherapy. the 
 median time to psa progression was 316 days (10.4 months) in patients with previous chemotherapy. 
 - in patients with measurable disease at study entry, 22/31, or 71%, of those without previous 
 chemotherapy had partial responses or stable disease in radiographically evident soft tissue and bone 
 lesions. in patients with previous chemotherapy and measurable disease, 23/42, or 55%, had partial 
 responses or stable disease. 
 - in patients with favourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline, mdv3100 therapy was 
 associated with maintenance of favourable circulating tumour cell counts in almost 80% of patients. in 
 patients with unfavourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline, mdv3100 therapy was associated 
 with conversion to favourable circulating tumour cell counts in 69% of patients without previous 
 chemotherapy and in 30% of men with previous chemotherapy. 
 - mdv3100 therapy was associated with decreases in levels of markers of bone turnover. of men 
 without previous chemotherapy, 87% had decreases in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and 71% 
 had decreases in urinary n-telopeptide. of men with previous chemotherapy, 66% had decreases in 
 bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and 43% had decreases in urinary n-telopeptide.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.2">2.4.2.

 after treatment discontinuation, whichever was first. 
 radiographic disease progression was evaluated by ct scan or mri and radionuclide bone scans at 
 weeks 9, 17, 25, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. radiographic disease progression in bone (2 or 
 more new lesions on radionuclide bone scan) observed at week 9 required 2 additional new lesions on 
 a confirmatory scan at least 6 weeks later; radiographic disease progression in bone observed after 
 week 9 required persistence of 2 new lesions on a confirmatory scan at least 6 weeks later. 
 radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of 
 analysis, although study sites were requested to obtain confirmatory soft tissue scans through week 
 13. scheduled and confirmatory scans had a ± 1-week window for completion. 
 radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using recist 
 1.1 for soft tissue disease and the pcwg2 guidelines for bone disease as defined in a separate imaging 
 review charter until at least the first 410 rpfs events were confirmed. subsequently, radiographic 
 progression was assessed by local radiology review per recist 1.1 and prostate cancer clinical trials 
 working group 2 (pcwg2). continued radiographic imaging was not required after radiographic 
 progression was confirmed. independent radiology reviewers (2 for soft tissue and 2 for nuclear 
 medicine) read images in a blinded fashion. if there was disagreement between either the 2

 absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/ml above the nadir was documented, and confirmed by a second 
 consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later. for patients with no psa decline at week 13, the 
 psa progression date was defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2

 - functional assessment of cancer therapy – prostate 
 the fact-p quality of life questionnaire is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument 
 specifically designed for use in patients with prostate cancer. it consists of 27 core items that assess 
 patient function in 4 domains (fact-g [general] score): physical, social/family, emotional, and 
 functional well-being, followed by a domain of 12 items that assess disease-related symptoms. the 
 sum of scores in all 5 domains constitutes the fact-p. each item is rated on a 0 to 4 likert-type scale, 
 and then combined to produce scores for each domain, as well as a total quality-of-life score with 
 higher scores representing better quality of life. a validated version of the questionnaire was provided 
 to each patient in the local language and completed by the patient on day 1, at weeks 5, 13, and every 
 12 weeks thereafter 
 -</p><p>time to degradation of the functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate 
 the time from randomization to date of degradation of fact-p was evaluated based on completion of 
 the fact-p on day 1, at weeks 5, 13, and every 12 weeks thereafter. degradation on the fact-p was 
 defined as at least a 10-point decrease from baseline in the total score. degradation on individual 
 domains of the fact-p was defined as at least a 3-point decrease from baseline score for that domain. 
 -</p><p>european quality of life 5-domain scale 
 the eq-5d is a standardized instrument that measures health outcome. mobility, self-care, usual 
 activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression are each assessed on a 3-point categorical scale 
 ranging from “no problem” to “extreme problem.” the eq-5d questionnaire was administered by study 
 site staff directly to the patient on day 1, at week 13, and every 12 weeks thereafter. a validated 
 version of the questionnaire was available for use with each patient in the local language 
 -</p><p>brief pain inventory 
 the bpi short form (referred to as bpi throughout this report) is a validated self-administered 
 instrument designed to measure the level of pain and effect of pain on daily activities. the form 
 contains 9 questions and patients were instructed to use the instrument to assess pain related to 
 prostate cancer only. a validated version of the questionnaire was provided to each patient in the local 
 language 
 -</p><p>time to first post-baseline antineoplastic therapy 
 antineoplastic therapies, including cytotoxic, investigational, and hormonal therapies for prostate 
 cancer, were considered for this assessment. time to first post-baseline antineoplastic therapy was 
 defined as time from randomization to date of first use of antineoplastic therapy. such therapies 
 included cytotoxic chemotherapy, noncytotoxic chemotherapy, antiandrogen therapy (ie, bicalutamide, 
 nilutamide, flutamide, and enzalutamide), approved immunotherapy, estrogen, abiraterone, and 
 investigational agents for prostate cancer. the first new post-baseline antineoplastic therapy could

 emergency. in addition, some patients who had disease progression and previously discontinued study

 os 
 the itt population was used for coprimary efficacy evaluations (overall survival and rpfs). the type i 
 error rate of 0.05 was allocated between the 2 coprimary efficacy endpoints: 0.049 (2-sided) for 
 overall survival and 0.001 (2-sided) for rpfs. a prespecified interim analysis of overall survival was 
 planned when approximately 516 deaths (or 67% of the total number of deaths for the final analysis) 
 occurred and was evaluated using a 2-sided type i error rate of 0.012. a 2-stage group sequential 
 design with lan-demets alpha-spending function determined by the o&apos;brien-fleming approach was 
 used to allocate the overall type i error rate, 0.049 (2-sided), between the single interim analysis and 
 the final analysis of overall survival. an unstratified log-rank test was used to compare the 
 enzalutamide and placebo groups for the interim and final analyses of overall survival. the interim 
 analysis of overall survival was prepared by an independent statistical unit, and presented by the 
 independent statistician to the independent dmc during the closed session on 21 oct 2013. 
 during the initial development of the design of this study, os would be looked at using the p = 0.0029 
 level, with around 444 deaths by the interim analysis. the final analysis would be for os at the p = 
 0.048 level, scheduled for when 888 deaths had occurred. nevertheless, based upon the results of the

 cou-aa-302 study with abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naïve patients and the activity of enzalutamide seen in crpc2 (affirm), the target hazard ratio was reduced from 0.83 to 0.815, which 
 reduced the required number of targeted death events from 888 to 765 for a type i error rate of 
 0.049. the number of death events required for the interim analysis of os was increased from 444 to 
 516 (67% of events). 
 rpfs 
 the primary (final) rpfs analysis was conducted at the time of the interim overall survival analysis, 
 when a minimum of 410 centrally confirmed rpfs events occurred. radiographic pfs was compared 
 between the 2 treatment groups using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test. the rpfs analysis was 
 prepared by the independent statistical unit and presented to the dmc at the time of the interim 
 analysis of overall survival. 
 the censoring rules and sensitivity analyses for rpfs are acceptable. 
 secondary endpoints 
 the itt population was used for secondary efficacy evaluations. to maintain a study-wide type i error 
 of 5%, the holm step-down procedure was applied to secondary endpoint analyses.

 1 dose of enzalutamide (871 patients) or placebo (844 patients). a total of 207 study sites in 22 
 countries in north america, europe, australia, and asia randomized patients in this study. the highest 
 enrolling countries were the us (247 patients, 14.4%), australia (232 patients, 13.5%), canada (179 
 patients, 10.4%), france (175 patients, 10.2%), and the united kingdom (153 patients, 8.9%). 
 enrollment by site ranged from 1 to 35 patients. the highest enrolling sites were the institut gustave-

 roussy (france, site 300, 35 patients, 2.0%), memorial sloan-kettering (us, site 001, 32 patients, 1.9%), and the royal marsden hospital (united kingdom, site 650, 29 patients, 1.7%). 
 at weeks 25, 49, and 85 (approximately 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively), the number of patients 
 in the treatment phase in the enzalutamide group was 777 (89.1%), 643 (73.7%), and 287 (32.9%) 
 versus 387 (45.8%), 185 (21.9%), and 48 (5.7%), respectively, for the placebo group. 
 as of the data cut-off date, 246 patients (28.2%) in the enzalutamide group and 313 patients (37.0%) 
 in the placebo group permanently discontinued from the study. the primary reason for discontinuation 
 from the study was death: 540 patients (241 enzalutamide, 27.6% vs 299 placebo, 35.4%). only 19 
 patients (1.1%) withdrew consent for survival follow-up or were lost to survival follow-up prior to 
 death.</p></section><section><header>conduct of the study</header><p>the original study protocol was dated 9 june 2010. the protocol was amended 4 times during the blinded study period. a subsequent amendment added an open-label extension period based on the 
 recommendation of the dmc to halt the study and allow placebo-treated patients access to 
 enzalutamide. 
 major changes to the controlled portion of the study (amendments 1 through 4) are summarized 
 below. 
 amendment 1 (27 aug 2010, prior to first randomization) made the following major changes: 
 -</p><p>replaced the original primary efficacy variables (time to first skeletal-related event and time to 
 initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy) with new primary efficacy variables (overall survival and 
 progression-free survival [pfs]). 
 -</p><p>added that the primary analysis of overall survival was to be performed when 888 deaths were 
 reported. 
 -</p><p>specified that the study would not be discontinued based on the primary analysis of pfs; the 
 study was to continue until the primary analysis of overall survival was complete. 
 amendment 2 (29 mar 2011, after 153 patients were randomized) made the following major changes: 
 -</p><p>clarified that informed consent must be signed, and abdominopelvic ct scan or mri, bone 
 scan, chest x-ray or chest ct must occur within 6 weeks of randomization, otherwise the 
 screening visit had to be repeated. 
 -</p><p>clarified that chest ct should be performed at the time of radiographic assessments if 
 screening scan demonstrated metastatic chest disease. 
 -</p><p>added that determination of radiographic progression had to be confirmed by the independent 
 central radiology review before stopping radiographic imaging. 
 -</p><p>clarified that the bpi was to assess prostate cancer-related pain only. 
 amendment 3 (23 jul 2012, after 1696 patients were randomized) made the following major changes: 
 -</p><p>specified that the primary analysis of rpfs was to be based on the first 410 rpfs events and 
 conducted at the time of the formal interim analysis of overall survival. 
 -</p><p>clarified that the prespecified interim analysis for overall survival was to be performed at 
 approximately 50% of the required total number of death events (444 of 888) for the primary 
 overall survival analysis and not at the end of the enrollment period.

 page 27/92</p><p>
 amendment 4 (14 mar 2013, after all 1717 patients were randomized) made the following major changes: 
 -</p><p>added secondary objectives (time to psa progression, psa response 50%, best overall soft 
 tissue response, and safety of enzalutamide compared to placebo). time to psa progression 
 and safety were formerly other secondary objectives. 
 -</p><p>clarified that rpfs was to be analyzed from randomization to radiographic progression or death 
 within 168 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever was first). 
 -</p><p>clarified that a minimum of the first 410 rpfs events were required for the primary pfs 
 analysis. after the required 410 rpfs events, radiographic progression should be confirmed by 
 the local radiology review before stopping radiographic imaging. 
 -</p><p>changed the assumed target hazard ratio for benefit of enzalutamide over placebo in overall 
 survival from 0.83 to 0.815. the minimum target number of deaths required for the primary 
 analysis of overall survival changed from 888 to 765 due to increased assumed effect size. 
 -</p><p>updated statistical endpoints and methods to be consistent with new objectives and the 
 statistical analysis plan.

 the primary rpfs results were shown to be robust through pre-specified sensitivity analyses evaluating 
 the effect of various censoring rules, such as inclusion of all deaths rather than deaths within 168 days 
 of treatment discontinuation, requirement for soft tissue confirmation before week 13, and other 
 analyses censoring for clinical progression events (hazard ratios ranging from 0.174-0.234, all p &lt; 
 0.0001). in addition, an analysis of rpfs using investigator assessments through the overall survival 
 data cut-off date (16 sep 2013) and including all randomized patients showed consistent findings in 
 favour of enzalutamide treatment (hr = 0.307, 95% ci: 0.267, 0.353, p &lt; 0.0001). in this more 
 mature analysis, the median duration of rpfs was 19.7 months for patients receiving enzalutamide 
 (95% ci: 18.1, 22.3) compared with 5.4 months (95% ci: 4.2, 5.6) for patients receiving placebo.

 table 28: time to degradation of functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (itt population)</p><p>statistically significant results (p ≤ 0.0001) were also demonstrated in time to degradation of each of the 5 individual domains, defined as a decrease in at least 3 points from baseline in the domain. these 
 domains assess physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-
 being, and prostate cancer symptoms (hazard ratio range, 0.664-0.745). 
 • quality of life: summary of the european quality of life 5-domain scale as specified in the statistical analysis plan, no statistical tests were performed on the differences in 
 quality of life as measured by the eq-5d between treatment groups or over time. summary data 
 throughout the study are difficult to interpret given the decreasing number of patients completing the 
 questionnaire over time, especially in the placebo group.</p><p>
 after week 25, the differences in the number of patients completing the assessment between groups is 
 too large to provide meaningful comparisons. overall through week 25, patients treated with 
 enzalutamide had numerically higher quality of life scores across all domains as measured by the eq-
 5d compared with patients treated with placebo 
 • quality of life: pain progression as assessed by the brief pain inventory at baseline, the mean/median pain intensity score was 0.8/0.3 in the enzalutamide group and 0.7/0.0 
 in the placebo group. at month 6, the mean/median pain intensity score was 1.0/0.0 in the 
 enzalutamide group and 1.2/0.5 in the placebo group. at month 6, 31.8% of the enzalutamide group 
 had progression of pain compared with 37.2% of the placebo group. the difference in the rate of pain 
 progression between treatment groups (enzalutamide minus placebo; 5.35%) was not statistically 
 significant based on an unstratified cochran-mantel-haenszel score test (p = 0.082). at month 6, the 
 mean change from baseline for each component of the pain intensity score was numerically less in the 
 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group. however, less than half of the placebo group 
 remained on study and completed a baseline and week 25 bpi assessment (42.4% compared with 
 80.0% of the enzalutamide group) and overall pain intensity scores were generally very low at each 
 assessment (median scores of 0, mean &lt; 2 for each question).

 similarly, pain interference scores evaluating the effect of pain across 7 different daily activities were low in both groups at baseline (median score of 0 at for each domain; mean score of &lt; 1 for each 
 domain); however, the change from baseline in mean pain interference scores at month 6 was 
 numerically less in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group for each of the 7 
 domains. mean pain interference scores, defined as the average of each of the 7 domains, were 
 calculated at baseline and month 6. patients treated with enzalutamide had a lower percentage change 
 from baseline to month 6 in mean pain interference scores. no statistical comparisons were made 
 between treatment groups in evaluating pain interference.</p></section><section><header>ancillary analyses</header></section><section><header>sub-group analyses</header><p>subgroup analyses of overall survival and rpfs were performed to determine if the treatment effect was consistent among subgroups. the same methodology used for overall survival and rpfs

 the most well-established endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic crpc are overall survival and rpfs as assessed in the controlled clinical studies, 
 mdv3100-03 and crpc2. long-term follow-up for overall survival was not performed in any of the 
 open-label studies, and radiographic data from these studies focused primarily on radiographic 
 response rate.</p><p>an additional clinically relevant endpoint only obtained within the controlled studies 
 included time to first skeletal-related event.</p><p>evaluation of quality of life measures varied between the 
 2 controlled studies given the different study populations, although both utilised the fact-p, eq-5d, 
 and bpi.</p><p>best overall soft tissue response was evaluated in mdv3100-03, crpc2, s-3100-1-01, and 
 9785-cl-0111.</p><p>markers of bone turnover were included in s-3100-1-01 and 9785-cl-0111.</p><p>
 circulating tumour cell counts were included in crpc2, s-3100-1-01, and 9785-cl-0111, but data 
 were only available from s-3100-1-01 and 9785-cl-0111. psa response rates were obtained across all 
 studies.</p><p> 
 although initial evidence of efficacy assessed by psa response rate has been demonstrated in patients 
 with hormone-naïve prostate cancer in study [9785-cl-0321], this comparative section will focus on a 
 discussion of the data from studies of patients with metastatic prostate cancer that progressed on 
 androgen deprivation therapy. 
 demographic and baseline characteristics of patients with metastatic crpc enrolled across the studies 
 were generally well matched.</p><p>the major differences between the studies were related to the target 
 study population and to prior treatments for prostate cancer: mdv3100-03, the pivotal study for this 
 application, enrolled only chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc; crpc2 enrolled only 
 patients with metastatic crpc who previously received docetaxel.</p><p>the other presented studies 
 enrolled patients with metastatic crpc without regard to prior chemotherapy.</p><p>other differences 
 among the study populations were primarily related to eligibility for each study (eg, inclusion of only 
 japanese patients in 9785-cl-0111, exclusion of patients with ecog performance status &gt; 1 in 
 mdv3100-03). 
 os 
 overall survival was assessed as a primary endpoint in both controlled studies, and was defined as the 
 time from randomization to death due to any cause.</p><p> 
 enzalutamide treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death compared 
 with placebo treatment in both studies.</p><p>in mdv3100-03, the unstratified hazard ratio was 0.706 (95% 
 ci: 0.596, 0.837; p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>in crpc2, the stratified hazard ratio was 0.631 (95% ci: 0.529, 
 0.752; p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p> 
 in both studies, the survival benefit was observed early, with separation of the kaplan meier curves 3 
 to 4 months after randomization.</p><p>the longer estimated median durations of survival in mdv3100-03 
 compared with crpc2 reflect the earlier stage disease of the mdv3100-03 patient population.</p><p>in 
 mdv3100-03, the estimated medians are considered unstable because of the small number of patients 
 at risk at the times the medians were estimated and shorter duration of follow up for overall survival 
 relative to the estimated medians, both of which contribute to the large variability associated with the 
 medians. 
 rpfs 
 radiographic progression free survival was a coprimary endpoint in mdv3100-03 and a key secondary 
 endpoint in crpc2.</p><p>in mdv3100-03, rpfs was defined as the time from randomization to first 
 objective evidence of radiographic progression or death within 168 days of treatment discontinuation, 
 whereas in crpc2, rpfs was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence 
 of disease progression or death due to any cause.</p><p>both studies utilized pcwg2 and recist 1.1 criteria 
 for determining progression, although in mdv3100-03, radiographic progression was evaluated by

 independent blinded central reviewers and by investigators, whereas in crpc2 radiographic progression was evaluated only by investigators.</p><p>the 2 studies also utilized different censoring rules, 
 although both studies demonstrated that results were robust to sensitivity analyses evaluating the 
 impact of different censoring conventions 
 a final important difference in rpfs evaluations between the 2 studies was in the radiographic 
 assessment schedule.</p><p>in mdv3100-03, on study imaging occurred at weeks 9, 17, 25, and every 12 
 weeks thereafter whereas in crpc2, on study imaging occurred at week 13 and every 12 weeks 
 thereafter.</p><p>this difference allowed for an earlier separation of kaplan meier curves in mdv3100-03 
 compared with crpc2.</p><p>in both studies, enzalutamide treated patients had a statistically significant 
 decreased risk of radiographic progression or death.</p><p>in mdv3100-03, the unstratified hazard ratio was

 47 japanese patients with metastatic crpc, including 43 previously treated with docetaxel and 4 
 chemotherapy-naïve patients. nine patients were in the dose-escalation cohort and 38 patients were in 
 the dose-expansion cohort used for efficacy analyses. after receiving single doses of enzalutamide 80, 
 160, or 240 mg, patients received 80 or 160 mg once daily during a multiple-dose period and 
 subsequently commenced long-term dosing with enzalutamide 160 mg/day. efficacy endpoints 
 included radiographic objective response at day 85, psa response, circulating tumor cells, and markers 
 of bone turnover. radiographic response was evaluated by an independent recist evaluation 
 committee and by the investigator. 
 of the 38 patients in the dose-expansion cohort included in efficacy analyses, the median age was 71.5 
 years (range, 50-85 years) and all were of japanese descent. twenty-five patients (65.8%) entered 
 the study with an ecog performance status of 0 and 13 (34.2%) had an ecog performance status of 
 1. twenty-nine patients (76.3%) had gleason scores at diagnosis of 8 to 10 and median psa at 
 baseline was 65.8 ng/dl. a major difference in this small study population compared with the crpc2 
 study population was that most patients received prior treatment with estramustine in addition to prior 
 treatment with docetaxel and had a greater number of prior hormonal treatments. 
 the radiographic objective response rate (cr or pr) at day 85 was 5.3% as assessed by the 
 independent recist evaluation committee and 7.9% as assessed by the investigator. when evaluating 
 best overall radiographic response rates during long-term dosing, the values were 11.1% by the 
 recist committee and 5.9% by the investigator. radiographic disease control rate (cr, pr, or stable 
 disease) at day 85 was 47.4% as assessed by the recist committee and 50% as assessed by the 
 investigator. best overall radiographic disease control rate during long-term dosing was 66.7% as 
 assessed by the recist committee and 64.7% by the investigator. eleven of 38 patients (28.9%) had 
 a ≥ 50% decrease in psa at the time of nadir; 4 of 38 patients (10.5%) had a ≥ 90% decrease in psa 
 at the time of nadir. 
 of the 38 evaluable patients, 20 patients had favourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline (&lt; 5 
 per 7.5-ml blood), and a total of 26 patients had evaluable baseline and post-baseline circulating 
 tumour cell data. 
 of the 20 patients with favourable circulating tumour counts at baseline, enzalutamide treatment was 
 associated with maintenance of favourable circulating tumour counts in 53.8% of patients. of the 18 
 patients with unfavourable circulating tumour counts at baseline, 9 patients had post-baseline samples.

 progression (psa-soft tissue-bone) were recruited. during the study, all patients continued on a lhrh analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. it has therefore been reflected in section 4.2 of the smpc 
 that medical castration with an lhrh analogue should be continued during treatment of patients not 
 surgically castrated. patients were allowed to receive sipuleucel-t during the study. importantly, 
 concomitant treatment with abiraterone was allowed once patients had either confirmed radiographic 
 progression or a skeletal-related event. bisphosphonates, palliative therapy including radiation therapy 
 and opiate analgesics were also allowed.</p><p>
 the primary objectives of study mdv3100-03 were to determine the benefit of enzalutamide compared

 the benefit of enzalutamide compared with placebo on clinically relevant markers of disease 
 progression and quality of life.</p><p>the objectives of the study are considered acceptable as well as the 
 endpoints proposed in this setting. the frequency and methods for scheduled assessments of the 
 progression disease (intervals; 4 weeks through week 49 and then every 12 weeks thereafter) is 
 considered acceptable and the use of central radiology review is of value, despite the double blind 
 design. the censoring rules proposed are overall acceptable.</p><p>
 the concurrent interim analysis of overall survival and final analysis of rpfs were consistent with prior 
 regulatory advice.

 enzalutamide or placebo across 207 study centres in 22 countries. as of january 2014, placebo treated 
 patients began crossing-over to enzalutamide treatment on an amended mdv3100-03 protocol which 
 could have biased future updates of the data.</p><p>
 the treatment groups were overall well balanced with respect to clinically relevant baseline 
 demographic and disease characteristics. of note, the percentage of patients with visceral disease was 
 11.2% and 12.5% in enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively. 2.5% and 3.0% of patients in each 
 arm did not have disease progression per protocol at study entry. 
 in relation to prior therapy of prostate cancer, about 28 % and 18 % of patients had received 3 and ≥ 
 4 unique prior hormonal therapy. the number of unique prior hormonal therapies does not represent 
 the number of “lines” and were defined as distinct hormonal drug treatments for prostate cancer that 
 were started prior to randomization. 
 more than 50% (53.1%) of patients recruited into the trial were in europe (including israel). the most 
 common reason for discontinuation for both groups was “discontinuation due to disease progression” 
 (enzalutamide group: 40.7% vs placebo group: 68.3%). of them, both radiographic progression and 
 clinical progression were higher for the placebo group (enzalutamide arm: 32.7% and 9.7% vs placebo 
 group: 54.6% and 17.8% respectively). discontinuations due to skeletal-related events were quite 
 similar between arms (5.0% vs 5.4%). 5.6% subjects in the enzalutamide group and 6.0% subjects in 
 the placebo group discontinued treatment due to aes, which could give an overall impression of the 
 tolerability of the drug. 
 the protocol of the study was modified several times, especially the fourth amendment was critical. 
 this one was carried out after knowing the results from the study conducted with abiraterone. this was 
 somehow expectable and the changes introduced will likely not modify the conclusions of the study. 
 the second amendment was introduced after 153 patients were randomised. due to the low number of 
 subjects, a high impact on the results is unlikely.</p><p>

 page 53/92</p></section><section><header>efficacy data and additional analyses</header><p>enzalutamide has shown positive results in all the variables studied. both co-primary endpoints were met. data on os with data cut-off date september 2013 clearly indicated a higher life expectancy for 
 patients treated with enzalutamide (hr 0.706, 95% ci: 0.596, 0.837) even though the estimate in 
 terms of medians was not accurate and could not provide a clear reflection of the benefit for the 
 patients due to the immature nature of the data.</p><p>
 the updated analysis (cut-off january 2014; after four additional months and 116 additional deaths; 
 58 in each group) confirmed the observations from the pre-specified interim analysis (hr 0.730 and 
 hr 0.706 respectively).</p><p>the updated median overall survival was not yet reached in the enzalutamide 
 group and was 31 months in the placebo group. the data are still considered immature (38 %) 
 although an hr of 0.7 suggests a large treatment benefit. as a consequence, the mah should submit 
 an os update together with an update on investigator assessed rpfs no later than september 2015 
 (see annex ii condition).</p><p>
 this outcome in terms of os was supported by the vast majority of the subgroups analysed.</p><p>
 results from the other co-primary endpoint were also positive (rpfs). a total of 118 patients (14.2%) 
 in the enzalutamide group and 321 patients (40.1%) in the placebo group experienced radiographic 
 progression or death within 168 days after study drug discontinuation at the time of the data cut-off 
 date of 6 may 2012 (hr 0.186; 95% ci: 0.149, 0.231). estimated median duration of rpfs was not yet 
 reached in the enzalutamide group (95% ci: 13.8, not yet reached) and 3.9 months in the placebo 
 group (95% ci: 3.7, 5.4) (see section 5.1 of the smpc). as expected for this patient population, the 
 rpfs endpoint comprised mainly radiographic progression events (89% enzalutamide group vs 92% 
 placebo group) rather than death events prior to radiographic progression. in general, soft tissue 
 progression was observed before bone progression which may be due to the fact that soft tissue 
 progression required no confirmatory scan as per the protocol but also that metastatic spread involving 
 soft tissue is associated with a more aggressive nature of the disease. consistent rpfs benefit was 
 observed across all pre-specified patient subgroups (e.g., age, baseline ecog performance, baseline 
 psa and ldh, gleason score at diagnosis, and visceral disease at screening). 
 median follow-up time based on reverse kaplan-meier estimation was 5.4 months for the enzalutamide 
 group versus 3.6 months for the placebo group. the separation of the curves was clearly shown. both 
 the subgroup analyses and the sensitivity analyses carried out pointed out in the same direction.</p><p>
 regarding the use of subsequent therapies there was a higher and earlier use in the placebo group 
 (70.3%) compared with the enzalutamide group (40.3%). while according to the patient disposition a 
 total of 932 patients were considered to have disease progression, a total of 1024 subjects received 
 any post-baseline antineoplastic therapy. this apparent discrepancy is a result of patients in both 
 treatment groups discontinuing treatment for reasons other than disease progression, such as 
 withdrawal of consent, an adverse event or rising prostate-specific antigen (psa), but then requiring 
 subsequent antineoplastic therapies at some point between discontinuation and the data cut-off date.</p><p>only a small proportion (0.8%) of patients randomized to enzalutamide received concomitant 
 treatment with abiraterone, almost 20% received subsequent treatment with abiraterone, and the 
 majority of patients (79.5%) received neither subsequent nor concomitant treatment with abiraterone. 
 the hazard ratio was less favourable for enzalutamide-treated patients who received subsequent 
 treatment with abiraterone (hr 1.23 [95% ci: (0.89, 1.68)]) and for enzalutamide-treated patients 
 who received subsequent treatment with docetaxel (hr 1.47 [95% ci: (1.17, 1.85)]). notwithstanding 
 the inherent bias associated to these analyses, a possible cross-resistance among treatments cannot 
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/607459/2014 
 page 54/92</p><p>
 be totally ruled out. results of ongoing studies may provide further evidence on the sequential use of abiraterone-enzalutamide. “patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
 treated with abiraterone” has been included as missing information in the rmp and a study will collect 
 data on the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in these patients. 
 regarding the secondary endpoints, time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to first skeletal-
 related event, best overall soft tissue response, time to psa progression, and psa response ≥ 50% 
 were in favour of enzalutamide. the median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 28.0 
 months for patients receiving enzalutamide and 10.8 months for patients receiving placebo 
 (hr=0.350, 95% ci: [0.303, 0.403], p&lt;0.0001) (see section 5.1 of the smpc).</p><p>exploratory analyses were in line with the results observed from primary and secondary endpoints. 
 even though data of qol should be cautiously interpreted, overall, they seemed to favour 
 enzalutamide. 
 the apparent imbalance between the two arms with regard to deaths as primary reason for study drug 
 discontinuation with more events in the enzalutamide arm (17 patients) compared to placebo (7 
 patients) may be due to the longer time on study for enzalutamide treated patients compared with 
 placebo-treated patients, as the median time on enzalutamide treatment was 3.6-fold longer than the 
 median time on placebo treatment. 
 comparison between the two phase iii pivotal studies (mdv3100-03 and crpc2) is marked by the 
 different prognosis of patients recruited in each study, making difficult to draw conclusions in terms of 
 consistency. however, regardless of the setting studied in the different studies, it can be concluded 
 that the efficacy of enzalutamide has been shown in the docetaxel naïve subjects as it was shown in 
 patients previously treated with docetaxel. 
 in relation to the supportive studies provided, they can only be deemed exploratory in nature as they 
 refer to a different population.</p></section><section><header n="2.4.4">2.4.4.  
 conclusions on the clinical efficacy</header><p>the efficacy of enzalutamide has been reasonably shown in the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of 
 androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. 
 the chmp considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
 - in order to address the uncertainties regarding long-term efficacy, the mah should submit updated 
 results from the prevail study and more specifically updated os and investigator assessed rpfs data. 
 the mah should present the data based on the latest time point where investigator assessed rpfs data 
 according to the study protocol is available and where data is not significantly affected by cross-over.

 an increased incidence of seizure was not observed in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
 crpc treated with enzalutamide in mdv3100-03 despite the longer duration of exposure and less 
 stringent entry criteria in this study (e.g., no exclusion for concomitant medications that lower the 
 seizure threshold).</p><p>in mdv3100-03, none of the 871 enzalutamide-treated patients had a seizure (or

 one additional seizure was previously reported in a chemotherapy-naïve patient participating in the

 patients of 0.1% (1 of 967 patients) through the data cut-off date of mdv3100-03 or 0.2% (2 of 
 967 patients) including the patient in mdv3100-03 with an event of seizure after the data cut-off date.</p><p>
 for many events of seizure in the integrated safety population, confounding factors were present that 
 could have independently increased the risk of seizure, such as the presence of brain metastases or a 
 history of seizure.</p><p> 
 based on the method described by the mah for calculation of the event-rate per 100 patient-years

 cardiac disorders 
 the overall incidence of adverse events within the cardiac disorders system organ class in 
 mdv3100-03 was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (10.1% 
 vs 7.8%). the incidence of grade 3 or higher cardiac adverse events was higher in the enzalutamide 
 group compared with the placebo group of mdv3100-03 (2.8% vs 2.1%).

 was comparable between groups within the first 90 days of treatment (0.9% vs 0.8%) and 180 days of 
 treatment (1.0% vs 1.3%) and 365 days of treatment (1.7% vs 1.8%).</p><p>additionally, when adjusted

 hypertension 
 hypertension (and related terms in the ‘hypertension’ narrow smq) was initially identified as an 
 adverse drug reaction in crpc2 (7.0% vs 3.3%), and was also observed with higher incidence in the 
 enzalutamide group of mdv3100-03 (13.9% enzalutamide vs 4.7% placebo).</p><p>the incidence of 
 hypertension events in both treatment groups in mdv3100-03 was higher than in both treatment

 groups in crpc2.</p><p>the incidence of hypertension events in the combined open-label studies was 4.7%, leading to an overall incidence of 8.8% in the integrated safety population.</p><p> 
 the overall higher incidence of hypertension in both treatment groups of mdv3100-03 compared with 
 crpc2 may be partly due to the longer patient exposures in that study (100% longer exposure in the 
 enzalutamide group and 50% longer exposure in the placebo group) as well as heightened awareness 
 by patients and investigators.</p><p>in addition, patients in mdv3100-03 had higher blood pressure at study 
 entry (median baseline systolic 137 mm hg; median baseline diastolic 79 mm hg) compared with 
 patients in crpc2 (median baseline systolic 130 mm hg; median baseline diastolic 75 mm hg).</p><p> 
 hypertension was the most common grade 3 or higher event in the enzalutamide group of 
 mdv3100-03 (6.8%), and was higher than the placebo group (2.3%).</p><p>the high incidence of grade 3 
 events may be related in part to the relatively conservative grading scale for hypertension by ctcae 
 (
 ≥ 160 mm hg systolic blood pressure or ≥ 100 mm hg diastolic), which was adhered to closely by investigators.</p><p>in addition, hypertension was the most common comorbid condition in this patient 
 population at study entry (reported in more than 60% of patients in mdv3100-03), with approximately 
 17% of patients entering the study with grade 3 hypertension at baseline (by screening or baseline 
 blood pressure values).</p><p>in crpc2, approximately 50% of patients entered the study with a 
 documented history of hypertension, and 11% of patients entered the study with grade 3 hypertension 
 at baseline (by screening or baseline blood pressure values).</p><p> 
 hypertension events were more common in patients with a history of hypertension; approximately 
 70% of enzalutamide-treated patients with events of hypertension in mdv3100-03 and the combined 
 controlled population had a documented medical history of hypertension, without important differences 
 between treatment groups.</p><p>the incidence of hypertension events was not affected by age at study 
 entry.</p><p>in both mdv3100-03 and crpc2, the maximum mean change from baseline in systolic and 
 diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first few months of enzalutamide treatment and did not worsen 
 with time.</p><p>accordingly, approximately half of all events of hypertension in both studies were reported 
 within the first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>no clear relationship was apparent between the 
 increased incidence of hypertension events and subsequent cardiovascular sequelae or renal 
 impairment in mdv3100-03 or crpc2.</p><p> 
 the mechanism of hypertension associated with enzalutamide treatment is unknown.</p><p>hypertension 
 was also reported in 22% of chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic crpc taking abiraterone in 
 combination with prednisone [ryan et al, 2013], but the mechanism of action of hypertension in these 
 patients is likely related to increased mineralocorticoid production and fluid retention along with the 
 additive effects of corticosteroids.</p><p>enzalutamide treatment is not associated with hypokalemia, fluid 
 overload, or other features of mineralocorticoid excess.</p><p>in general, the hypertension observed with 
 enzalutamide treatment was successfully treated with standard of care measures and rarely required 
 treatment discontinuation or dose modification.</p><p> 
 fatigue 
 fatigue is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer as well as in patients receiving 
 androgen deprivation therapy.</p><p>fatigue was a dose-dependent adverse event observed in the phase 1 
 dose-escalation study s-3100-1-01, and fatigue (with related terms of asthenia, lethargy, and malaise) 
 was reported in a higher percentage of enzalutamide-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in 
 crpc2 (52.3% vs 46.6%).</p><p>the incidence of fatigue-related events was also higher in the 
 enzalutamide group of mdv3100-03 with a greater difference between treatment groups (48.3% 
 vs 35.0%).</p><p>the higher incidence of fatigue-related events was restricted to grade 1 and grade 2 
 events as the incidence of grade 3 events was identical in mdv3100-03 treatment groups (3.0% each 
 group) and crpc2 (9.0% each group).</p><p>in both studies, enzalutamide-treated patients were less likely 
 than placebo-treated patients to discontinue treatment because of fatigue, but were more likely to

 page 66/92</p><p>
 modify dosing because of fatigue.</p><p>in general, enzalutamide-treated patients with fatigue who reduced the dose to 80 mg or 120 mg daily had resolution of fatigue or improvement to a lower grade.</p><p>
 a modest trend was observed with a higher incidence of fatigue and asthenia events with older 
 patients (≥ 75 years at study entry), although this finding may be confounded by other comorbid 
 conditions in older patients.</p><p> 
 when adjusted for length of exposure, event rates per 100 patient-years for fatigue-related events 
 were lower in the enzalutamide groups than placebo groups of mdv3100-03 (44.6 vs 60.9 events per 
 100 patient-years) and crpc2 (78.0 vs 127.5 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p>however, the cumulative 
 incidence of fatigue-related events was consistently higher in the enzalutamide groups compared with 
 the placebo groups of mdv3100-03 and the combined controlled population.</p><p>in summary, grade 1 
 and 2 fatigue appears to be more prominent as an adverse drug reaction in the earlier-stage patient 
 population of mdv3100-03.</p><p>the aetiology of fatigue is difficult to discern as it may also be related to 
 disease progression, progressive weakness associated with androgen deprivation therapy, and 
 concomitant pain medications that are commonly used as the disease advances.</p><p> 
 hot flush 
 hot flush is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy reported in up to 50% to 80% of 
 men with castrate levels of testosterone [grossman &amp; zajac, 2011].</p><p>the exact mechanism of action is 
 not known, although it is believed that a reduction of sex hormone levels causes thermoregulatory 
 instability in the hypothalamus.</p><p>hot flush combined with flushing was among the adverse events with 
 the largest absolute difference between treatment groups in mdv3100-03 (20.0% vs 7.9%).</p><p>nearly all 
 events were grade 1 or grade 2; only 1 enzalutamide-treated patient had a grade 3 event.</p><p>hot flush 
 was also observed at a substantially increased incidence in enzalutamide-treated patients compared 
 with placebo-treated patients in the combined controlled population (20.4% vs 8.7%), but the event 
 did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any patient in either study.</p><p>when adjusted for length of 
 exposure, the event rates per 100 patient-years for hot flush and flushing were higher in the 
 enzalutamide group.</p><p>the aetiology of the increased incidence of hot flush with enzalutamide treatment 
 may result from a more complete inhibition of androgen signalling pathways.</p><p> 
 falls/non-pathological fractures 
 an increased incidence of falls was noted in patients treated with enzalutamide compared with placebo 
 in mdv3100-03 (11.6% vs 5.3%), with both groups having a higher incidence of falls compared with 
 the earlier crpc2 study (4.5% vs 1.3%), likely due to the longer exposure time. in addition, as fall 
 was observed as an adverse drug reaction in crpc2, there was heightened vigilance in querying for 
 and reporting fall events in mdv3100-03.</p><p>most falls were grade 1 or grade 2 in the combined 
 controlled population, and most falls in the enzalutamide group were reported after at least 6 months 
 of treatment.</p><p>the incidence of falls increased with increasing patient age at study entry in the 
 enzalutamide groups, although the same pattern was also observed for falls in the placebo groups of 
 the controlled studies.</p><p>the aetiology of the increased risk of falls is unknown, but may be 
 multifactorial with possible contributing factors such as weakness associated with androgen 
 deprivation, other concurrent adverse events, and concomitant medication use.</p><p>the events of fall 
 were not associated with an increased incidence of loss of consciousness or subdural hematoma.</p><p>
 where additional descriptive information was available from verbatim terms, falls were most often 
 categorized as mechanical/accidental falls.</p><p> 
 the increased incidence of falls in enzalutamide-treated patients appears to be associated with an 
 increased incidence and tendency toward non-pathological fractures in both mdv3100-03 (7.8% 
 vs 3.0%) and crpc2 (4.1% vs 0.8%).</p><p>similar to events of fall, the majority of non-pathological 
 fractures were reported after 6 months of treatment, which may explain the higher incidence in 
 mdv3100-03 compared with crpc2.</p><p>when evaluating the correlation between falls and non-
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/607459/2014 
 page 67/92</p><p>
 pathological fractures, it was determined that approximately 50% of patients with a non-pathological fracture experienced a fall within the preceding 14 days in mdv3100-03.</p><p>both falls and non-
 pathological fractures were rarely associated with discontinuation of treatment or dose modification in 
 either treatment group of either study.</p><p>when adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate per 
 100 patient-years of falls and non-pathological fractures were higher in the enzalutamide groups of 
 mdv3100-03, crpc2, and the combined controlled population.</p><p>the higher risk of fracture associated 
 with fall in the enzalutamide groups may be related to longer exposure.</p><p> 
 mental impairment 
 the incidence of cognitive and memory impairment-related adverse events under the medical 
 dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra) high-level group term of mental impairment disorders 
 was higher in the enzalutamide group of mdv3100-03 than crpc2 (5.7% vs 1.5%), and the incidence 
 was similar to that observed in crpc2 (4.3% vs 1.8%) despite the longer exposure time in 
 mdv3100-03.</p><p>in the combined controlled population, nearly all events were grade 1 or 2 in severity 
 (5.0% vs 1.6%); only 2 patients in each treatment group experienced grade 3 events (≤ 0.2%).</p><p>no 
 enzalutamide-treated patient in the combined controlled population experienced a serious adverse 
 event involving mental impairment compared with 2 placebo-treated patients in mdv3100-03.</p><p>events 
 involving mental impairment rarely led to discontinuation or modification of dosing, with no differences 
 between treatment groups.</p><p>when adjusted for length of exposure, event rates per 100 patient-years 
 for mental impairment were higher in the enzalutamide groups than the placebo groups of 
 mdv3100-03, crpc2, and the combined controlled population.</p><p>there was no evidence of an increase 
 in road traffic accidents or other serious injuries resulting from mental impairment events in either 
 treatment group of the combined controlled population.</p><p>the etiology of these cognitive changes is 
 unknown, although memory impairment and cognitive changes have also been observed with other 
 drugs that inhibit the androgen signaling pathway [nelson et al, 2008].</p><p> 
 neutropenia 
 the overall incidence of neutropenia or related adverse event terms was infrequent but slightly higher 
 in the enzalutamide group of mdv3100-03 (1.5% enzalutamide vs 0.6% placebo).</p><p>based on central 
 laboratory values, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was similar between treatment groups 
 (0.9% vs 0.7%).</p><p>an increased incidence of neutropenia was previously observed in the earlier crpc2 
 study when assessed by grade 3 or 4 central laboratory values (1.1% vs 0%), but not by adverse 
 event terms (1.4% vs 1.3%).</p><p>in both studies, mean neutrophil counts were below baseline at 
 postbaseline time points in the enzalutamide groups, but the maximum decrease was smaller and 
 occurred later in mdv3100-03 (maximum mean decrease of approximately 560 cells/µl at week 97) 
 compared with crpc2 (maximum mean decrease of approximately 680 cells/µl at week 5) during the 
 relevant study periods.</p><p>only 1 enzalutamide-treated patient experienced a serious adverse event of 
 neutropenia in the combined controlled population (&lt; 0.1%).</p><p>in general, events of neutropenia were 
 transient, did not require treatment discontinuation or dose modification, and were not related to an 
 increased risk of infection in either treatment group.</p><p>enzalutamide was not associated with changes in 
 red blood cells, platelets, or other white blood cells.</p><p>the mechanism for neutropenia associated with 
 enzalutamide treatment is not known.</p><p> 
 headache 
 headache is a common adverse event in clinical studies, in patients with advanced cancer, and in 
 patients receiving androgen deprivation therapies and was assessed as an adverse drug reaction for 
 enzalutamide.</p><p>the incidence of headache was 2-fold higher in enzalutamide-treated patients 
 compared with placebo-treated patients in crpc2 (12.1% vs 5.5%); however, the difference in 
 incidence of headaches was smaller in mdv3100-03 (10.4% vs 7.0%), and the incidence was lower in 
 the combined open-label population (7.7%). in the combined controlled population, most events were

 grade 1 or 2; ≤ 0.5% of patients experienced grade 3 events of headache, with no clear difference between treatment groups.</p><p>headache events were generally reported early, with over half of all 
 events reported within the first 90 days of treatment.</p><p>when adjusted for length of exposure, the event 
 rate for headache was lower in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group of 
 mdv3100-03 (9.9 vs 12.4 events per 100 patient-years) but higher in the enzalutamide group of 
 crpc2 (16.6 vs 14.1 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p>the etiology for the increased incidence in the 
 more advanced patients of crpc2 compared with mdv3100-03 is not known; potential reasons may 
 include increased use of concomitant medications associated with headache such as opiates or 
 manifestations of disease progression (e.g., skull metastases) that are more common in patients with 
 later-stage disease.</p><p> 
 anxiety 
 anxiety was assessed as an adverse drug reaction in the original marketing application as a result of a 
 higher incidence in the enzalutamide group of crpc2 (6.4% vs 4.0%) as well as a pattern of dose 
 dependence in open-label studies.</p><p>in mdv3100-03, the overall incidence of anxiety and the difference 
 in incidence between treatment groups was lower (3.8% vs 2.6%), despite the longer exposure 
 duration.</p><p>although an increased incidence of anxiety in the enzalutamide group was observed within 
 the first 90 and 180 days of crpc2 (4.5% vs 3.3% within the first 90 days and 5.4% vs 3.3% within 
 the first 180 days), a lower incidence of anxiety was observed within the first 90 and 180 days of 
 mdv3100-03 (0.8% vs 1.4% within the first 90 days, 1.8% vs 2.1% in the within the first 180 days).</p><p>
 in mdv3100-03, no enzalutamide-treated patient had a grade 3 or higher event or an event leading to 
 treatment discontinuation or dose modification.</p><p>when adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate 
 was lower in the enzalutamide group in mdv3100-03 (2.9 vs 4.1 events per 100 patient-years) and in 
 crpc2 (8.0 vs 9.4 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p>the etiology of the increased incidence of anxiety 
 associated with enzalutamide treatment is unknown.</p><p> 
 hallucination 
 hallucination was identified as an adverse drug reaction in crpc2 after a finding of increased incidence 
 in the enzalutamide group (1.6% vs 0.3%), and were primarily events of visual hallucination.</p><p>in 
 crpc2, nearly all patients were receiving concomitant opiate medications at the time of the 
 hallucination event.</p><p>the incidence of hallucination events was 0.9% in the combined open-label 
 studies, which are also largely composed of patients who previously received docetaxel.</p><p>an increased 
 incidence of hallucination was not observed in mdv3100-03.</p><p>one patient in each treatment group 
 (0.1%) experienced an event of hallucination, and similar to crpc2, both patients were receiving 
 concomitant opiate medications at the time of the event.</p><p>a total of 23 patients (0.9%) in the 
 integrated safety population experienced events of hallucination, of whom only 1 enzalutamide-treated 
 patient in crpc2 experienced a grade 3 event.</p><p>the aetiology of hallucination in patients with 
 advanced crpc is not known, but use of opiate-containing medications appears to be a confounding 
 factor.</p><p> 
 dry skin/pruritus 
 events of dry skin and pruritus were considered adverse drug reactions in crpc2 as a result of higher 
 incidences in the enzalutamide group (3.5% vs 1.3% for dry skin, 3.8% vs 1.3% for pruritus) along 
 with higher event rates when adjusted for length of exposure.</p><p>in addition, both of these events have 
 been described with other antiandrogen treatments [bicalutamide prescribing information; nilutamide 
 prescribing information].</p><p>in mdv3100-03, the overall incidences of these events were lower than in 
 crpc2 for both groups, and although the incidences were higher in the enzalutamide group than the 
 placebo group, the differences between groups were smaller (&lt; 1%) and not considered clinically 
 relevant.</p><p>additionally, in mdv3100-03, the event rate per 100 patient-years for each of these events 
 was lower in the enzalutamide group when adjusted for length of exposure.</p><p>

 gynecomastia an increased incidence of gynecomastia was observed in the enzalutamide group of mdv3100-03 
 (3.3% enzalutamide vs 1.3% placebo), although when adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate 
 was only marginally higher in the enzalutamide group (2.5 vs 2.0 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p>an 
 increased incidence of gynecomastia was also observed in crpc2 (2.5% vs 1.0%), although the

 enzalutamide-treated patients occurred in the first 90 days of treatment in both the combined 
 controlled population and the integrated safety population.</p><p>all events of gynecomastia in the 
 combined controlled population were grade 1 or 2 in severity, except 1 enzalutamide-treated patient in 
 crpc2 had grade 3 gynecomastia.</p><p>gynecomastia did not lead to treatment discontinuation or dose 
 modification in any patient in the integrated safety population.</p><p>in the phase 2 study of enzalutamide 
 monotherapy in hormone-naïve patients with prostate cancer, the incidence of gynecomastia was 
 nearly 50%.</p><p>the etiology of gynecomastia associated with enzalutamide treatment is likely related to 
 its primary pharmacology of androgen receptor inhibition and has also been reported with other 
 antiandrogens [bicalutamide prescribing information].</p><p>given the consistent increase in incidence in 
 enzalutamide-treated patients across studies as well as the pharmacologic basis, gynecomastia is 
 considered an adverse drug reaction.</p><p> 
 restless legs syndrome 
 restless legs syndrome was reported in a higher proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients in 
 mdv3100-03 (2.1% vs 0.4%) and crpc2 (1.5% vs 0.3%).</p><p>in the integrated safety population, the 
 incidence was 1.8%.</p><p>nearly all events in the integrated safety population were grade 1 or grade 2;

 legs syndrome was reported as a medical history event in 1.3% of mdv3100-03 patients and 1.1% of 
 crpc2 patients, although this may be an underestimate as the overall prevalence in north america

 enzalutamide is unknown.</p><p>other medications such as centrally acting antihistamines, serotonergic 
 antidepressants, and dopamine-blocking antiemetics have been linked to initiation or worsening of 
 restless legs syndrome, but it has not been consistently reported with antiandrogens.</p><p>although the 
 incidence is low across studies, given the consistency of findings and the occurrence within the first 
 90 days of treatment, restless legs syndrome is considered an adverse drug reaction. 
 neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified 
 a higher incidence of events of second malignancy, including non-melanoma skin cancer, was observed 
 in the mdv3100-03 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (3.9% vs 1.1%; 
 3.1 vs 0.7% excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer).</p><p>a smaller imbalance was observed in crpc2 (1.0%

 (3.3 vs 1.8 events per 100 patient-years for any second malignancy, and 2.0 vs 0.7 events per 
 100 patient-years for any grade 3 or higher second malignancy).</p><p>in crpc2, the event rates were 
 comparable or lower in the enzalutamide group relative to placebo (1.2 vs 1.2 events per 
 100 patient-years for any second malignancy, and 0.6 vs 1.2 events per 100 patient-years for any 
 grade 3 or higher second malignancy). there was no overall pattern by anatomic location or cell type 
 for the other events of second malignancy observed in enzalutamide-treated patients

 (0.6%) experienced 50 adverse events of second malignancy.</p><p>in order to provide context for the limited size of the integrated studies database, the observed incidence of second malignancy 
 (excluding non-melanoma skins cancer) in the enzalutamide integrated safety population was 
 compared with the expected overall incidence of malignancy, and the incidence of each type of 
 malignancy, using cancer statistics data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) 
 program database (
 www.seer.cancer.gov
 ). the overall incidence of second malignancy in the 
 40 enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated safety population is within the expected incidence 
 for all cancer sites combined per seer-18 (64 events expected in a population ≥ 65 years).</p><p>further, 
 there was no overall pattern of higher than expected incidence by anatomic location or cell type, with 
 some malignancies occurring at higher than expected frequency in the seer data (e.g., tonsil, gastric) 
 and others at lower than expected frequency (e.g., lung). 
 a review of postmarketing adverse events of xtandi (enzalutamide) capsules (data collected through 
 31 oct 2013) did not identify a safety signal in the neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified 
 system organ class.</p><p>in the postmarketing data, events considered unrelated to prostate cancer include 
 6 patients with hematologic malignancy (2 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 patient each 
 with chronic myeloid leukaemia, unspecified hematologic malignancy, leukaemia, and lymphoma), and 
 1 patient each with bladder cancer, colon cancer, small cell lung cancer metastatic, testis cancer, and 
 cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p>events considered likely to be associated with underlying prostate cancer 
 included malignant neoplasm (unspecified, 4 patients), bone cancer (3 patients), and lymphangiosis 
 carcinomatosa (1 patient).</p><p>a causal relationship with enzalutamide could not be established due to the 
 limited clinical information available through spontaneous reporting.</p><p> 
 although no carcinogenicity studies have been performed with enzalutamide (per ich s9), nonclinical 
 studies have not revealed evidence of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, or mutagenicity..</p><p> 
 based on the overall incidence rate of second malignancy consistent with the seer-18 data, second 
 malignancies observed across different organ systems and cell types, median onset latency of second 
 malignancies of 199 days (a relatively short latency) in enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated 
 safety population, and evidence of pre-existing malignancy in some patients at study entry, a causal 
 relationship between enzalutamide treatment and second malignancy is unlikely.</p></section><section><header>serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</header><p>deaths overall, deaths from prostate cancer disease progression, deaths from other causes (unrelated to 
 prostate cancer disease progression) and deaths from unknown (or unspecified) causes were all lower 
 in the enzalutamide group than the placebo group.</p><p>two patients (1 in the enzalutamide group and 1 in 
 the placebo group) died within 30 days of initiation of study drug.</p><p>the enzalutamide-treated patient 
 died of unknown causes at home, the placebo-treated patient died of an acute subdural hematoma 
 associated with a fall.</p><p> 
 deaths within 30 days of discontinuation of study drug were higher in the enzalutamide group 
 compared with the placebo group (4.0% vs 3.4%), with the small overall difference resulting from 
 deaths due to other causes (unrelated to prostate cancer) and unknown (or unspecified) causes.</p><p>the 
 proportion of patients with deaths due to prostate cancer was similar between treatment groups.</p><p>most 
 deaths within 30 days of discontinuation of study drug are within the treatment-emergent period and 
 are also reported as adverse events leading to death, although 5 deaths (2 in the enzalutamide group 
 and 3 in the placebo group) were after the reporting period (e.g., patients who discontinued study 
 drug and immediately initiated cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to death).

 of the 37 deaths reported during the treatment-emergent period in the enzalutamide group, investigators assessed on the end of study crf that 17 patients had death due to disease progression, 
 16 patients had death due to causes other than disease progression, and 4 had death due to unknown 
 (or unspecified) causes.</p><p>of the 32 deaths reported during the treatment-emergent period in the 
 placebo group, investigators assessed that 18 patients had causes of death assessed as due to disease 
 progression, 13 as due to causes other than disease progression, and 1 due to unknown causes. a 
 slightly higher incidence of treatment-emergent deaths was due to causes unrelated to prostate cancer 
 in the enzalutamide group (18 patients, 2.1%) compared with the placebo group (13 patients, 1.5%) 
 of these, a total of 9 enzalutamide-treated patients (1.0%) and 5 placebo-treated patients (0.6%) died 
 of cardiovascular-related causes during the treatment-emergent period; most of these patients had 
 multiple cardiac risk factors.</p><p>of note, only 1 patient in each treatment group had an adverse event of 
 hypertension prior to a cardiovascular-related death.</p><p> 
 a review of sudden or unexpected deaths due to unknown causes reported with different preferred 
 terms under different system organ classes did not reveal any safety finding associated with 
 enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>review of the narratives for all patients with adverse events leading to death 
 revealed 16 patients with sudden and/or unexpected deaths:</p><p>10 patients (1.1%) in the enzalutamide 
 group and 6 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group.</p><p>nearly all of these patients had significant cardiac 
 risk factors at baseline, and patients in both treatment groups had occasional episodes of increased 
 blood pressure and/or prolonged qtcf interval with no clear difference between treatment groups.</p><p>
 when adjusted for exposure duration, the event rates of sudden or unexpected death were lower in the 
 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (0.8 vs 1.1 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p> 
 deaths from accidents or acute injuries during the treatment-emergent period included 1 patient in the 
 enzalutamide group (accidental drowning) and 2 patients in the placebo group (road traffic accident 
 and subdural hematoma).</p><p>one patient in each treatment group died of a second malignancy during 
 the treatment-emergent period (1 enzalutamide-treated patient died of rectal cancer diagnosed on 
 study day 8 and 1 placebo-treated patient died of lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed on study day 58). 
 one patient in each treatment group died of infectious causes during the treatment-emergent period.</p></section><section><header>serious aes</header><p>patients treated with enzalutamide in mdv3100-03 had a higher overall incidence of serious adverse events than patients treated with placebo (32.0% vs 26.8%); however, the difference between groups 
 is primarily due to the longer duration of exposure in the enzalutamide group.</p><p>when serious adverse 
 events are compared by treatment group within the first 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days of 
 treatment, the incidences of these events was lower in the enzalutamide group.</p><p>the imbalance toward 
 a higher incidence in the enzalutamide group is observed only after 1 year of treatment, when 
 67.8% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 18.0% of patients in the placebo group remained on 
 study drug treatment.</p><p>similarly, the median time to the first serious adverse event is longer in the 
 enzalutamide group than the placebo group (not yet reached vs 23.3 months).</p><p>

 system organ class with a higher proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients within the first 180 days 
 of treatment (0.5% each group within 90 days; 1.0% enzalutamide vs 0.7% placebo within 180 days). 
 no serious adverse event terms were reported with at least a 1% higher absolute incidence in the 
 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group.</p><p>hydronephrosis was the only serious adverse

 discussion on clinical safety</header><p>the safety database of enzalutamide encompasses 2509 patients treated with enzalutamide plus standard of care. of them, 967 patients (38.5%) did not receive prior docetaxel and therefore are 
 considered the target population for this application of new indication. within the main study 
 (mdv3100-03, prevail) the median treatment duration for the enzalutamide group was 16.6 months 
 compared with 4.6 months for the placebo group, which intuitively foresee a higher incidence of aes.</p><p>
 overall, the treatment with enzalutamide was well tolerated, since the dose reductions, interruptions 
 and discontinuations were similar or slightly higher for enzalutamide. 
 regarding common aes, the incidence of aes in the mdv3100-03 study was high in both groups. more 
 than 90% of patients had some aes. fatigue, back pain, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, 
 diarrhoea, hot flush, asthenia, weight decreased, peripheral oedema, hypertension, headache, fall, 
 dizziness, haematuria, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, dysgeusia, and upper respiratory tract infection 
 were the most reported aes for enzalutamide when compared to placebo (aes reported in at least 5% 
 of patients in either treatment group with at least a 2% absolute increased incidence in the 
 enzalutamide vs placebo). 
 when the aes reported were adjusted for length of exposure, hot flush, hypertension, fall, and 
 dysgeusia, were higher for patients treated with enzalutamide. hypertension, fall, hot flush, dysgeusia, 
 and upper respiratory tract infection were approximately twice more frequently reported in the 
 enzalutamide arm. according to the investigators, diarrhoea, constipation, fatigue, asthenia, peripheral 
 oedema, dysgeusia, headache, hot flush, and hypertension were probably related to the study drug. 
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/607459/2014 
 page 83/92</p><p>the term gynaecomastia was not presented in the summary table provided by the mah with 5% frequency cut-off. however, according to the source data the frequencies were 3.3% vs. 1.3% in the 
 enzalutamide arm vs. placebo arm in study mdv3100-3, it has therefore been included in the section 
 4.8 of the smpc under frequency “common”. 
 grade 3 or higher aes more frequently reported in the enzalutamide arm versus placebo were cataract 
 (1.3% vs 0.1%) nausea (1.0% vs 0.5%) general physical health deterioration (2.1% vs 1.2%) 
 pneumonia (1.3% vs 0.8%) fall (1.4% vs 0.7%) spinal cord compression (3.8% vs 2.8%) syncope 
 (1.6% vs 0.9%) and hypertension (6.8% vs 2.3%). however, only hypertension and cataract remained 
 higher in the enzalutamide arm after adjusting for the longer safety reporting period. 
 fatigue, hot flush, hypertension, fall, mental impairment, neutropenia, hallucinations, seizure, fatal 
 infections, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity and cardiac disorders were considered aes of special interest in 
 the pre-docetaxel setting. of them, hallucinations, seizure, fatal infections, hepatotoxicity and renal 
 toxicity were not considered associated with the treatment of enzalutamide. fatigue, hot flush, 
 hypertension, fall, mental impairment, neutropenia and cardiac disorders had a higher rate of incidence 
 in the patients treated with enzalutamide. hypertension was clearly associated to enzalutamide, being 
 the most reported aes grade 3-4 (6.8%). the incidence of falls was numerically higher for the 
 enzalutamide group (11.6% vs 5.3%). however, it was evenly balanced within the 180 days of 
 treatment. this ae could be associated to non-pathological fractures (7.8% enzalutamide vs 3.0% 
 placebo) or even seizures. cardiac disorders, despite the higher incidence in aes (10.1% enzalutamide 
 vs 7.8% placebo) and grade 3-4 (2.8% vs 2.1%) were lower in the enzalutamide group when adjusted 
 for length of exposure. 
 with regard to the important identified risk of hallucination, no difference between arms was observed 
 in mdv3100-3. an event of hallucination was reported for 1 patient in each treatment group (0.1%). in 
 crpc2 the incidence was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (1.6% 
 vs. 0.3%). the event rate /100 py in the enzalutamide arm was higher in crpc2 (2.2) and the pooled 
 uncontrolled studies (1.6) was higher than that in mdv3100-3 (&lt;0.1), despite a longer reporting time 
 in the last one. the reason for this difference between studies is not known. the mah argues that most 
 patients with hallucinations were receiving concomitant opiate pain medications. on the basis of the 
 data from mdv3100-3, the prac and chmp consider that hallucinations can be removed from the list 
 of the safety concerns in the rmp.</p><p>
 of note, there was an increased occurrence of cataract in the enzalutamide arm compared with 
 placebo in mdv3100-3. it is possible that increasing age and other risk factors increase the risk of 
 cataract over time, thereby contributing to a higher time-adjusted rate in the enzalutamide-treated 
 arm due to the 3 times longer observation time in this arm. it is also agreed that the time-to-onset is 
 low (&lt; 1 year) for most cases, suggesting other causative factors, and for the longer time spans only 
 data from the enzalutamide arm is available. it was therefore not included in the smpc.</p><p>
 cognitive/memory impairment was proposed to be upgraded from important potential risk to important 
 identified risk in the rmp by the mah which is endorsed. in mdv3100-3, the rate of the meddra hlgt 
 term of mental impairment disorders was 4.5 vs. 2.8 events/ 100 patient-years in the enzalutamide vs. 
 placebo arm. however, due to the low frequencies, the size of the respective problems from a clinical 
 perspective appears relatively small. 
 in the phase 3 clinical studies, 7 patients (0.4%) experienced a seizure out of 1671 patients treated 
 with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas one patient (&lt;0.1%) receiving placebo 
 experienced a seizure. dose appears to be an important predictor of the risk of seizure, as reflected by 
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>
 ema/chmp/607459/2014 
 page 84/92</p><p>
 preclinical data, and data from a dose escalation study. in both phase 3 studies, patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded. 
 as discussed in the assessment of the initial maa, enzalutamide penetrates the blood brain barrier and 
 has been associated with a potential for seizure in preclinical studies, possibly through binding to the 
 gaba receptor. in the clinical setting, seizure was a dlt in the dose-finding study and pk data support 
 the relation to dose. in the registration study crpc2, a higher frequency of seizure was observed than 
 placebo (0.8 vs. 0%, 6 vs. 0 patients). in the present pivotal study mdv3100-03, the incidence was 
 lower and was the same in both treatment arms, (0.1 vs. 0.1%, 1 vs. 1 patient). the three-fold longer 
 observation time in the enzalutamide arm compared to the placebo arm in study crpc2, as well as in 
 study mdv3100-03, should be kept in mind. in that perspective, the difference in seizure events 
 between treatment groups in the combined controlled population (ccp; 0.4 vs. 0.1 %) might not be of 
 concern.</p><p>
 considering the event-rate per 100 patient-years (py) calculated for convulsions smq events, it is 
 noted that an increased event rate persists compared with placebo in the combined phase-3 population 
 (but not in mdv3100-03 alone), although the small numbers make the estimates uncertain (e.g. if only 
 one more patient in the placebo group had a seizure, the event rate would be 2.8/1000= py, similar to 
 the rate in the active arm.) taken together, the size of the clinical problem of seizures appears small, 
 including the added information from mdv3100-03.</p><p>
 with regard to the eligibility criteria of mdv3100-03 versus crpc2, the relevant difference in exclusion 
 criteria concerned concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. however, the actual use 
 of concomitant medications lowering the seizure threshold (that were not allowed in study crpc2) was 
 comparable in both studies as well as between study arms within each study. as a consequence, the 
 difference in seizure between the two studies cannot be explained by the difference in the frequency of 
 use of these drugs. 
 in conclusion, no explanation for the lower incidence of convulsions/seizure in the present mdv3100-
 03 compared with previous studies have been presented by the mah. in the absence of other 
 explanations, it is conceivable that this phenomenon could be due to a better identification of study 
 participants at risk for seizure at screening. overall, given the pre-clinical background, the presence of 
 a potential mechanism and a dose-response relationship, and the overrepresentation in clinical other 
 studies, seizure is still considered an important identified risk.</p><p>
 falls are confirmed as a common adr in mdv3100-03.the incidence of falls was numerically higher for 
 the enzalutamide group (11.6% vs 5.3%). however, it was evenly balanced within the 180 days of 
 treatment. the review of the clinical documentation associated to falls did not show any relationship 
 between these events and seizures. despite the higher aes of falls in the enzalutamide group (11.6% 
 vs 5.3%) there does not seem to be a clear association with seizures. 
 although the incidence is low across studies, given the consistency of findings and the occurrence 
 within the first 90 days of treatment, restless legs syndrome is considered an adverse drug reaction 
 and included in section 4.8 of the smpc. 
 adverse events resulting in death occurred in 37 patients (4.2%) in the enzalutamide group and 32 
 patients (3.8%) in the placebo group. cardiac disorders was reported as ae leading to death in 7 
 patients (0.8%) in the enzalutamide group vs 3 patients (0.4%) in the placebo group. 10 patients 
 (1.1%) in the enzalutamide group and 6 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group experienced sudden or 
 unexpected deaths, mostly due to cardiac or presumed cardiac causes during the study. according to 
 the mah, nearly all patients with a sudden death event had clinically significant cardiac risk factors at 
 baseline. within the profile of serious aes in a higher frequency for enzalutamide group, coronary 
 xtandi assessment report</p><p>

 page 85/92</p><p>
 artery disease was one of them (0.5% vs 0%). once the cardiovascular adverse events have been adjusted for exposure duration, the risk is considered less of concern. 
 the fact that study mdv3100-03 allowed patients at higher cardiovascular risk as determined by less 
 stringent blood pressure entry criteria, patients with a history of arrhythmias requiring treatment, and 
 patients with a history of moderate (new york heart association [nyha] class ii) heart failure could 
 have influenced these findings. 
 a higher incidence of events of secondary malignancy, including non-melanoma skin cancer, was 
 observed in the mdv3100-03 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (3.9% vs 1.1%; 
 3.1 vs 0.7% excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. the time-adjusted event rate for secondary 
 malignancy was also increased in the enzalutamide arm of mdv3100-3 compared to the placebo arm 
 (3.3 vs. 1.8 events/ 100 py) the difference in frequency of second malignancy between study arms in 
 mdv3100-3 which persists in time-adjusted analysis is not explained. the numbers are small however, 
 and chance findings cannot be ruled out. no difference in the rate of secondary malignancies across 
 study arms was seen in time-adjusted analyses of study crpc2 (1.2 vs. 1.2 events/ 100 py). 
 frequencies and cancer types in the enzalutamide arm in mdv3100-3 are overall within expected 
 population-based frequencies. given the relatively short time to onset, it is not likely that the observed 
 cases represent a cancer-
 inducing effect of enzalutamide. furthermore, as an anti-androgen, there is no obvious mechanism for a theoretical cancer-
 promoting effect of enzalutamide, as androgens normally promote growth. in addition, it could be hypothesised that the risk of secondary malignancies 
 is not constant over time and that the higher rates of secondary malignancy, also in time-adjusted 
 analyses, might partly be caused by other risk factors (age, radiotherapy) acting on the prolonged 
 observation time in the enzalutamide arm. secondary malignancies will continue to be closely 
 monitored in psurs and specifically addressed in the already planned updates from mdv3100-3 to the 
 chmp. 
 a total of 241 enzalutamide-treated patients (27.6%) and 299 placebo-treated patients (35.4%) died 
 as of the data cut-off date. the vast majority were due to disease progression (21.0% of 
 enzalutamide-treated patients and 26.9% of placebo-treated patients). on the contrary, a higher 
 percentage of patients in the enzalutamide arm died within 30 days after discontinuation of study drug 
 in comparison to placebo (4.0% vs 3.4%). 
 regarding the serious aes, a higher percentage of patients in the enzalutamide group had serious aes 
 than in placebo group (32.0% vs 26.8%). nevertheless, it seems that this higher percentage is due to 
 events occurring after 1 year of treatment. serious aes reported in a higher frequency in the 
 enzalutamide group included anaemia (1.6% enzalutamide vs 0.9% placebo), coronary artery disease 
 (0.5% vs 0%), fatigue (0.5% vs 0%), femoral neck fracture (0.6% vs 0%), pathological fracture 
 (1.1% vs 0.6%), cauda equina syndrome (0.5% vs 0%), syncope (0.7% vs 0%), and hypertension 
 (0.5% vs 0%). 
 no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older patients and younger 
 patients. 
 higher frequencies were observed in the enzalutamide arm compared to the placebo arm in study 
 mdv3100-03 with regard to concomitant medication with anti-bacterials for systemic use (7.0% 
 difference), anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products (5.6% difference), anti-anaemic 
 preparations (5.2% difference), and analgesics (4.5% difference). the differences might be 
 attributable to the considerably longer observation time in the enzalutamide arm.</p><p>

 no full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to xtandi 40 mg soft capsules. the mah has submitted a 
 bridging report justifying that no major changes have been made to the leaflet as a consequence of the 
 new indication. there were no significant differences in the content of the daughter leaflet (i.e. 2014) 
 compared to the parent one (i.e. 2012). in addition the key messages as well as the writing style and 
 layout are the same. the justification is considered acceptable and thus a separate user test is not 
 considered required.</p></section><section><header n="3">3.  
 benefit-risk balance</header></section><section><header>benefits beneficial effects</header><p>the administration of enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy setting resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit on both overall survival and rpfs (co-primary endpoints) as 
 demonstrated by a 29% decrease in the risk of death for patients receiving enzalutamide compared 
 with patients receiving placebo (hr 0.706 [95% ci: 0.596, 0.837]) and a 81% decrease in the risk of 
 radiographic progression or death for patients receiving enzalutamide compared with patients receiving 
 placebo (hr 0.186 [95% ci: 0.149, 0.231]). 
 the updated analysis (cut-off january 2014; after four additional months and 116 additional deaths; 
 58 in each group) confirmed the observations from the pre-specified interim analysis (hr 0.730 and 
 hr 0.706 respectively). 
 to ascertain that the benefit by enzalutamide on os was not influenced by post-baseline therapies, an 
 analysis on subsequent treatments were conducted. in the placebo arm 76 % subjects received any 
 post-baseline anti-neoplastic treatment compared to 44 % in the enzalutamide arm. thus, it may be 
 concluded that the os benefit observed is attributable to enzalutamide. 
 secondary endpoints also showed positive results for enzalutamide: time to first skeletal-related event 
 (hr 0.718 [95% ci: 0.610, 0.844]); time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (hr 0.349 [95% ci: 
 0.303, 0.403]); time to psa progression (hr 0.169 [95% ci: 0.147, 0.195]); psa response rate 
 ≥ 50% (between-group difference of 74.5% [95% ci: 71.45-77.57%]; best overall soft tissue response (between-group difference of 53.9% [95% ci: 48.53-59.17%]). 
 results from the co-primary endpoints were robust, showing positive outcomes in all the sensitivity 
 analyses and in the vast majority of subgroups.</p></section><section><header>uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</header><p>the study was stopped after an interim analysis on os, allowing placebo treated patients to receive enzalutamide treatment. this fact will impact on more mature os data. in fact, some of the estimates 
 commonly used when it comes to describing the effect (i.e. median) have not been reached yet. in 
 addition, the medians of the os for both groups of treatment seem quite similar, which very likely is 
 due to the immature data. an update of investigator assessed rpfs together with an os update will be 
 submitted (see annex ii). 
 the hazard ratio was less favourable for enzalutamide-treated patients who received sequential 
 treatment with abiraterone (hr 1.23 [95% ci: (0.89, 1.68)]) and for enzalutamide-treated patients 
 who received sequential treatment with docetaxel (hr 1.47 [95% ci: (1.17, 1.85)]). notwithstanding 
 the inherent bias associated to these analyses, a possible cross-resistance among treatments cannot

 be totally ruled out. results of ongoing studies may provide further evidence on the sequential use of abiraterone-enzalutamide. patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
 treated with abiraterone has been included as</p><p>missing information in the rmp and a study will collect 
 data on the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in these patients.</p></section><section><header>risks unfavourable effects</header><p>overall, the treatment with enzalutamide is well tolerated, since the dose reductions, interruptions and discontinuations were similar or slightly higher for enzalutamide arm versus the placebo arm. 
 despite the large difference in observation time, the crude frequencies of many aes were often similar 
 across arms or only slightly higher in the enzalutamide group of the pivotal study mdv3100-03. 
 the incidence of aes in the mdv3100-03 study was high in both groups. more than 90% of patients 
 had some aes. the most common adverse events associated with enzalutamide treatment in 
 mdv3100-03 were fatigue (35.6%) and asthenia (13.0%), hot flush (18.0%), hypertension (13.9%), 
 fall (11.6%), non-pathological fractures (7.8%), and mental impairment (5.7%). the previously 
 identified important risk of seizure was observed in only 1 patient (0.1%) in each study arm of 
 mdv3100-3. when the aes reported were adjusted for length of exposure, hot flush, hypertension, fall, 
 and dysgeusia, were higher for patients treated with enzalutamide than in the placebo group.</p><p>
 grade 3 or higher aes occurring more frequently in the enzalutamide arm compared with placebo were 
 cataract (1.3% vs 0.1%) nausea (1.0% vs 0.5%) general physical health deterioration (2.1% vs 1.2%) 
 pneumonia (1.3% vs 0.8%) fall (1.4% vs 0.7%) spinal cord compression (3.8% vs 2.8%) syncope 
 (1.6% vs 0.9%) and hypertension (6.8% vs 2.3%). however, only hypertension and cataract remained 
 higher in the enzalutamide arm after adjusting for the longer safety reporting period.</p><p>
 the aes reported as primary reason for discontinuation appeared mostly related to the underlying 
 disease or comorbidities related to the age group. the frequency of patients discontinuing due to ae 
 was similar across arms in study mdv3100-3 (5.6% vs. 6.0% in enzalutamide and placebo arms, 
 respectively), as well as in the combined controlled population.</p></section><section><header>uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</header><p>enzalutamide has been associated with a potential for seizure in preclinical studies, a relationship with dose has been indicated in clinical studies, and a higher incidence compared with placebo was 
 observed in the registration study crpc2. however, the incidence of seizure was lower in mdv3100-03 
 and no increase over placebo was observed. no explanation for the lower incidence of 
 convulsions/seizure in the present mdv3100-3 compared with previous studies have been presented 
 by the mah. in the absence of other explanations, it is conceivable that this phenomenon could be due 
 to a better identification of study participants at risk for seizure at screening. seizure is adequately 
 addressed in the rmp.the time-adjusted event rate for second malignancy was increased in the 
 enzalutamide arm of mdv3100-3 compared to the placebo arm (3.3 vs. 1.8 events/ 100 py). given the 
 relatively short time to onset, it is not likely that the observed cases represent a cancer-inducing effect 
 of enzalutamide. furthermore, there is no obvious mechanism for a theoretical cancer-promoting effect 
 of enzalutamide. based on these considerations, secondary malignancy will be closely monitored in 
 psurs and will be specifically addressed in the already planned updates from mdv3100-3 to the chmp.

 the radiological progression of the disease. along with these important findings, other clinical endpoints 
 such as time to chemotherapy, time to skeletal event and psa response, are supporting the main 
 outcomes.</p><p>
 tolerability is of main importance in advanced cancer disease, and enzalutamide appears well-
 tolerated, with limited additional toxicity compared with placebo, on top of the underlying castration 
 therapy that is required in all crpc patients. in addition, although this is mainly due to the efficacy of 
 enzalutamide affecting disease related adverse events, the time to first grade 3 or more ae, as well as 
 the time to first serious adverse event is considerably longer in enzalutamide-treated patients 
 compared with placebo, which is considered of high value to patients.</p></section><section><header>benefit-risk balance</header><p>the benefit of enzalutamide over placebo treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation

 enzalutamide on top of castration therapy in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant

 reached is clear. the efficacy results along with the observed safety profile and good tolerability 
 support the use of enzalutamide in the proposed population. 
 the chmp considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to long-term efficacy: 
 the mah should submit updated results from the prevail study and more specifically updated os and
