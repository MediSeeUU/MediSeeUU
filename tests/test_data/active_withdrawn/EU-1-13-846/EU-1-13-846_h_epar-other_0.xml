 smpc and pl 
 results from study 9785-cl-0018 showed a mild inhibitory 
 effect of enzalutamide, at steady state, on p-gp in patients 
 with prostate cancer that received a single oral dose of the 
      page 3/23 label study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of enzalutamide on the pharmacokinetics of 
 substrates of p-glycoprotein (digoxin) and breast 
 cancer resistant protein (rosuvastatin) in male 
 subjects with prostate cancer. 
  additionally, the mah has taken the opportunity to 
 make an update to the information about the 
 excipients in section 4.4 of the smpc, to introduce 
 editorial changes in the smpc and in the package 
 leaflet, and to update the list of local representatives 
 in the package leaflet.

 probe p-gp substrate digoxin before and concomitantly with 
 enzalutamide. medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic 
 range that are substrates for p gp (e.g. colchicine, 
 dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution 
 when administered concomitantly with xtandi and may 
 require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma 
 concentrations. the same study 9785-cl-0018 showed that 
 at steady state, enzalutamide did not cause a clinically 
 meaningful change in exposure to the probe breast cancer 
 resistance protein (bcrp) substrate rosuvastatin in patients 
 with prostate cancer that received a single oral dose of 
 rosuvastatin before and concomitantly with enzalutamide. 
 no dose adjustment is necessary when a bcrp substrate is 
 co administered with xtandi.

 (os) was demonstrated in patients randomised to receive 
 enzalutamide compared with patients randomised to 
 receive placebo with a 26.6% reduction in risk of death 
 [hazard ratio (hr) = 0.734, (95% ci: 0.608; 0.885), p = 
 0.0011]. the median os was 67.0 months (95% ci: 64.0, 
 nr) in the enzalutamide group and 56.3 months (95% ci: 
 54.4, 63.0) in the placebo group. the median follow-up 
 time was 48.6 and 47.2 months for the enzalutamide and 
 placebo groups, respectively. thirty-three percent of 
 enzalutamide-treated and 65% of placebo-treated patients 
 received at least one subsequent antineoplastic therapy 
 that may prolong overall survival. 
  cases of second primary malignancies have been reported 
 in patients treated with enzalutamide in clinical studies. in 
 phase 3 clinical studies, the most frequently reported 
 events in enzalutamide treated patients, and greater than 
 placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of 
 the colon (0.2%), transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and 
 bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%). patients should 
 be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician 
 if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, 
 macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as 
 dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with 
 enzalutamide.

 at the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival

 enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant

 with placebo with a 29.4% reduction in risk of death

 there have been rare reports of posterior reversible 
 encephalopathy syndrome (pres) in patients receiving 
 xtandi. pres is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder 
 which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms 
 including seizure, headache, confusion, blindness, and 
 other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without 
 associated hypertension. a diagnosis of pres requires 
 confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic 
 resonance imaging (mri). discontinuation of xtandi in 
 patients who develop pres is recommended.

 in a clinical study in patients with metastatic crpc, xtandi 
 (160 mg once daily) had no clinically relevant effect on the 
 pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel 
 (75 mg/m2 by infusion every 3 weeks). the auc of 
 docetaxel decreased by 12% [geometric mean ratio (gmr) 
 =0.882 (90% ci: 0.767, 1.02)] while cmax decreased by 
 4% [gmr = 0.963 (90% ci: 0.834, 1.11)]. co-
 administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant 
 effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel; 
 however, an increase in the occurrence of docetaxel-
 induced neutropenia cannot be excluded.
  enzymes that may be induced by enzalutamide include 
 cyp2b6 but not cyp1a2 and patients taking medicinal 
 products that are substrates of cyp2b6 should be evaluated 
 for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in 
 effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) 
 during the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose 
 adjustment should be considered as appropriate.

 primarily albumin. the active metabolite is 95% bound to 
 plasma proteins. there was no protein binding 
 displacement between enzalutamide and other highly 
 bound drugs (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) in vitro.
  enzalutamide is extensively metabolized. there are two 
 major metabolites in human plasma: n desmethyl 
 enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative 
 (inactive). in vitro, n-desmethyl enzalutamide is 
 metabolized to the carboxylic acid metabolite by 
 carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the 
 metabolism of enzalutamide to the carboxylic acid 
 metabolite. n desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolized 
 by cyps in vitro.
  in vitro data indicate that n-desmethyl enzalutamide is not 
 a substrate for p-gp or bcrp.
  based on pharmacokinetic data from a study in japanese 
 patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically 
 relevant differences in exposure between japanese and 
 caucasians. there are insufficient data to evaluate potential 
 differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in 
 other races.
