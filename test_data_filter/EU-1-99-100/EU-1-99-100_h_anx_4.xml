 cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist. lhrh binds to membrane 
 receptors on pituitary cells. cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous lhrh to these receptors. 
 due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (lh and fsh).</p><p>
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland. the onset of 
 suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial stimulatory 
 effect.</p><p>
 in females, cetrorelix delays the lh surge and consequently ovulation. in women undergoing ovarian 
 stimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. following a single dose of 3 mg of 
 cetrorelix a duration of action of at least 4 days has been evaluated. on day 4 the suppression was 
 approximately 70%. at a dose of 0.25 mg per injection repeated injections every 24 hours will maintain the 
 effect of cetrorelix.</p><p>

 containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to support the onset of pregnancy) should be given according to the 
 reproductive medical centre´s practice. 
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a repeated ovarian

 the contents of one vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in 
 the morning or in the evening.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 or 6 of ovarian 
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant 
 gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period including the day of 
 ovulation induction.</p><p>
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 of ovarian 
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant 
 gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until the evening prior to 
 the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>how should you use cetrotide 0.25 mg?</header><p>the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor.</p><p>you can carry out the following injections yourself as long as you have been made aware by your doctor of the symptoms that may indicate 
 allergy, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate treatment.</p><p>
 cetrotide 0.25 mg is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. 
 to minimise local irritation, please select a different injection site each day.</p><p>17dissolve cetrotide 0.25 mg powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use a cetrotide 0.25 mg solution if it contains particles or if it is not clear.</p><p>
 before you administer cetrotide 0.25 mg yourself, please read the following instructions carefully:</p><p>
 1. 
 wash your hands. it is important that your hands and all items you use are as clean as possible.</p><p>
 2. 
 lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection needle 
 with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. 
 flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an alcohol 
 swab.</p><p>
 4. 
 take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled syringe 
 and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 5. 
 push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial by 
 slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. 
 leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without residue. 
 avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.</p><p>
 7. 
 draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert the vial, pull 
 back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from the side 
 through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the liquid. it is 
 important to withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>
 8. 
 detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the grey 
 mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 9. 
 invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch the 
 needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. 
 choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the second 
 alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand. gently pinch up the 
 skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.</p><p>
 11.

 additionally the pack contains</p><p>
 • one pre-filled syringe with solvent (water for injections) for parenteral use for dissolving the powder in the vial 
 • one injection needle with a yellow mark for injecting the water into the vial and withdrawing the solution from the vial 
 • one injection needle with a grey mark for injecting the solution • two alcohol swabs for cleaning purposes.</p><p>23</p></section><section><header>pharmacotherapeutic group how does cetrotide 3 mg work?</header><p>cetrotide 3 mg inhibits the effects of a natural hormone, called luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh). lhrh regulates the secretion of another hormone, called luteinising hormone (lh), which induces 
 ovulation during the menstrual cycle. cetrotide 3 mg inhibits premature ovulation which is undesirable 
 during hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation as only mature egg cells are suitable for fertilisation.</p></section><section><header>therapeutic indications why use cetrotide 3 mg?</header><p>cetrotide 3 mg is used to prevent premature ovulation during a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.</p><p>
 in clinical trials cetrotide 3 mg was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however, limited 
 experience with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested similar efficacy. hmg and fsh 
 are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header>contra-indications when should you not use cetrotide 3 mg?</header><p>do not use cetrotide 3 mg if you</p><p>
 • are allergic to cetrorelix acetate, mannitol or exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similar to cetrotide 3 mg).</p><p> 
 • are pregnant or breast-feeding • have already reached your menopause • have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>precautions for use what precautions have to be taken?</header><p>during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg maturation). 
 for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient information leaflet of the gonadotropin-
 containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to support the onset of pregnancy) should be given according to the 
 reproductive medical centre´s practice. 
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 3 mg during a repeated ovarian 
 stimulation procedure. therefore you should use cetrotide 3 mg in repeated cycles only after a careful 
 risk/benefit evaluation by your doctor.</p><p>24</p></section><section><header>special warnings</header><p>special care should be taken in women with an active allergic condition or a known history of allergy.</p><p>since treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions it is important that you 
 inform your doctor of any allergies.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines</header><p>as far as it is known, cetrotide 3 mg does not impair your ability to drive or to operate machinery.</p></section><section><header>what special precautions should pregnant or breast-feeding women take?</header><p>you should not use cetrotide 3 mg if you are already pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>interactions what other products influence the effect of cetrotide 3 mg and what other products can cetrotide 3 mg 
 effect?</header><p>experimental investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medications that are metabolised in the liver. however, the possibility of interactions with commonly used medicinal products cannot entirely 
 be excluded.</p></section><section><header>instructions for proper use how much of cetrotide 3 mg should you use and how often should you use it?</header><p>the following statements apply to cetrotide 3 mg unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide 3 mg.</p><p>
 the contents of 1 vial (3 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered on day 7 of ovarian stimulation 
 (approximately 132 to 144 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant 
 gonadotropins.</p><p> 
 a single dose of cetrotide 3 mg results in a duration of action of at least 4 days. if the follicle growth does 
 not allow ovulation induction on the fifth day after injection of cetrotide 3 mg, additionally</p><p>
 0.25 mg cetrorelix (cetrotide 0.25 mg) should be administered once daily beginning 96 hours after the 
 injection of cetrotide 3 mg until the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>how should you use cetrotide 3 mg?</header><p>the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor.</p><p>you can carry out the following injections yourself as long as you have been made aware by your doctor of the symptoms that may indicate 
 allergy, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate treatment. 
 cetrotide 3 mg is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel.</p><p>
 dissolve cetrotide 3 mg powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use a 
 cetrotide 3 mg solution if it contains particles or if it is not clear.</p><p>

 1. 
 wash your hands. it is important that your hands and all items you use are as clean as possible.</p><p>25 2. lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection needle 
 with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an alcohol 
 swab.</p><p>
 4. take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled syringe 
 and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 5. push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial by 
 slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without residue.

 back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from the side 
 through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the liquid. it is 
 important to withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>
 8. detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the grey 
 mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 9. invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch the 
 needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the second 
 alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand. gently pinch up the 
 skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.</p><p>
 11. hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at an angle of
