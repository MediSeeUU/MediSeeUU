 cetrotide 0.25 mg is for subcutaneous injection into the lower abdominal wall.</p><p>
 the first administration of cetrotide should be performed under the supervision of a physician and 
 under conditions where treatment of possible pseudo-allergic reactions is immediately available.</p><p>the 
 following injections may be self-administered as long as the patient is made aware of the signs and 
 symptoms that may indicate hypersensitivity, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for 
 immediate medical intervention.</p><p>
 the contents of 1 vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in 
 the morning or in the evening. following the first administration, it is advised that the patient be kept 
 under medical supervision for 30 minutes to ensure there is no allergic/pseudo-allergic reaction to the 
 injection.</p><p>facilities for the treatment of such reactions should be immediately available.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should commence on day 5 or 6 of 
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period 
 including the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should commence on day 5 of 
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until 
 the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>3</p><p>for instructions for use and handling, see section 6.6.</p></section><section><header n="4.3">4.3 contraindications</header><p>• hypersensitivity to cetrorelix acetate or any structural analogues of gnrh, extrinsic peptide hormones or mannitol.</p><p>

 during or following ovarian stimulation an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event 
 must be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins.</p><p>an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous 
 electrolytes/colloids and heparin therapy.</p><p>
 luteal phase support should be given according to the reproductive medical centre´s practice. 
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a repeated 
 ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore cetrotide 0.25 mg should be used in repeated cycles only 
 after a careful risk/benefit evaluation.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medications that are metabolised by cytochrome p450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. however, interactions with

 cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist. lhrh binds to membrane 
 receptors on pituitary cells. cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous lhrh to these 
 receptors. due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (lh and 
 fsh).</p><p>
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland. the onset 
 of suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial 
 stimulatory effect.</p><p>
 in females, cetrorelix delays the lh surge and consequently ovulation. in women undergoing ovarian 
 stimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. following a single dose of 3 mg of 
 cetrorelix a duration of action of at least 4 days has been evaluated. on day 4 the suppression was 
 approximately 70%. at a dose of 0.25 mg per injection repeated injections every 24 hours will 
 maintain the effect of cetrorelix.</p><p>

 after termination of treatment.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>the absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix after subcutaneous administration is about 85%.</p><p>
 the total plasma clearance and the renal clearance are 1.2 ml x min
 -1 x kg-1 and 0.1 ml x min-1 x kg-1 , respectively. the volume of distribution (v
 d,area) is 1.1 l x kg-1. the mean terminal half-lives following intravenous and subcutaneous administration are about 12 h and 30 h, respectively, demonstrating the 
 effect of absorption processes at the injection site. the subcutaneous administration of single doses 
 (0.25 mg to 3 mg cetrorelix) and also daily dosing over 14 days show linear kinetics.</p><p> 5</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>no target organ toxicity could be observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix. no signs of drug-related local

 additionally, for each vial the packs contain</p><p>
 • one pre-filled syringe with solvent (water for injections) for parenteral use for dissolving the powder in the vial 
 • one injection needle with a yellow mark for injecting the water into the vial and withdrawing the solution from the vial 
 • one injection needle with a grey mark for injecting the solution • two alcohol swabs for cleaning purposes.</p><p>
 cetrotide 0.25 mg inhibits the effects of a natural hormone, called luteinising hormone releasing 
 hormone (lhrh). lhrh regulates the secretion of another hormone, called luteinising hormone 
 (lh), which induces ovulation during the menstrual cycle. cetrotide 0.25 mg inhibits premature 
 ovulation which is undesirable during hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation as only mature egg 
 cells are suitable for fertilisation.</p><p>28</p></section><section><header>therapeutic indications</header><p>cetrotide 0.25 mg is used to prevent premature ovulation during a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.</p><p>
 in clinical trials cetrotide 0.25 mg was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however, 
 limited experience with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested similar efficacy. 
 hmg and fsh are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you use cetrotide
   do not use cetrotide:</header><p>• if you are allergic to cetrorelix acetate, mannitol or exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similar to cetrotide 0.25 mg).</p><p> 
 • if you are pregnant or breast-feeding • if you have already reached your menopause • if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>take special care with cetrotide:</header><p>special care should be taken in women with an active allergic condition or a known history of allergy.</p><p>since treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions it is important 
 that you inform your doctor of any allergies.</p><p>
 during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can 
 occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg 
 maturation). for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient information leaflet of the 
 gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to support the onset of pregnancy) should be given according to the 
 reproductive medical centre´s practice. 
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a repeated 
 ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore you should use cetrotide 0.25 mg in repeated cycles only 
 after a careful risk/benefit evaluation by your doctor.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding:</header><p>you should not use cetrotide 0.25 mg if you are already pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines:</header><p>as far as it is known, cetrotide 0.25 mg does not impair your ability to drive or to operate machinery.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines:</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p><p>
 experimental investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medications that are 
 metabolised in the liver. however, the possibility of interactions with commonly used medicinal 
 products cannot entirely be excluded.</p><p>29</p></section><section><header n="3">3. how to use cetrotide
   how much cetrotide should you use and how often should you use it?</header><p>the following statements apply to cetrotide 0.25 mg unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide 0.25 mg.</p><p>
 the contents of one vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, 
 either in the morning or in the evening.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 or 6 of 
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period 
 including the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 of ovarian 
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or 
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until 
 the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>how should cetrotide be administered?</header><p>the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor.</p><p>you can carry out the following injections yourself as long as you have been made aware by your doctor of the symptoms that may 
 indicate allergy, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate treatment.</p><p>
 cetrotide 0.25 mg is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the 
 navel. to minimise local irritation, please select a different injection site each day.</p><p>
 dissolve cetrotide 0.25 mg powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use 
 a cetrotide 0.25 mg solution if it contains particles or if it is not clear.</p></section><section><header>before you administer cetrotide yourself, please read the following instructions carefully:</header><p>1. wash your hands. it is important that your hands and all items you use are as clean as possible.</p><p>
 2. lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection 
 needle with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an 
 alcohol swab.</p><p>
 4. take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled 
 syringe and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.</p><p>
 5. push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial 
 by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without 
 residue. avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.</p><p>
 7. draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert the vial, 
 pull back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from 
 the side through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the 
 liquid. it is important to withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>30 8. detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the 
 grey mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the 
 needle.</p><p>
 9. invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch 
 the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the 
 second alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand. 
 gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.</p><p>
 11. hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at an 
 angle of about 45 degree.</p><p>
 12. once the needle has been inserted completely, release your grasp of the skin.</p><p>
 13. pull back gently the plunger of the syringe. if blood appears continue as described in step 14. if 
 no blood appears, inject the solution slowly by pushing the plunger gently forward. after all of 
 the solution is injected, withdraw the needle slowly, applying gentle pressure with the alcohol 
 swab on the skin where the needle was inserted. withdraw the needle at the same angle as it was 
 inserted.</p><p>
 14. if blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently apply pressure to the injection 
 site. do not use this solution but empty the syringe in a sink. start again with step 1.</p><p>
 15. use the syringe and needles only once. dispose of the syringe and needles immediately after 
 use (put the covers on the needles to avoid injury).</p></section><section><header>if you use more cetrotide than you should:</header><p>overdosage of cetrotide 0.25 mg may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with acute toxic effects. therefore, in case of overdosage no specific measures are required.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take cetrotide:</header><p>if you forgot to take cetrotide 0.25 mg on one day, please contact your doctor immediately and ask for advice.</p><p>
 ideally cetrotide 0.25 mg should be administered at 24 hours intervals. but if you missed to 
 administer cetrotide 0.25 mg at the right time it is no problem to administer this dose at a different 
 time of the same day.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, cetrotide can have side effects.</p><p>
 mild and transient reactions may occur at the injection site like reddening, itching, and swelling.</p><p>
 rare cases of severe generalised allergic reactions have also been reported.</p><p>
 occasionally systemic side effects, like nausea and headache have been reported. in addition, a single 
 case of pruritus has been reported during treatment with cetrorelix.</p><p>
 occasionally, stimulation of ovaries with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg maturation) may 
 lead to a so-called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). symptoms like abdominal pain,</p><p>31 tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and breathing difficulties may indicate an ohss. please inform your doctor immediately, if you feel such symptoms.</p><p>if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. storing cetrotide</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>
 do not store above 25
 °c.</p><p> 
 keep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light.</p><p>
 the cetrotide 0.25 mg powder in the vial and the solvent in the pre-filled syringe have the same expiry 
 date. it is printed on the labels and on the carton. do not use after the expiry date stated on the label or 
 the carton.</p><p>
 the solution should be used immediately after preparation.</p><p>
