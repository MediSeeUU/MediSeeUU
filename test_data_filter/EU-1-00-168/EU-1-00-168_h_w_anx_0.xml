 therapy is bleeding. the concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. as 
 fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy, bleeding from recent 
 puncture site may occur. therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all possible 
 bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous puncture sites, cutdown sites and 
 needle puncture sites). the use of rigid catheters as well as intramuscular injections and non-essential 
 handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim 
 pharma kg.</p><p>
 most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival 
 bleeding were observed.</p><p>
 should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration 
 should be terminated immediately. administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has 
 been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. in the few patients who fail to respond 
 to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. transfusion of 
 cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory 
 reassessment after each administration. a target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with 
 cryoprecipitate infusion. antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. the use of

 data from more than 12,000 patients treated during phase i, ii and iii did not reveal any clinically 
 relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used in patients with ami and concomitantly 
 used with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg.</p><p>
 medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine,

 mechanism of action 
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa 
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus 
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the 
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to 
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 α2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in 
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u, 
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.</p><p>
 clinical effects 
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.</p><p>
 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is 
 therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, 
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this 
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial 
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.</p><p>
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully 
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in 
 7 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to</p><p>what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma 
 proteins in humans.</p></section><section><header>after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase  in patients with acute myocardial infarction, tenecteplase  antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose 
 dependence of tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half 
 life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life 
 is 129 ± 87 min, and plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.</header><p>increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.</p><p>
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans is not 
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with 
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal 
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and reversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which 
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity 
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
 anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.</p><p>
 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous 
 administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: l-arginine, phosphoric acid, polysorbate 20. solvent: water for injections</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2 incompatibilities</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is incompatible with dextrose infusion solutions.</p><p>

 mechanism of action 
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa 
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus 
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the 
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to 
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.</p><p>
 pharmacodynamic effects 
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 α2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in 
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u, 
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.</p><p>
 clinical effects 
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.</p><p>
 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is 
 therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, 
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this 
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial 
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.</p><p>
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully 
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in 
 16 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma 
 proteins in humans. 
 after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
 tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of 
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean 
 +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and 
 plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.</p><p>
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age 
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.</p><p>
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase</p><p>in humans is not

 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
 anaphylaxis.</p><p>
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and

 - diabetic haemorrhagic retinopathy or other haemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions - active peptic ulceration - arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation - neoplasm with increased bleeding risk - any known history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack or dementia - hypersensitivity to the active substance tenecteplase and to any of the excipients</p></section><section><header n="4.4">4.4 special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>bleeding the most common complication encountered during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg 
 therapy is bleeding. the concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. as 
 fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy, bleeding from recent 
 puncture site may occur. therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all possible 
 bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous puncture sites, cutdown sites and 
 needle puncture sites). the use of rigid catheters as well as intramuscular injections and non-essential 
 handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim 
 pharma kg.</p><p>
 most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival 
 bleeding were observed.</p><p>
 should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration 
 should be terminated immediately. administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has 
 been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. in the few patients who fail to respond 
 to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. transfusion of 
 cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory 
 reassessment after each administration. a target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with 
 cryoprecipitate infusion. antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. the use of 
 tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy has to be carefully evaluated in order to 
 balance the potential risks with anticipated benefits under the following conditions:</p><p>
 - systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm hg</p><p>- cerebrovascular disease - recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days) - high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation - any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection - advanced age, i.e. over 75 years - low body weight &lt; 60 kg</p><p>

 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
 exposure.</p><p>
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced 
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.</p><p> 
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.</p><p>
 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous 
 administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>powder: l-arginine, phosphoric acid, polysorbate 20. solvent: water for injections</p></section><section><header n="6.2">6.2 incompatibilities</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is incompatible with dextrose infusion solutions.</p></section><section><header n="6.3">6.3 shelf life</header><p>shelf life as packaged for sale 2 years
