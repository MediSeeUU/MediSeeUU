 what targretin is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in targretin, bexarotene, belongs to a group of medicines known asretinoids, which are related to vitamin a. targretin capsules are used by patients with
 advanced stage cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) whose disease has not responded to other
 therapies. ctcl is a condition in which certain cells of the body’s lymph system called
 t-lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. before you take targretin

 (high blood cholesterol or high blood triglycerides), have a condition known as
 hypervitaminosis a, have uncontrolled thyroid disease, have insufficient liver function
 or have an ongoing systemic infection.</p></section><section><header>take special care with targretin:</header><p>- if you have a known hypersensitivity to retinoids (related to vitamin a), suffer from

 monitored during therapy.

 medicine.

 drive or operate machinery.</p></section><section><header>important information about some of the ingredients of targretin:</header><p>butylated hydroxyanisol, an ingredient in targretin, is an irritant to the eyes, skin, andmucous membranes, therefore the capsules must be swallowed intact.</p></section><section><header>taking other medicines:</header><p>before starting treatment, make sure your doctor knows if you are taking medicines(including those not prescribed by your doctor), such as ketoconazole and itraconazole (used
 against fungal infections), erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin (used against bacterial
 infections), phenytoin and phenobarbital (used against seizures), gemfibrozil (used to reduce
 high levels of fats in the blood such as triglycerides and cholesterol), vitamin a supplements,
 protease inhibitors (used against viral infections), tamoxifen (used against some forms of

 more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effect of the
