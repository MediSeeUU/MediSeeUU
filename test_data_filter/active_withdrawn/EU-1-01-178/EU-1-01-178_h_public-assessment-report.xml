 treatment</p><p>2</p></section><section><header>introduction</header><p>targretin contains the new chemical entity bexarotene (inn), an anti-neoplastic retinoid. it is related to the other retinoids. it is indicated for the treatment of skin manifestations of advanced stage 
 cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment. the 
 recommended initial dose is 300 mg/m
 2/day, to be taken as a single dose with a meal.</p><p>
 the incidence of ctcl is approximately 1200 new patients annually in europe with a prevalence of 
 about 16,000. the term ctcl includes mycosis fungoides and sézary syndrome. they usually 
 manifest in the skin as a progressive disease, more common in men, age range usually 45-65 years.</p><p>
 extra cutaneous sites are involved later in the course of the disease. sézary syndrome is an aggressive 
 systemic variant of mycosis fungoides where there are abnormal circulating lymphocytes. sézary cells 
 are hyperchromatic mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood containing convoluted or ceribriform 
 nuclei.</p><p>
 current systemic therapy for ctcl includes interferon 
 α, retinoids and puva therapy, either alone or in combination, and different monochemotherapy regimens. radiotherapy and electron beam therapy 
 have been employed for localised lesions. photophoresis with oral metoxypsoralen and extracorporal 
 irradiation of leukocytes and polychemotherapy regimens have been given for sezary syndrome.</p><p>
 ctcl patients usually survive for many years after diagnosis, but there is a risk of secondary 
 cutaneous malignancies, such as squamous cell carcinoma, because of the altered immunology caused 
 by the disease or its treatment. the relative risk of skin cancers or melanoma is some 6-8 fold. 
 ulceration of ctcl with secondary infection is common and about half of the patients die from 
 infection. the risk of infection is higher with immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p>
 retinoids, such as etretinate and isotretinoin, have been used successfully to treat ctcl. they have 
 been used both as sole agents and as part of combination therapy.</p><p>
 bexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and 
 activation of the three retinoid x receptors (rxrs): rxr
 α, β, and γ. once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and 
 proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin sensitisation. the ability of the rxrs to form heterodimers with 
 various receptor partners that are important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the 
 biological activities of bexarotene are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the retinoic 
 acid receptors (rars). in vitro, bexarotene inhibits the growth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic 
 and squamous cell origin. in vivo, bexarotene causes tumour regression in some animal models and 
 prevents tumour induction in others. however, the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the 
 treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) is unknown.</p></section><section><header>part ii: chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects composition</header><p>targretin capsules are presented as off-white oblong soft gelatin capsules, imprinted with the word “targretin” using blue ink and containing a suspension of 75 mg of micronised bexarotene in 
 macrogol 400. the capsule shell is made from gelatin, which is of animal origin. gelatin complies 
 with the note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephelopathy 
 agent. 
 capsules are packaged in white 200-ml high-density polyethylene (hdpe) bottle with a white 
 polypropylene child-resistant cap, and a tamper-evident foil inner-seal. bottles are packaged in an 
 outer cardboard container.</p></section><section><header>active substance</header><p>the active substance bexarotene, supplied by raylo chemical inc., is a new synthetic compound representing a sub-class of retinoids, but it is structurally distinct from the vitamin a derived retinoids. 
 its chemical name is 4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8- tetrahydro-2-naphtalenyl)vinyl] benzene 
 carboxylic acid. 
 3</p><p>the synthesis of bexarotene has evolved through two routes, which are not basically different. the second (route b) was more economic and more robust than the earlier route a and the impurity profile 
 has been improved. 
 the first route (route a) was used for early pre-clinical studies and to produce the first lots for clinical 
 trials. 
 route b is the intended commercial route to manufacture the drug substance; route b material has 
 been used in the 6-month toxicology studies and for the majority of clinical studies. 
 raylo manufactures the active substance at two facilities sites (argyll rd. and clover bar). 
 the equipment used for the bexarotene manufacturing process at the argyll road facility and the 
 clover bar facility is equivalent and similar chemical and physical characteristics of drug substance 
 issued from the two sites have been shown.</p><p>the drug substance is prepared using synthetic 
 transformations that are well precedented in the chemical literature.</p><p>
 the specifications contain all appropriate tests for identity, potency, purity and stability of the active 
 substance. bexarotene is identified by two methods: ir spectroscopy and hplc.</p><p>
 the specifications for residual solvents that may be present are consistent with ich guidance on 
 residual solvents and therefore should not give rise to any toxicological problems. 
 the assay and determination of related substances are done using an isocratic hplc.</p><p>
 two identified impurities,</p><p>have been routinely detected in bexarotene at levels greater than 0.1%. a 
 further impurity was difficult to detect and although this impurity was present at trace levels (&lt;0.1%) 
 in many of stability study samples, it was not usually detected or reported. a limit of 0.2% has been 
 specified. 
 the specifications for impurities are qualified by the 6-month rat toxicology study.</p><p>
 particle size limits are consistent with the data of all available micronised bexarotene batches.</p><p>
 batch analysis data were provided on seven batches (3 pilot and 4 production-scale) of active 
 substance manufactured by route b and used in safety studies, clinical trials and stability studies. 
 these data confirm the consistency and uniformity of the synthesis.</p><p>
 stability studies of three representative commercial batches of micronised bexarotene have been 
 carried out according to ich storage conditions. data observed for up two years at 25°c / 60% rh 
 and for 6 months at 40°c/75 %rh justifies a re-test period of two years. the product should be stored 
 at a temperature not exceeding 30°c. 
 additional stability data performed at 5°c for 24 months and for 12 months at 30°c / 60%rh as well 
 as photostability investigations confirmed the stability of bexarotene. 
 nevertheless, bexarotene should be protected from extreme heat and from excessive light exposure.</p></section><section><header>other ingredients</header><p>the excipients of the bulk suspension (macrogol 400, polysorbate 20, povidone k-90, butylated hydroxyanisole) and the capsule shell (gelatin and titanium dioxide) comply with the corresponding 
 pheur monograph. the specifications for polysorbate 20 include an upper limit of nmt 1 ppm for 
 ethylene oxide as additive specification to the pheur. monograph.</p><p>
 although the specifications of excipients relative to capsule shell (sorbitol special –glycerine blend 
 and blue ink colorcon) are limited, they have been found satisfactory. for the colorant fd&amp;c blue 
 n°2 aluminium lake (e132) used in the blue printing ink the compliance with the directive78/25/eec 
 has been confirmed. 
 4</p></section><section><header>product development and finished product</header><p>the final polyethylene glycol based formulation was selected after evaluation of protype formulations with respect to hydrophilic-lypophilic character of vehicle, viscosity of suspension, solubility of 
 bexarotene in vehicle and bexarotene particle size.</p><p>
 a series of 10 small pilot scale batches (~25.000 capsules) were manufactured at r.p scherer. release 
 data for these small batches showed consistent results for dissolution, content uniformity, bht content 
 and assay, with an rsd for content uniformity no greater than 2.0 %. 
 eight scale-up batches including the three registration batches were manufactured using the production 
 scale manufacturing process. type of equipment used, main steps of manufacturing process are 
 reported. the differences with the pilot scale are minor. 
 release data showed similar satisfactory results to pilot scale batches.</p><p>
 the proposed commercial composition of targretin capsule is essentially similar to the formulations 
 used in the clinical trials.</p><p>
 the manufacturing process involves the preparation of a suspension of the active substance in the 
 excipients, which is then encapsulated in soft gelatin.</p><p>
 the manufacturing equipment is described (class and subclass). 
 appropriate in-process controls are in place.</p><p>
 a manufacturing process validation report is submitted for three consecutive full scale production 
 batches manufactured with the commercial process parameters specifications (mixer speeds and times) 
 validated during the additional mixing studies. the results of the validation studies are satisfactory.</p><p>
 control testing of the finished product offers a full guarantee in terms of safety, efficacy and 
 reproducibility of the process.</p><p>
 the control test and specifications for finished product are adequately drawn up. the identity is 
 confirmed by ir-spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. hplc was also used for 
 the assay and the detection of related substances.</p><p>
 the dissolution test is performed in a two–tier dissolution testing approach, with 0.005% of pancreatin 
 present in the medium. as there is no evidence to suggest that the dissolution method is discriminatory 
 with respect to particle size of the capsule fill suspension (complete dissolution of the bexarotene 
 occurs in less than ten minutes when the fill suspension is added to the dissolution medium) the 
 marketing authorisation holder has included a release test of the bexarotene particle size distribution 
 in the drug product, to ensure that this attribute is controlled in the finished product. 
 the limits for the bexarotene particle size distribution in the fill suspension are adequately justified.</p><p> the impurity limits in the finished product specification are justified by toxicology studies.</p><p>
 the limits for the microbial contamination are based on the requirements of the usp, but 
 harmonisation of the ph.eur. with the usp with regard to microbiological quality has been realised 
 with the acceptance of the step 4 document for ich q6a.</p><p>
 results from 3 commercial batches with printed capsules are presented. the results confirm 
 satisfactory uniformity of the product at release and indicate reliable and consistent performance of the 
 product in clinical use.</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>the results from the stability studies indicate that the capsules exhibited satisfactory potency, purity and physical integrity. the physical appearance of the capsules and the dissolution data obtained show 
 no change during storage. the results support the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, as defined in the spc. 
 5 the marketing authorisation holder has committed to provide stability data (both real and accelerated data) generated on the first three consecutive production batches of finished product (see section ii.3,)</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>in summary, the documentation of substances, materials, methods of production as well as the quality controls is sufficient to ensure a product of appropriate and consistent quality. information has been 
 provided in the dossier demonstrating that the medicinal product is made in compliance with the 
 cpmp note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy 
 agents via medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>part iii: toxico-pharmacological aspects pharmacodynamics 
 in vitro studies</header><p>the activity of bexarotene has not been explored in models of ctcl, since no pre-clinical models exist. therefore the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous t-cell 
 lymphoma (ctcl) is unknown. however, the following cell systems are known to respond to rar-
 active ligands:</p></section><section><header>promyelocytic leukaemia cell system</header><p>in the hl-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cell system bexarotene induced markers consistent with the induction of apoptosis, dna laddering and morphological changes. at rxr/rar-activating 
 concentrations bexarotene was able to inhibit the growth and induce differentiation of the cells and 
 was also capable of inducing differentiation of leukaemia cells from patients, including those with 
 acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl). when tested against the apl cell line nb4 (which harbours 
 the same t (5:17) chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of apl patients) bexarotene at 
 concentrations &gt; 1 
 µm was able to induce cell cycle arrest in g1 and to induce the expression of the granulocyte diffentiation antigen cd11b on the cell surface.</p></section><section><header>hbe cells</header><p>bexarotene inhibited transcription factor ap-1 (ap-1) activity in cultured human bronchial epithelial (hbe) cells. other agents known to inhibit ap-1 activity also inhibited the expression of the 
 differentiation markers. bexarotene has been demonstrated to have anti-ap-1 activity mediated via 
 rxr
 α. this effect may account for its ability to inhibit cellular proliferation.</p></section><section><header>squamous cell carcinoma xenograft tumours in nude mice</header><p>9-cis-ra suppressed the differentiated squamous phenotype with the increased presence of basal tumour cells; bexarotene caused no change in the highly differentiated phenotype of the tumour. in 
 addition, bexarotene inhibited the growth of two primary human hnscc xenograft tumours grown in 
 nude mice, but did not inhibit the growth of 1483 hnscc xenograft tumours; bexarotene was not a 
 potent antiproliferative agent in these cells.</p></section><section><header>prostate cancer cell line (lncap)</header><p>bexarotene was ineffective at inhibiting the growth of xenograft tumours derived from the human prostate cancer cell line or the transplantable dunning prostate tumour in the rat.</p></section><section><header>cultured aids-ks cells</header><p>bexarotene (10-8 – 10-6 m) inhibited cellular proliferation in culture in a dose-dependent manner and similar to atra and rar ligand. these data suggested that bexarotene may have inhibitory activity 
 for aids-related ks cells in vivo.</p></section><section><header>cultured breast cancer cells</header><p>growth of the human oestrogen receptor (er)-positive breast carcinoma cell line, t47d, was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by bexarotene. bexarotene and tam appeared to be synergistic 
 in the inhibition of the growth of these cells. 
 6</p></section><section><header>in vivo studies</header><p>bexarotene inhibited the development of carcinogen-induced mammary carcinomas in the rat similar to tamoxifen (tam). however, bexarotene did not induce significant changes in circulating levels of 
 oestradiol, progesterone or prolactin. in addition, bexarotene and tam appeared to be synergistic in 
 this model. when bexarotene was added to the tam regimen in animals with tam-resistant 
 mammary carcinomas, 94% of tumours had an objective response.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamic drug interactions</header><p>when bexarotene or gemfibrozil was administered to rats, bifunctional enzyme (be) and acyl-coa oxidase rnas were induced, and the combination of bexarotene and gemfibrozil led to greater 
 induction.</p></section><section><header>general and safety pharmacology programme</header><p>studies investigating cardiovascular and neuropharmacological parameters in rats were performed. bexarotene administered to rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day did not significantly affect mean arterial 
 blood pressure or heart rate.</p><p>statistically significant changes were observed in two clotting 
 parameters, but were not biologically important.</p><p>
 hypertriglyceridaemia was seen after oral administration of bexarotene in a variety of animal models. 
 oral administration of bexarotene to rats increased the plasma levels of apoa-i and hdl in the 
 circulation. induction of apoa-i occurred at the transcriptional level.</p><p>
 the effects of bexarotene on plasma lipids were determined in male rabbits following 4 days of oral 
 dosing with 0, 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day.</p><p>in animals receiving 100 mg/kg, total cholesterol and 
 triglycerides were increased approximately 3- and 10-fold, respectively, whereas hdl cholesterol was 
 unchanged.</p><p>
 changes in clinical biochemistry included increases in alkaline phosphatase (alk), serum alanine 
 aminotransferase (alt), and serum aspartate aminotransferase (ast), sodium, and globulin and total 
 bilirubin.</p><p>
 a study was conducted in rats to determine the neuropharmacological effects produced of up to 100 
 mg/kg/day bexarotene for four consecutive days. all rats exhibited normal social behaviour and body 
 weight gain. there were no changes in body temperature.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics single-dose studies
  
 oral administration</header><p>plasma bexarotene concentration data from pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies in the rat and dog demonstrated that bexarotene was orally bioavailable. the increase in plasma auc values appeared 
 proportional at lower doses and less than dose-proportional at higher doses. from oil formulations, 
 nonmicronised bexarotene was 30-40% bioavailable in rats and 7.5% bioavailable in dogs. maximum 
 plasma bexarotene concentrations (c
 max) generally occurred a few hours post-dose (tmax =2 to 4 hr).</p></section><section><header>intravenous (i.v.) administration</header><p>following i.v. administration of bexarotene, clearance was 10 to 20 ml/min/kg in the rat and 2 to 4 ml/min/kg in the dog. i.v. kinetics in plasma appeared multiphasic in both species. the t
 ½ of bexarotene was 2 hr to 3 hr in rats and 3 hr to 6 hr in dogs. bexarotene’s volume of distribution was 
 close to 1 l/kg, consistent with minimal retention of bexarotene in the extravascular tissues. there was 
 no overall sex difference in pharmacokinetics in either species.</p></section><section><header>repeat dose studies</header><p>in rats repeat dose cmax and auc values increased with increasing dose but were less than dose proportional. plasma bexarotene concentrations in rats were almost always dose-dependently lower 
 7 after repeat-dose administration than concentrations after a single dose. the extent of this reduction in concentrations generally did not increase beyond 28 days of dosing. the magnitude of the reduction 
 tended to be greater in male rats than in female rats.</p><p>
 in all of the toxicity studies conducted in dogs, systemic exposure to bexarotene was dose-dependent. 
 there was dose-dependent reduction in exposure associated with repeated dosing. in a 28-day toxicity 
 study in which nonmicronised bexarotene was administered in babassu oil at 10 to 200 mg/kg/day, 
 c
 max and auc(0-6) values were 2-fold and 4-fold lower respectively on day 28 compared to day 1 at 10 mg/kg and 3-fold and 6-fold lower at 30 mg/kg.</p></section><section><header>absorption</header><p>the oral bioavailability of bexarotene was formulation-dependent. for micronised drug in rat and nonmicronised drug in dog, suspensions in oil tended to provide greater bioavailability than 
 suspensions containing peg. bioavailability of nonmicronised bexarotene was also significantly 
 greater from a peg-based solution formulation than that from oil- or peg-based suspension 
 formulations in dogs. these data suggested that dissolution may be rate-limiting for drug absorption 
 and that bexarotene particle size reduction could enhance bioavailability.</p><p>these studies established 
 that micronised bexarotene was about six times more bioavailable than nonmicronised bexarotene and 
 that different lots of micronised bexarotene exhibited similar pharmacokinetics.</p><p>an experimental lot 
 of clinical capsules that developed pellicles in dissolution testing displayed pharmacokinetics similar 
 to one that did not form pellicles. the marketing authorisation holder stated that data from these 
 studies aided in selection of the clinical dose in transitioning from nonmicronised to micronised 
 bexarotene in phase i-ii trials, and setting bexarotene particle size specifications for targretin capsules 
 intended for commercial use.</p></section><section><header>distribution</header><p>a study in rats demonstrated that drug-related radioactivity distributed essentially throughout the body after an oral dose of radiolabelled bexarotene. at the 4-hr time point, radioactivity was present in all of 
 the 26 tissues examined. other than organs of the gastro-intestinal tract, tissue-to-plasma radioactivity 
 ratios were greatest in liver, kidneys and adrenals over four timepoints examined (4, 8, 24 and 48 hrs). 
 no substantial retention occurred in any tissue; less than 1% of the radioactivity remained in the rats at 
 48 hrs. 
 a study in athymic mice revealed that bexarotene was capable of penetrating into solid tumour.</p></section><section><header>protein binding studies</header><p>bexarotene was highly protein bound (&gt;99.9%) at concentrations present in the rat and dog plasma in toxicity studies.</p></section><section><header>metabolism</header><p>in the rat and dog bexarotene was metabolised primarily by p450-dependent oxidation and glucuronidation. systemic exposure to these metabolites (6- or 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- or 7- oxo-
 bexarotene) was found to be less than that to parent compound after both single and multiple doses. 6-
 hydroxy-bexarotene was a major circulating metabolite of bexarotene and glucuronides were the most 
 prevalent bexarotene metabolites in bile. in rats, the primary biliary glucuronide was the acyl 
 glucuronide of the parent compound. in dogs, the primary biliary glucuronide was the acyl 
 glucuronide of 6- or 7-hydroxy-bexarotene. overall bexarotene metabolism was qualitatively similar 
 between the rat and the dog.</p></section><section><header>excretion</header><p>in a rat oral-dose tissue distribution study using 100 mg/kg radiolabelled bexarotene, &gt;90% of the radioactivity was excreted in the faeces by 48 hours in both sexes. presence of the majority of excreted 
 bexarotene in the faeces after an i.v. dose provided evidence for hepatobiliary excretion of the 
 compound. the metabolism and excretion data indicated that the hepatobiliary excretion and 
 subsequent faecal elimination of glucuronide conjugates (or parent compound in the dog) constitute 
 the primary and almost exclusive means of bexarotene elimination in the rat and dog. 
 8</p></section><section><header>enzyme induction</header><p>a rat study revealed that 4 days of daily, oral bexarotene treatment (600 mg/m2) significantly increased (by 91%) gross hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450. levels of some specific cytochrome 
 p450 isozymes decreased significantly (90% for cyp1a2 and 41% for cyp2c11) while others 
 increased significantly (cyp2b1/b2 by 28-fold, cyp3a by 8.2-fold and cyp4a by 71-fold). rates of 
 cytochrome p450 and glucuronyltransferase-mediated bexarotene metabolism were increased 
 significantly in these microsomal preparations (by 252% and 77%, respectively), further supporting 
 metabolic induction by bexarotene as a potential mechanism contributing to the reduction of systemic 
 exposure after repeated dosing.</p></section><section><header>other studies</header><p>pharmacokinetic data were collected during two repeated dose pharmacodynamic studies of bexarotene in rats. systemic drug exposure was dose-dependent and lower than dose-proportional in 
 both studies.</p></section><section><header>transferability across the placenta and distribution into milk</header><p>studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures to bexarotene, a margin of safety for human teratogenicity has not been demonstrated. 
 bexarotene is contraindicated in pregnancy. 
 it is not known whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk.</p><p>bexarotene should not be used in 
 breast-feeding mothers. this information has been included in the spc (see section 4.6 
 pregnancy and lactation).</p></section><section><header>systemic exposure in animals compared to patients</header><p>cmax and auc increase proportionally to the dose in dog and in rat at the lower doses, and less than proportionally at higher doses. plasma concentrations depend on dose, formulation and duration of 
 treatment. consequently, the exposure must be estimated by measured concentrations (auc)</p><p>table 1: systemic exposure in preclinical and clinical studies</p></section><section><header>species rat n = 10/sex

 administration to 2 dogs/sex/group at 0 or 720 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose in this species) elicited 
 transient decreases in body weight and in serum cholesterol, ldl and hdl. there were no treatment-
 related findings at gross pathology. pharmacokinetic analyses at fixed intervals post-dose revealed 
 mean bexarotene c
 max and auc values of up to 60,800 ng/ml and 565,000 ng.h/ml respectively. on a auc basis the systemic exposure was 112 (males) to 148 (females) times higher than that in patients 
 at the recommended initial human dose (auc of 3797 ng.h/ml after 300 mg/m
 2/day multiple dose). 9</p></section><section><header>repeated dose toxicity</header><p>repeat dose toxicity studies (according to glp) consisted of oral dose studies of approximately 4 week, 3 months and 6 months duration in the rat and dog (with 28 day recovery periods). 
 the main adverse treatment related findings were: 
 - 
 mortality related to serious coagulopathy in rats 
 - 
 hepatic toxicity in rats and dogs 
 - 
 cataracts in rats and dogs 
 - 
 adrenal gland hypertrophy in rats and dogs 
 - 
 testicular degeneration in dogs.</p><p>
 other adverse treatment related findings were: 
 - 
 adverse local tolerance effects in the rat 
 - 
 effects on haematology parameters in rats and dogs 
 - 
 effects on haematopoietic tissues in the dog</p></section><section><header>mortality related to serious coagulopathy in rats</header><p>in the repeat-dose rat studies, dose-related mortality due to haemorrhage and serious coagulopathy was associated with bexarotene administered at doses &gt; 10 mg/kg/day in sesame oil suspension by gavage 
 or in a diet.</p><p>the coagulopathy was associated with bexarotene-related prolongation of prothrombin 
 (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) (&gt;30 seconds). vitamin k supplementation 
 reduced the coagulopathy.</p><p> 
 in 3-month and 6-month studies in rats in which bexarotene was administered by gavage in a 
 peg/aqueous suspension, haemorrhage due to serious coagulopathy was not observed, despite 
 findings of higher pt and aptt in male rats compared to controls. pt or aptt was not increased in 
 females. deaths in these studies appeared to be related to gavage injury as the major precipitating 
 event possibly related to hyperkeratosis induced in the oesaphagus (see below). 
 in contrast to the rat, no deaths related to serious coagulopathy occurred in the dog studies. therefore 
 this finding appears to be related to the oral administration of sesame oil to rats.</p></section><section><header>liver toxicity in rats and dogs</header><p>reversible hepatomegaly occurred in rats and dogs following repeat dosing with bexarotene. in both species, the liver returned to a normal size by the end of a 28-day treatment-free recovery period. 
 the increase in liver weight was associated with increases in the serum levels of the liver enzymes. in 
 addition hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis, vacuolisation and pigment deposition were present. 
 the effects were reversible following the 28-day treatment-free recovery periods. in the 6-month rat 
 study with a 3-month interim sacrifice up to a 100% increase in liver weight associated with liver 
 hypertrophy was observed at 2 to 3 months. there was no liver hypertrophy at 6 months of treatment, 
 suggesting an adaptation to the drug effects. 
 in the 3-month dog study, no liver weight increases or adverse liver histopathology were observed 
 after 91 days of treatment with nonmicronised bexarotene doses up to 1.5 mg/kg/day. by contrast in 
 the 6-month dog study there were significant increases in relative liver weights associated with liver 
 hypertrophy at 3 or 10 mg/kg/day micronised bexarotene. after a 4-week recovery period, relative 
 liver weights of treated dogs were comparable to controls; however, slight liver hypertrophy was still 
 present in all dogs at the end of recovery.</p><p>no liver effects occurred at 1 mg/kg/day. 
 in conclusion, the adverse treatment related effects on the liver observed in two species appeared to be 
 mainly almost completely reversible upon cessation of treatment.</p></section><section><header>cataracts in rats and dogs</header><p>in the 6-month studies in rats and dogs dose-related posterior subcapsular cataracts developed in both species. 
 cataracts in the rats were more severe and progressive than in dogs. in the 6-month rat study, prior to 
 early sacrifice in week 8 of the 300 mg/kg/day (top) dose group there was a 51% incidence of 
 cataracts. the cataracts increased in severity and incidence during the course of treatment at 3, 30 and 
 100 mg/kg/day and were not reversible upon cessation of treatment. in dogs, cataracts affected only a 
 limited area in the posterior capsule, were bilateral, and appeared non-progressive. in the 26-week 
 10 study, cataract formation occurred after 11 weeks of treatment at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day and the incidence increased .at study termination.</p><p>
 the noel for cataracts in dogs was 1 mg/kg/day and in rats was &lt;30 mg/kg/day. based on auc 
 systemic exposure for doses inducing cataract formation, there does not appear to be a margin of 
 safety relative to human clinical exposure. there was no evidence in either species that the cataracts 
 were reversible upon cessation of treatment. the marketing authorisation holder has not provided a 
 mechanistic explanation for this finding, the aetiology of which is unexplained. although this finding 
 has not been reported in the clinical data, the seriousness and lack of reversibility make this finding a 
 matter of concern..</p></section><section><header>adrenal gland hypertrophy in rats and dogs</header><p>dose-related transient increases in adrenal weights were a common finding, but were reversible upon treatment cessation. this finding is probably not of clinical relevance.</p></section><section><header>testicular degeneration in dogs</header><p>testicular tubular degeneration, reversible after treatment cessation, occurred only in sexually immature dogs (&lt; 5 months) that were treated for up to 3 months with &gt; 0.1 mg/kg/day of bexarotene.

 testicular abnormalities even at higher doses (up to 10 mg/kg). this finding is probably not of clinical 
 relevance.</p></section><section><header>adverse local tolerance effects in the rat</header><p>acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the epithelium in the non-glandular stomach and acanthosis of the skin occurred at &gt; 30 mg/kg/day in the rat 6-month study. this finding was reversible upon cessation

 mg/kg/day p.o.) were conducted to evaluate the potential for developmental toxicity of bexarotene in 
 rats. these studies demonstrated that bexarotene, in common with the majority of retinoids, was both 
 teratogenic and embryotoxic in oral-dose studies at systemic exposures achieved clinically in patients. 
 the teratogenic effects</p><p>of retinoids are well documented therefore it was not considered necessary to 
 conduct further studies. 
 bexarotene is contraindicated both in pregnancy and during lactation. advice is given that women of 
 child-bearing potential should employ adequate birth control measures (see section 4.6 
 pregnancy and lactation
 ). 11</p></section><section><header>local tolerance</header><p>in support of the parallel clinical development of bexarotene gel as a topical product, the local tolerance of bexarotene was investigated. 
 dermal toxicity assessed in a 28 day study in the rat at gel strengths of 0.01%, 0.1% or 1.0% w/w 
 revealed time and dose-related increased incidence and severity of erythema (slight to mild), 
 epidermal scaling, scabbing and thickening, confined to the site of administration. 
 bexarotene topical gel at &lt; 1.0% w/w did not appear to be a skin sensitiser in the guinea pig. 
 treatment related reactions appeared to be dermal irritation, possibly associated with some component 
 of the vehicle, based on the similarity of reaction in vehicle and test article formulations.</p></section><section><header>ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>the marketing authorisation holder states that bexarotene will not be manufactured in the e.u. the expected patient numbers in the e.u. is not anticipated to exceed 1200 patients/annum, therefore it is a 
 low volume compound. its therapeutic use is not considered to have an immediate effect on the 
 environment.</p></section><section><header>other toxicity studies</header><p>high concentrations of bexarotene appear to have a weak potential to be phototoxic and photo-irritating as determined by 
 in vitro haemoglobin oxidation and histidine assays respectively. bexarotene was not photocytotoxic in a human skin model of normal epidermal keratinocytes. a 
 protein photo-binding assay in human serum albumin showed that bexarotene is capable of photo-
 induced binding and therefore may be a potential photoallergen.</p></section><section><header>discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects</header><p>bexarotene is a new synthetic retinoid that binds selectively to three rxr receptors. the link between bexarotene-mediated rxr signalling and the effect in ctcl has not been precisely established. the 
 retinoids, including rxr-selective ligands, can modulate t-cell biology, which can have relevance for 
 a possible mechanism of action of bexarotene in ctcl.</p><p>
 bexarotene formulations used in preclinical studies have changed during development. suspensions of 
 nonmicronised bexarotene in sesame oil (rats) and babassu oil (dogs) were used in preliminary studies. 
 these suspensions were replaced by suspensions in polyethylene glycol 400 (peg) and nonmicronised 
 bexarotene was replaced with micronised bexarotene, used in the pivotal 26-week dog and rat studies. 
 bexarotene was bioavailable following oral administration in both test species. systemic exposure was 
 decreased upon repeat dosing, which could be attributed to metabolic enzyme induction. 
 interaction studies were not performed, as reflected in the spc. these studies will be performed as a 
 post-marketing commitment.</p><p>
 in repeated dose-toxicity studies conducted in rats and in dogs, the target organs of bexarotene were 
 eyes (cataractogenic in both rats and dogs with no signs of recovery after 28 days), liver (weight 
 increase, hypertrophy, biliary stasis in dogs, glycogen deposition in rats, slight necrosis in both 
 species), adrenals (weight increase, some vacuolisation of cortical cells) and haematological 
 parameters (reduction in rbc count, increase in platelet count, prolongation of pt and aptt in rats). 
 in rats, bexarotene induced hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the oesophagus and the non-glandular 
 stomach and follicular atrophy and acanthosis of the skin.</p><p>
 mortality was observed in both species. hyperkeratosis of the oesophagus was probably the cause of 
 gavage-related injury leading to an increase of the mortality in treated rats; however, the cause of 
 death was not clearly established in treated dogs. 
 bexarotene was cataractogenic at dosages comparable to human exposition. the marketing 
 authorisation holder partially addressed the mechanism of cataract formation in animal studies. 
 however, the relevance of animal findings to the human situation is still not clear. moreover, the 
 clinical follow-up of patients was not long enough to exclude a cataractogenic effect of bexarotene 
 treatment. this effect will be closely monitored by the marketing authorisation holder. 
 bexarotene is teratogenic and embryotoxic at dosages comparable to human exposure. fertility and 
 peri- and post-natal effects of bexarotene were not evaluated. the use of bexarotene has to be 
 contraindicated during pregnancy. adequate birth-control measures have to be employed by women of 
 childbearing potential.</p><p>
 12 bexarotene is not mutagenic. carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.</p></section><section><header>part iv: clinical aspects introduction</header><p>the clinical trials were performed according to gcp standards and agreed ethical principles.</p></section><section><header>clinical pharmacology</header><p>a total of three dose-ranging phase i-ii involving 141 cancer patients were conducted. see table 2.</p><p> table 2: dose-ranging studies</p></section><section><header>protocol no.

 there were a further 11 studies where targretin capsules were given to approximately 500 patients 
 with a range of diagnoses from advanced solid tumours, psoriasis and diabetes mellitus. in these 
 studies the doses ranged from 5-1000 mg/m
 2/day.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics mechanism of action</header><p>bexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and activation of the three retinoid x receptors (rxrs): rxr
 α, β, and γ. once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and 
 proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin sensitisation. the ability of the rxrs to form heterodimers with 
 various receptor partners that are important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the 
 biological activities of bexarotene are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the retinoic 
 acid receptors (rars). 
 it is not known if the clinical response is supported only by the rxr activation effect. 
 pharmacokinetic data (plasma levels obtained after targretin administration) and 
 in vitro binding data suggested that a continuous activation of rxr receptors is obtained after the administration of the 
 initial dose of 300 mg/m²/day. additionally a partial activation of rar receptors may also be 
 obtained. 
 the plasma concentrations of targretin observed after repeated dose administration suggested that 
 activation of rxr receptors could be obtained at peak as well as at trough concentrations. 
 rar activation is unlikely to be obtained at trough concentrations. 
 13</p></section><section><header>dose finding studies</header><p>at least three patients at each dose level were evaluated.</p><p>if, after two weeks of treatment, no dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) was observed in the first three patients, then three patients could be entered 
 into the next higher dose level. the mtd was defined as the highest dose level that resulted in no 
 more than one patient experiencing a dlt among at least six patients who had completed at least four 
 weeks of treatment. 
 the studies began with the non-micronised formulation of bexarotene. because of a change in 
 formulation, the micronised formulation of bexarotene was introduced at one-sixth the daily dose of 
 the original non-micronised formulation. the micronised formulation of bexarotene was considered to 
 have 6 to 8 times better oral bioavailability than the non-micronised formulation. 
 there were 9 patients with ctcl enrolled in l1069-93-01 study. two of 9 patients improved while 
 on bexarotene, which provided an early indication of bexarotene in ctcl. these patients responded 
 to low doses of targretin capsules (5 mg/m
 2/day and 20 mg/m2/day of non-micronised formulation). four other ctcl patients treated in the range of 10 to 65 mg/m
 2/day of non-micronised formulation and three patients treated in the range of 230 to 300 mg/m
 2/day of the micronised formulation did not respond. 
 the recommendation regarding bid or qd dosing could not be made based on small number of 
 patients studied at each dosing schedule in l1069-94-02 study.</p><p>the initial starting dose chosen was the mtd determined from study l1069-93-02 (650 mg/m
 2/day). the low dose level in one treatment arm in l1069-23 study (6,5 mg/m
 2/day) was selected to approximate the dose level (adjusted for the micronised formulation) at which responses were 
 observed in l1069-93-01 study.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics introduction</header><p>the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene were evaluated during 6 clinical studies in patients with advanced cancers (3 studies), type ii diabetes mellitus (1 study) and ctcl (2 studies). one study of relative 
 bioavailability of targretin capsules 75 mg and a bexarotene suspension has also been performed in 12 
 healthy volunteers: 
 most patients were males (2/3), with the median age of 60 years. tested treatments were administered 
 concomitantly with food intake after 8-hour diet. the patients were not to have received other drugs 
 susceptible to alter renal or hepatic function. pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m
 2.</p></section><section><header>absorption</header><p>initial data from patients in trial l1069-93-01 and l1069-93-02 showed that the micronised formulation had significantly greater bioavailability than the non-micronised form (n=10) and only the 
 micronised form was used for the rest of the trial. the initial half-life was 1.4 h with no accumulation 
 with multiple daily doses. 
 over the dose range proposed in the spc, the half-life was approximately 2 h and the c
 max and auc increased dose proportionally. absorption was enhanced by about 40% when bexarotene was taken 
 with a fat containing dietary supplement in diabetic patients. 
 bioavailability (c
 max and auc) decrease of targretin after repeated administration is observed only in animal models during preclinical studies and in patients with no ctcl, enrolled in phase i and phase 
 ii studies. this decrease of targretin bioavailability was explained by the existence of an auto-
 induction of targretin metabolism. 
 these findings suggested that auto-induction may alter bioavailability of targretin in patients with 
 ctcl and consequently its clinical effect after repeated dosing. nevertheless, pk studies conducted in 
 patients with ctcl at the recommended doses, shows no alteration of the bioavailability of targretin 
 in this patient group, suggesting that metabolic capacity of patients with ctcl is not altered after 
 reiterated dosing. 
 additionally, clinical experience shows that therapeutic response to bexarotene continued to occur at 
 least up to 26,6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment.</p><p>
 14 a decrease of plasma concentrations depending of the duration of treatment was observed in preclinical studies in rat and dog. these observations were consistent with an auto-induction of 
 bexarotene metabolism. 
 in humans, there was no decrease of plasma concentrations after multiple dosing in patients with 
 ctcl. during phase i-ii studies a reduction of bexarotene concentrations was observed within 15 
 days of dosing. for these patients no further decrease of plasma concentrations was observed after day 
 15. 
 the mechanism causing the lowering of plasma levels after multiple dosing was investigated in animal 
 models (rat hepatic microsomes). an increase cytochrome p450 iso-enzyme was specifically observed 
 with cyp3a4 after repeated administration of bexarotene. 
 in conclusion, a potential of auto-induction of metabolism of targretin exists. but, no consequences of 
 this mechanism have been observed in patients with ctcl at the recommended doses.</p></section><section><header>protein binding</header><p>in study rr-845-99-002 the binding of radio-labelled drug to plasma proteins was high at 99.8-99.9% and was independent of the bexarotene concentration over the range tested.</p></section><section><header>metabolism</header><p>the predominant plasma metabolites are formed by oxidation at the c-6 and c-7 positions to form 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and bexarotene acyl glucuronide. for all metabolites the c-6 isomer 
 predominated over c-7 in humans. 
 in vitro studies suggest that cytochrome p450 3a4 is the major cytochrome p450 isozyme responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites. based on the 
 in vitro</p><p>binding and the retinoid receptor activation profile of the metabolites, and on the relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have little impact on the pharmacological 
 profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.</p></section><section><header>elimination</header><p>there was no detectable difference in clearance with the first dose or multiple doses up to 400 mg/m
 2/day in study l1069-93-01. the elimination half-life was approximately 1-3 hours when determined over a six-hour sampling interval. in some patients with 24-hour post sampling schedules 
 the mean terminal elimination half-life was 7-9 hours. 
 neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. the estimated 
 renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute. faecal excretion was not measured, but it is 
 assumed that elimination of the drug and its metabolites are primarily hepatobiliary.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics in special populations</header><p>no formal studies to assess kinetics in special patient populations have been performed</p><p>use in children and adolescents: targretin should not be used in a paediatric population until further data become available.</p><p>
 use in the elderly: of the total number of patients with ctcl in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years or older, while 30% were 70 years or older.</p><p>no overall differences in safety were observed between 
 patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to 
 targretin capsules cannot be ruled out.</p><p>the standard dose should be used in the elderly.</p><p>renal insufficiency: no formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency. clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a 
 minor excretory pathway for bexarotene. in all evaluated patients, the estimated renal clearance of 
 bexarotene was less than 1 ml/minute.</p><p>in view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency 
 should be monitored carefully while on targretin capsule therapy.</p><p>hepatic insufficiency: no formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>clinical and animal pharmacokinetic data suggest that bexarotene is eliminated through hepatobiliary 
 mechanisms.</p><p>although there was no evidence for altered bexarotene pharmacokinetics in patients 
 with elevated serum bilirubin, sgpt/alt, sgot/ast, or alkaline phosphatase, patients with hepatic 
 insufficiency may theoretically have altered bexarotene pharmacokinetics. therefore, patients with 
 hepatic insufficiency should be monitored carefully while on targretin capsule therapy. 
 sex and ethnic origin: no relationship in the kinetics between sex or ethnic origin was studied.</p><p>
 15</p></section><section><header>interaction studies</header><p>the data are limited. therefore the marketing authorisation holder has agreed to perform further interaction studies (see section ii.3, 
 follow-up measures of the marketing authorisation holder). drug interactions: effects of other substances on bexarotene: no formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of 
 bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4 (cyp3a4), co-administration with other cyp substrates such as 
 ketoconazole, itraconazole, protease inhibitors, clarithromycin and erythromycin may theoretically 
 lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. furthermore, co-administration with 
 cyp3a4 inducers, such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or phenobarbital may theoretically 
 cause a reduction in plasma bexarotene concentrations. 
 a population analysis of plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with ctcl indicated that 
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of 
 bexarotene. the mechanism of this interaction is unknown.</p><p>
 there are some retrospective data on kinetics from study l1069-23 for patients taking levothyroxine, 
 atorvastatin and gemfibrozil. bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant 
 administration of atorvastatin or levothyroxine. concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with 
 targretin capsules is not recommended. 
 drug interactions: effects of bexarotene on other substances: there are indication that bexarotene may induce cyp3a4. therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-induction of 
 its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels greater than 300 mg/m
 2/day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome p450 
 3a4. for example bexarotene may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.</p><p>
 after the granting of the authorisation of targretin, the mah submitted a variation application on the 
 basis of the interim analysis report of clinical trial l1069-34.</p><p>this is an open-label, multicenter phase 
 ii study for the “evaluation of targretin (bexarotene) capsules in patients with advanced breast 
 cancer” to determine the activity of targretin at two different dose levels in the treatment of women 
 with metastatic breast cancer. secondary objectives included determination of bexarotene 
 pharmacokinetics in women with breast cancer and determination of plasma tamoxifen concentrations 
 in women receiving concomitant targretin capsules and tamoxifen therapy. the mechanism of the 
 observed interaction between bexarotene and tamoxifen is unclear and the clinical significance of the 
 diminution of tamoxifen auc (35%) is not established. the cpmp considered that the most 
 appropriate way to include this information on a possible interaction would be to modify the statement 
 under section 4.5 of the summary of product characteristics: 
 “bexarotene may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome p450 3a4,</p></section><section><header>such as tamoxifen</header><p>.”</p><p> laboratory test interactions: 
 ca125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuated with targretin capsule therapy.</p><p>
 food interactions: in all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take targretin capsules with or immediately following a meal. in one clinical study, plasma bexarotene auc and c
 max values were substantially higher following the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the 
 administration of a glucose solution. because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based 
 upon administration with food, it is recommended that targretin capsules be administered with food.</p><p>
 on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4, grapefruit juice may 
 theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p></section><section><header>bioequivalence studies</header><p>one study of relative bioavailability of targretin capsules 75 mg and a bexarotene suspension has been performed in 12 healthy volunteers. as usual after an oral administration of a retinoid great

 pharmacodynamics section.</p></section><section><header>main studies</header><p>the 2 pivotal phase ii-iii studies, l1069-23 and l1069-24, aimed to be historically controlled studies by a comparison to the natural evolution of patients with untreated refractory ctcl. the studies have 
 followed international conference on harmonisation (ich) for the ethical conduct of clinical trials.</p><p>the principal objectives of both studies were to evaluate the safety and antitumour efficacy of 
 bexarotene in patients with refractory or persistent early stage ctcl and in patients with refractory 
 advanced stage ctcl. study l1069-23 aimed to evaluate two different daily doses of targretin 
 capsules in patients with refractory or persistent early stage ctcl, but was not powered to compare 
 the two response rates.</p><p>
 general description 
 in l1069-23 study patients were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to low dose (6,5 mg/m
 2/day) or to high dose (650 mg/m
 2/day) bexarotene. in l1069-24 study all patients were initially treated by bexarotene 650 mg/m
 2/day. because of a high number of dose-limiting toxicities, the starting dose level was successively reduced in both studies by protocol amendments from 650 mg/m
 2/day to 500 mg/m
 2/day and finally to 300 mg/m2/day.</p><p> 
 in addition, as patients on low dose bexarotene (6.5 mg/m
 2/day) appeared to progress more frequently than those on the higher dose group, the study protocol l1069-23 was amended to stop the inclusions 
 in the low dose group and to include all patients in 300 mg/m
 2/day dose group. by the decision of the fda, the randomisation between the two dose groups and the 6,5 mg/m
 2/day dose group were re-introduced several months later.</p><p>
 the planned treatment duration was at least 16 weeks. the initial daily dose could have been 
 decreased to 200 mg/m
 2/day and than to 100 mg/m2/day or temporarily interrupted (for less than 4 weeks) in case of toxicity. in case of no response after at least 8 weeks of therapy, the dose could have 
 been increased to 400 mg/m
 2/day or more if well tolerated. patients with the initial dose of 6,5 mg/m
 2/day could have their dose increased to 300 mg/m2/day in case of no response after at least 8 weeks of therapy.</p><p>
 inclusion and exclusion criteria</p><p>
 patients were to have met the following: 
 • a clinical diagnosis of ctcl (stage i to iia in l1069-23 study, stage iib to ivb in l1069-24 study) confirmed by a biopsy within 30 days prior to entry 
 • refractory to, or intolerant to, or have reached a response plateau for at least 6 months on at least two prior therapies in study l1069-23 (puva, uvb, electron-beam therapy, photophereses, 
 topical nitrogen mustard, bcnu, interferon, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy). at least one of 
 qualifying prior treatments must have been topical nitrogen mustard, bcnu</p><p>or</p><p>puva, uvb, or 
 electron-beam therapy. previous topical steroids and systemic retinoids did not qualify. 
 19 • refractory to at least one systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy in study l1069-24. • refractory ctcl</p></section><section><header>:</header><p>resistance to therapy due to lack of response of at least 50% improvement or progression on therapy after initial response.</p><p>• intolerant ctcl: discontinuation of therapy due to side effects/toxicity, whether or not a response occurred. 
 • no antipruritic therapy or no change before and during the trial • systemic therapy of ctcl indicated • no topical ctcl treatment within 2 weeks, no puva or uvb within 3 weeks, no ebt, photopheresis, systemic anticancer therapy or oral retinoid therapy for any indication within 4 
 weeks prior to study entry.</p><p>
 • a karnofsky performance score &gt;60 and acceptable organ function (notably normal lipid levels) • negative hcg test and effective means of contraception in female patients of child-bearing potential</p><p>
 the patients were followed up at week 2, week 4 and every 4 weeks during the treatment.</p><p>
 the patients were withdrawn from the study in case of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or 
 other medically important event. the use of topical corticosteroids as a qualifying prior therapy 
 meeting eligibility criteria was excluded in study l1069-23 for the purpose of assuring a more 
 refractory population of patients for these studies. topical steroids are commonly used in the very 
 early stages of ctcl, often during the stages of disease prior to a diagnosis of ctcl. because of the 
 high frequency of use, especially in the earliest stages of ctcl, if topical steroids were allowed as a 
 qualifying therapy the patient population would not have been as heavily treated or as refractory. 
 additionally, as a therapy often administered prior to a diagnosis of ctcl, there might have been 
 some uncertainty about whether the topical steroid should be considered to have been administered for 
 the treatment of ctcl or for some other, pre-ctcl diagnosed condition.</p></section><section><header>efficacy evaluation</header><p>primary efficacy endpoints were defined as the tumour response to treatment (clinical complete response [ccr] + partial response [pr]) determined by: 
 physician’s global assessment of clinical condition (pga) and</p><p>
 composite assessment of index lesion disease severity (ca)</p><p>
 a patient was considered a responder if he met response criteria for either the pga or the ca, which 
 designated the primary endpoint classification (pec) for the study. the highest pec between the 
 pga and ca for each patient was used for response calculation. it is accepted that the primary 
 endpoint classification (pec) is not a standard approach to cancer therapy response rates. no attempt 
 was made to blind investigators performing clinical evaluations. however, the ca endpoint was based 
 entirely on objective assessments of disease status. the ca endpoint was based on the five clinical 
 signs of up to five index lesions representative of the patient’s overall cutaneous disease. precise serial 
 measurements of all cutaneous lesions would not have been feasible. a total of 68% (103/152) of the 
 patients enrolled had at least 20 (or considerably more) cutaneous ctcl lesions at baseline. the exact 
 number of lesions was not recorded on the case report form for these patients; precise and reliable 
 tracking of multiple clinical signs for each of the lesions was considered unwieldy and impractical. 
 the overall body surface area (bsa) involvement by ctcl is an independent and objective secondary 
 efficacy endpoint. these data include all patients. 
 physician’s global assessment (pga
 ) the physician’s global assessment (pga) assessed the overall extent of improvement/worsening of the patient&apos;s overall disease compared to the condition at entry (at baseline), including both index and 
 non-index cutaneous lesions, clinically abnormal lymph nodes, and all other ctcl disease 
 manifestations, if present.</p><p>

 in addition, complete response (cr) was defined by the pga grade 0 and the absence of ctcl on 
 cutaneous biopsy of a clinically cured lesion. 
 an improvement or worsening in the pga grade must have been confirmed by two consecutive 
 observations over at least four weeks. the response to targretin capsule treatment was classified as 
 cr, ccr, pr, sd, or pd (if pd preceded in time a better response the patient would be classified as 
 pd) 
 composite assessment (ca) of index lesion disease severity 
 up to five index lesions per patient were assessed and graded at each visit according on a 0-to-8 point 
 scale (0=no lesion, 8=very severe lesion) with regard to scaling, erythema, plaque elevation, 
 hypo/hyper-pigmentation, and surface area. for scaling, erythema, and hypo/hyperpigmenation 
 intermediate intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 were added to serve as mid-points between the defined grades 0, 2, 
 4, 6 and 8. the surface area in square centimetres (multiplication of 2 longest perpendicular diameters) 
 was converted to a 0-to-18 scale (see appendix) in order to be incorporated to ca grade. 
 summing all the grades for each index lesion generated a ca grade. ca grade at baseline was then 
 divided by ca grades at each subsequent visit to determine the ca ratio. ca ratio 
 &lt;1.0 indicated improvement in disease and a ratio 
 &gt;1.0 indicated a worsening of disease.</p><p> the definite ctcl response to treatment according to the ca endpoint</p><p>was calculated by the 
 marketing authorisation holder:</p><p>
 - 
 complete response (cr): ca ratio=0, no skin lesions, no clinically abnormal lymph nodes or 
 visceral tumours, and a cutaneous biopsy documenting absence of histology signs of ctcl 
 from a cleared lesion</p><p>
 - 
 clinical complete response (ccr): ca ratio=0 and no skin lesions, no clinically abnormal 
 lymph nodes or visceral tumours. 
 - 
 partial response (pr): ca ratio
 ≤0.5 and less than 25% increase in the number or aggregate area of clinically abnormal lymph nodes, cutaneous tumours or visceral disease and no new 
 pathologically abnormal lymph nodes or new visceral disease in an area documented to be free 
 of disease within 14 days of entry in the study 
 - 
 stable disease (sd): if none of the previous response classifications accurately described the 
 disease state, then the primary endpoint classification was sd. 
 - 
 progressive disease (pd): ca ratio 
 ≥1.25, and ≥25% increase in the number or aggregate area of clinically abnormal lymph nodes, cutaneous tumours, known pathologically abnormal lymph 
 nodes or known visceral disease; or a new cutaneous tumour or new pathologically positive 
 lymph node or new visceral disease in an area documented to be free of disease within 14 days 
 of entry in the study</p><p>
 confirmation by at least two assessments separated by at least four study weeks was required for a 
 partial or complete response classification. 
 21</p><p>the physician’s global assessment (pga) gives a global assessment of the improvement/worsening of the patient’s overall disease compared to entry and can always be influenced by knowledge of the 
 daily dose the patients received. the absence of placebo makes this primary endpoint extremely 
 subjective. the composite assessment (ca) of index lesion disease severity is a more objective 
 measure of index lesion response to treatment. however, calculations of both ca grade and ca ratio 
 were done by the marketing authorisation holder. this signifies that the final response to treatment, 
 according to the ca, was assessed by the marketing authorisation holder and not by investigators.</p><p>
 the investigators graded index lesions’ signs and symptoms, and assessed ctcl body surface area 
 (bsa), lymph nodes and visceral involvement. 
 neither total number of skin lesions nor new lesions were assessed. the information concerning these 
 2 points was approximately obtained by bsa of all lesions, (« patient’s palm = 1% of bsa ») and 
 notion « &gt;20 lesions or &lt;20 lesions ».</p><p>
 secondary endpoints</p><p>the most important secondary end-points were: 
 - time to response: a time interval from day 1 to the first confirmed response 
 - duration of disease control: a time interval from first observation when the patient met response 
 criteria (cr, ccr or pr) to the time that the patient relapsed. durability of response: day of relapse 
 (or last data point available for documenting continuation of response) minus day of onset of response, 
 plus one day. a patient was considered to relapse if he first responded to treatment (ccr or pr) and 
 then met the relapse criteria of a 25% or more worsening from the new baseline established at the time 
 of response confirmation. 
 - time to disease progression: a time interval from day 1 to pd 
 - the response (ccr+pr) to treatment of cutaneous disease (all lesions) determined as a percentage 
 involvement of total body surface area (bsa): patient’s palm = 1% of total bsa. bsa was determined 
 for both patch and plaques lesions.</p><p>
 supportive data</p><p>
 index lesion photographs and drug concentration measurements at each visit.</p><p>
 laboratory evaluations</p><p>
 blood specimens were obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks for fasting triglycerides, fasting hdl, 
 ldl and total cholesterol, liver function tests, thyroid hormones, serum amylase, creatine 
 phosphokinase and blood coagulation parameters, complete blood count. the nci common toxicity 
 criteria were used to classify laboratory abnormalities. 
 slit-lamp eye examination every 12 weeks was added by protocol amendment.</p></section><section><header>statistical analysis</header><p>the expected objective response of untreated, refractory ctcl was considered 0%. five percent was used as the theoretical maximum response rate. the success was defined by a ccr+pr 
 ∃20% confirmed by at least 2 assessments separated by 4 weeks (significance level=0,05, historic control 
 response rate=0,05 and alternative (targretin) response rate=0,20). sample size calculations provided 
 that at least 30 patients would be required in each dose group to yield a 95% confidence interval for 
 the true response rate of 5% to 35%. the study l1069-23 in patients with early stage ctcl was not 
 powered to compare the two response rates by inferential statistics.</p><p>
 study design of the study l1069-23 was changed twice: to one dose group with no randomisation and 
 then again to two dose groups.</p><p>
 the definition of “refractory” was prospectively defined before the beginning of the trials. patient 
 enrolment commenced under version 2 of the protocols, which included this definition. a patient who 
 never responded to a given therapy might be characterised as “primarily” refractory to that therapy; a 
 patient who initially responded and then progressed on a given therapy, might be characterised as 
 “secondarily” refractory to that therapy. 
 for the total of 322 refractory prior therapies in both studies, 82% (264/322) were primarily refractory 
 and only 18% (58/322) were secondarily refractory. a new, non-protocol-specified analysis included 
 22 only patients primarily refractory to at least one systemic ctcl therapy. patients secondarily refractory, intolerant, or having had a response plateau to prior therapy were not analysed.</p><p>
 these selection criteria were applied to 193 patients, included in both studies.</p><p>these criteria produced 
 a subset of 117 patients, including 24 patients from the early stage study and 93 patients from the 
 advanced stage study.</p><p>
 although the indication «refractory ctcl» represents a heterogeneous group of t-cell skin 
 malignancies including classic mycosis fungoides and sézary syndrome as the most common forms, 
 this can be accepted.</p><p>
 in the recent period aggressive ctcl forms have become better individualised, and it might be 
 possible nowadays to exclude these patients from enrolment because they need different, frequently 
 more aggressive treatment. however, this distinction was probably impossible when the studies were 
 realised.</p><p>
 in addition it might be impossible to enrol sufficient patients to power a study by individual sub-
 classification variants of ctcl. the incidence of ctcl in europe has been estimated to be about 
 1,200 patients per year.</p><p>the scarcity of clinical subjects has obvious practical implications for the 
 clinical development programme.</p><p>
 descriptions of techniques used</p><p>
 point and interval estimation was the primary method for analysis. summary statistics were provided 
 for continuous variables. frequency distribution and percent were presented for discrete variables.</p><p>
 for the purpose of analysis, patients have been grouped in three initial dose groups: 
 6.5 mg/m
 2/day 300 mg/m

 2/day</p></section><section><header>study populations</header><p>in study l1069-23 the age of the patients ranged from 24-62 years, median 62, 82% were white and 64% male. the majority, 59%, had stage ib disease with only one patient with stage iib who had 20 
 cutaneous tumours. the mean duration of the disease was over 13 years. previous treatments included 
 irradiation 97%, systemic therapy 59%, topical or local therapy 95%. the most common previous 
 systemic therapy was interferon, 38%.</p><p>
 in study l1069-24 patients were 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of stage iib-ivb ctcl

 ctcl patients. of the 93 advanced stage patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment, 61 
 were treated at the recommended posology of a 300 mg/m²/day (32 patients were treated at doses

 the most common therapies to which the patients were refractory were interferon (52% of

 dose modifications: there was no reduction of dose in 54% of patients; 39% of patients required 
 temporary suspension of treatment.</p><p>
 the overall response rates (ccr + pr) were 31% (ca) and 51% (pga). the clinical complete 
 response rates were 6.6% by ca, 3.3% for pga. the projected median time to progression was 16.1 
 weeks for ca. responses were observed across all advanced stages of disease: stage iib: 43% (10/23

 for the 30 patients in the spc data set with at least one pre-existing clinically abnormal lymph node, 
 30% (9 patients) had at least 50% sustained improvement in the number of nodes and/or aggregate 
 nodal area. seven patients had at least transient complete resolution of all lymph nodes.</p><p>
 for the 14 patients in the spc data set with at least one pre-existing cutaneous tumour, 21% (3 
 patients) had at least 50% sustained improvement in the number of tumours and/or aggregate volume

 one patient experienced a 69% reduction in tumour volume.</p><p>
 out of 24 early stage ctcl patients refractory to at least one systemic therapy, 9 were treated with the 
 recommended posology; the response rate for these patients was 67% (6/9 patients).</p><p>
 the responses were observed mostly in patients with stage iib and iva (cutaneous patches, plaques, 
 and tumours, normal or abnormal lymph nodes and no visceral involvement). the most frequently 
 25 given daily dose was 300 mg/m2/day; this dose should be adapted according to its safety profile in each patient.</p><p>secondary end-points the secondary end-points time to relapse and time to progression of non-responders are difficult to interpret because of the relatively small number of patients per ctcl stage
 . only the median bsa involvement (patch + plaque) by ctcl can be taken into account for the efficacy evaluation. 
 treatment with targretin seems to decrease the bsa of ctcl skin lesions with approximately 10% 
 (-9.5% to -16.3%). this response is evaluated in only 50% of patients treated.</p><p>duration of treatment at recommended posology out of 193 patients treated, for 109 patients in the 300 mg/m2/day dose group, the median duration of treatment was 19.7 weeks (range 0.4 to 84.6 weeks) and for 53 patients in the &gt;300 mg/m

 for etretinate 75 mg/day. the average daily dose in the two studies was situated around 200 
 mg/m
 2/day. moreover, no clinical data exist on one versus two daily doses in ctcl patients. however, the dose recommendation can be accepted, provided that this dose is adapted according to 
 the safety profile in each individual patient to obtain the most acceptable benefit/risk ratio. this is 
 reflected in the spc (see section 4.2 
 posology and method of administration). 26</p></section><section><header>efficacy results</header><p>no comparative study was provided. the two pivotal studies were open-label, phase ii-iii studies in patients with early stage ctcl, and in patients with advanced stage ctcl. selected population 
 comprised refractory, resistant or intolerant patients, or patients progressing after initial response to 1 
 or 2 previous treatments. primary efficacy variable was tumour response to treatment, evaluated by 
 one subjective endpoint (physicians global assessment of clinical condition, pga) and by one more 
 objective endpoint (composite assessment of index lesion disease severity, ca). on the

 - other retinoids: cr+pr=58% (cr=19%)</p><p>
 additional analysis of recently published literature revealed 11 monotherapy studies in patients with 
 all clinical stages of ctcl and frequently not refractory to previous treatments: 
 - liposomal doxorubicin: cr+pr=83%, (cr=67%) 
 - interferon : cr+pr=62%, (cr=36%) 
 - trimetrexate: cr+pr=53%, (cr=6%)</p><p>
 comparison to historical controls appears difficult because the patients treated by targretin were 
 refractory to at least one systemic treatment. taking into account that the response rates in the 
 literature were probably evaluated by the endpoints like pga, it can be assumed that the efficacy of 
 targretin (300 mg/m²/day: cr+pr= 31% (ca) or 51% (pga), cr=7%) is comparable to that of 
 interferon and of other retinoids. however, the complete responses to targretin are lower than those 
 observed with other treatments.</p><p>
 within-patient controls 
 the response to targretin was compared to the best response to prior ctcl therapies in 93 advanced 
 stage ctcl patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment. the responses to these prior 
 therapies were assessed by the pga endpoint (subjective investigator’s judgement) in case report 
 forms. 
 the most frequent previous systemic treatments were: 
 - single agent chemotherapy (different agents) (78 patients, cr+pr=14.1%), followed by</p><p>
 - interferon (59 patients, cr+pr=15.3%),</p><p>
 - combination chemotherapy (different regimens)(49 patients, cr+pr=36.7%) and</p><p>
 - other retinoids (29 patients, cr+pr=17.2%).</p><p>
 the overall response rate to targretin was better than the response rates to all previous systemic 
 therapies. the complete response to targretin was lower than that obtained by other retinoids and 
 combination chemotherapy.</p><p>the marketing authorisation holder has provided data on the patients’ response to prior topical and 
 irradiation ctcl therapies (within-patient controls). 
 27 for prior topical therapies the overall response rates to targretin exceeded the response rates to all prior topical therapies except topical retinoids (3 patients).</p><p>
 for prior irradiation therapies: overall response rates to targretin (31%) was exceeded by the response 
 rate for electron beam therapy (72%) and radiotherapy (38%). the response rate to targretin was 
 superior to those for photopheresis (30%) and puva (24%). the low response rates to topical therapy 
 and puva therapy is understandable due to advanced stage and refractory character of the disease.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety patient exposure</header><p>safety data have been reported from 2 phase ii-iii clinical studies of 152 ctcl patients and from 9 open phase i-ii, ii and ii-iii clinical studies with 352 non-ctcl patients.</p><p>
 safety data for 109 ctcl patients treated at the recommended posology have been analysed, based on 
 a duration of exposure with a median of 19.7 weeks (range 3 days to 84.6 weeks).</p><p>
 a total of 47% (91/193) of all enrolled ctcl patients received at least 24 weeks of targretin capsule 
 therapy. these 91 patients were treated for a median of 308 days (mean 344 days, range 172 to 826 
 days). 49/91 patients were treated at the recommended posology. comparison of the safety profile for 
 these 49 patients to the safety profile for all patients at the recommended posology regardless of 
 treatment duration shows that many events are modestly higher for patients treated more than 24 
 weeks. 
 the four-month safety update data, based on 810 patients treated with targretin capsules entered 
 into ligand’s database as of 30 july 1999, further confirm that targretin capsules were generally 
 acceptably tolerated.</p></section><section><header>adverse events and serious adverse event/deaths</header><p>adverse events by system and frequency are listed in table 19.</p></section><section><header>table 9: summary of adverse events patients experiencing

 hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, was the most common adverse event reported in 
 association with targretin capsule therapy. for the 84 ctcl patients in the 300 mg/m2/day initial 
 dose group in the maa submission database, 79% of patients had at least one reported adverse event 
 of hyperlipemia. the severity of hypertriglyceridemia was reduced as the studies progressed and there 
 were no subsequent episodes of pancreatitis following the institution of protocol amendments reducing 
 the initial dose level for the higher dose treatment arm and instituting strict guidelines for the 
 monitoring and management of hyperlipidemia to reduce the risk of additional cases of pancreatitis.</p><p> 
 the modifications of dose regimen and the monitoring and management guidelines that effected this 
 improvement in triglyceride levels in the clinical trials are reflected in the guidelines proposed in the 
 spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use).</p><p>
 the hypothyroidism related to targretin therapy was easily detected and managed, generally mildly 
 symptomatic until treated, promptly reversible with discontinuation of targretin capsule therapy, and 
 was not associated with clinical sequelae. recommendations for the monitoring of thyroid function 
 have been included in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use). 29</p><p>the mechanism for diarrhoea observed in the clinical trials of targretin is unknown.</p><p>the incidence of drug-related diarrhoea was low and was directly related to initial dose level, but did not appear to 
 increase substantially until the dose level exceeded the recommended posology of 300 mg/m2/day. 
 most adverse events of diarrhoea were only mild to moderate in severity. only 0.7% (1/152) of ctcl 
 patients withdrew from the studies for a primary reason of an adverse event of drug-related diarrhoea. 
 dlts of diarrhoea were uncommon, dose-related, did not appear to recur after downward dose 
 adjustments, and rarely caused withdrawal from study. diarrhoea was reported as a dlt in 1.2% 
 (1/84) of patients in the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group. no ctcl patient treated at the 
 recommended posology experienced a serious adverse event of diarrhoea.</p><p>
 diarrhoea has been reported as an adverse event in studies of other retinoids, including tretinoin and 
 etretinate.</p><p> mortality from serious coagulopathy was noted in preclinical studies with an oil-based formulation. 
 dose-limiting toxicities consisting of haemorrhage or events associated with coagulation parameter 
 alterations were rare (2.0%) in ctcl patients and occurred only in the &gt;300 mg/m2/day initial dose 
 group. serious adverse events of this nature were rare (2.0%) in ctcl patients and each was judged 
 to be not related to targretin capsule therapy either by the investigator or upon independent expert 
 review. determination of haemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month 
 and then monthly thereafter. decreases of haemoglobin should be managed according to current 
 medical practice. this has been reflected in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use
 ).</p></section><section><header>serious adverse advents</header><p>among all ctcl patients included in the safety update fatal serious adverse events judged to be at least possibly related to study drug were reported in 6.7% (13/193) of patients with ctcl. the only 
 serious adverse events judged related to study drug that occurred in more than one ctcl patient were 
 pancreatitis, pruritus, and pain. 
 in the main clinical trials serious adverse events considered to be drug related, or possibly related, 
 occurred in 9/152 (6%) of patients with pancreatitis occurring in four patients in association with 
 elevated plasma triglycerides. pancreatitis was the main serious adverse event related to hyperlipemia. 
 there were no further events of pancreatitis subsequent to the guidelines for the monitoring and 
 management of hyperlipemia, a period of over 12 months. these guidelines are included in the spc 
 (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use).</p><p>other serious adverse events included cholestatic jaundice and bilirubinaemia. adverse events and 
 laboratory abnormalities related to the liver were not common and were nearly exclusively mild to 
 moderate in severity in the studies of targretin capsules in ctcl. perhaps the best indication of the 
 level of clinical significance of liver function test abnormalities for patients in the 300 mg/m²/day 
 initial dose group was that there was only one patient (1.2%) withdrawn primarily for liver toxicity 
 (hyperbilirubinemia), and there were no dose-limiting liver toxicities. however, recommendations for 
 the monitoring of hepatic function have been included in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use
 ). also seen were diarrhoea, dehydration, herpes zoster, fever, pruritis and chest pain. seven of the nine 
 patients recovered. one patient died. a second died from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after 
 developing cholestatic jaundice and pancreatitis at which time bexarotene was stopped. for this 
 second patient the fatal event was not considered related to the study drug by the investigator. it is not 
 possible to detect from the history given as to whether drug induced leucopenia contributed to this 
 death, but this seems unlikely as death occurred 80 days after discontinuation of bexarotene. 
 because of preclinical findings of posterior subcapsular cataracts in rats and dogs, slit-lamp 
 examinations were added to the trial protocols after they started. a high prevalence was noted in the 
 limited pre-study data of 66% for ctcl patients and 58% for non-ctcl patients and the incidence of 
 new cataract formation was 5.2%. given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in 
 the older patient population represented in the clinical studies, there was no apparent association 
 between the incidence of lens opacity formation and targretin capsule administration in the clinical 
 studies. however, an effect of long-term bexarotene treatment on cataract formation has not been 
 excluded and this has been reflected in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use
 ). the marketing authorisation holder has agreed to closely monitor the occurrence of cataract formation, particularly during long term treatment. 
 30 retinoids may cause other types of visual impairment than cataract. it is unknown at this time the degree to which these visual abnormalities may be attributable and selective to rar binding effects. 
 the marketing authorisation holder has committed to closely monitor visual abnormalities. in the 
 non-ctcl oncology patients serious adverse events occurred in 11/352 (3.1%) of the patients. 
 pancreatitis occurred in three, hypercalcaemia, pneumonia, and dehydration occurred in two patients 
 each. other serious adverse events were fever, mucous membrane disorder, diarrhoea, melaena, 
 vomiting, anaemia, increased coagulation time, dyspnoea, confusion, conjunctivitis and haematuria.</p></section><section><header>deaths</header><p>in study l1069-24 the median duration of time in the study was seven months with a further median five months follow up during which there were 17 deaths in the 107 patients (94 in the original 
 database and a further 13 enrolled after the database cut off). sixteen of the deaths were considered not 
 related or probably not related by the investigator to bexarotene. one death from bleeding, 
 haemorrhage, coagulopathy and liver failure was considered possibly related. 
 there were only three deaths among ctcl patients subsequent to the iss and all were judged to be 
 not related to study medication by the investigator. 
 in the non-ctcl oncology patients two deaths in the 352 patients receiving bexarotene monotherapy 
 were considered treatment related. one patient had a prolonged prothrombin time and died of a 
 subdural haematoma. the second patient died of acute pancreatitis associated with elevated 
 triglycerides and continued alcohol abuse.</p></section><section><header>discontinuation due to adverse events</header><p>adverse events leading to dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipidaemia, neutropenia/leucopenia, diarrhoea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver 
 function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anaemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, 
 pneumonia and confusion.</p></section><section><header>laboratory findings</header><p>in the main efficacy trial, study l1069-24, there was a marked fall in tsh concentrations from a median of 1.60 
 µu/ml (n=85) at baseline to 0.16 µu/ml at 2-4 weeks (n=39) and 0.37 µu/ml at 12-16 weeks (n=27). changes in total thyroxine paralleled those of tsh. in the same study there were 
 altered lipid, hepatic and haematology parameters. abnormalities in aspartate transaminase, with a 
 increase from normal to above the normal range, occurred in 21% of patients at 2-4 weeks in the 300 
 mg/m
 2/day group and 19% in the &gt;300 mg/m2/day. triglyceride concentrations became elevated or worsened in 64% of patients (n=94), 28 with concentrations 2.5-5 times the upper limit of normal, 23 
 with 5-10 times, and nine with &gt;10 times the upper limit. cholesterol concentrations became elevated 
 or worsened with treatment in 48% of patients, with 21 in the range 7.8-10.3 mmol/l, 14 in the range 
 10.3-12.9 mmol/l and 13 above 12.9 mmol/l. leucopenia was common with 30% having a decrease in 
 total leucocyte count and 35% a decrease in neutrophil count to below the normal range by week 4 of 
 treatment. this effect on the white count persisted with treatment. there was also a fall in median 
 haemoglobin from 13.2 g/dl at baseline to 12.1 g/dl at 12-16 weeks.</p><p>
 the most common laboratory toxicities (hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism and, less frequently, 
 leucopenia) were often asymptomatic, easily monitored and managed with well-tolerated concomitant 
 medications, rarely required treatment discontinuation, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, and 
 resulted in no clinical sequelae except for pancreatitis (and all four ctcl patients with pancreatitis 
 recovered). only 2.4% (2/84) of patients at the 300 mg/m²/day initial dose group required targretin 
 capsules treatment discontinuation because of hypertriglyceridemia, and no patients at this dose 
 required withdrawal from study for a primary reason of hypothyroidism or leucopenia.</p></section><section><header>safety in special populations</header><p>patients with diabetes mellitus caution should be exercised when administering targretin capsules in patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones). based 
 on the known mechanism of action,</p><p>targretin capsules may potentially</p><p>enhance the action of these 
 31 agents, resulting in hypoglycaemia. no cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of targretin capsules as monotherapy have been reported. 
 other special populations no specific information is available.</p><p>the clinical safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in the paediatric population (below 18 years of age) 
 have not been studied and this product should not be used in a paediatric population until further data 
 become available.</p><p>
 in view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored carefully while on 
 targretin capsule therapy. as patients with hepatic insufficiency may theoretically have altered 
 bexarotene pharmacokinetics, they should be monitored carefully while on targretin capsule therapy</p></section><section><header>discussion on clinical safety</header><p>in the initial submission, the safety data were presented from 2 ctcl studies (152 patients) and from 9 non-ctcl studies (352 patients). only 84 ctcl patients and 56 non-ctcl patients were treated 
 with the proposed posology (300 mg/m
 2/day).</p><p>later on in the procedure the marketing authorisation holder submitted the safety data collected from 
 2 ctcl studies (193 patients) and from 9 non-ctcl studies (420 patients); 109 ctcl patients and 
 57 non-ctcl patients were treated by the recommended posology (300 mg/m
 2/day). targretin safety profile appears comparable to that of other retinoid drugs, except for leucopenia and 
 hypothyroidism (specific rxr- related effect of targretin).</p><p>97.4% of ctcl patients, and 84.8% of 
 non-ctcl patients experienced drug-related adverse events. the most frequent ones in ctcl patients 
 were hyperlipemia (73%), hypercholesterolemia (37%), hypothyroidism (35%), exfoliative dermatitis 
 + rash (34%), asthenia (28%), leucopenia (28%), headache (26%) and diarrhoea (12%). the majority 
 of these events were dose and duration dependent, requiring a close monitoring during treatment, dose 
 adaptations and/or specific treatment (antilipemic therapy, thyroid hormones replacement). 6.7% of 
 ctcl and 3.1% non-ctcl patients had drug-related serious adverse events. the most frequent drug-
 related serious adverse events was</p><p>pancreatitis, secondary to hypertriglyceridemia (12/613 cases); all 
 patients recovered except one who died. there were no further event of pancreatitis subsequent to the 
 introduction of guidelines for the monitoring and management of hyperlipemia.</p><p>
 whilst the most common toxicities associated with targretin capsule therapy in patients with ctcl 
 (i.e., hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, and less frequently, neutropenia) often warranted 
 concurrent pharmacological intervention, the required concomitant therapies were easily administered 
 and monitored.</p><p>these toxicities were reversible upon targretin capsule dose reduction, suspension or 
 discontinuation. guidance for managing these adverse events is provided in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use). because of dose-related posterior subcapsular cataracts in rats and dogs, slit-lamp examinations were 
 added to the clinical trial protocols after they started. a high prevalence of cataracts was noted in the 
 limited pre-study data of 66% ctcl and 58% non-ctcl patients and the incidence of new cataract 
 formation was 5.7%. however the follow-up was too short and an effect of long-term bexarotene 
 treatment on cataract formation has not been excluded and will be closely monitored by the marketing 
 authorisation holder. a close monitoring of liver function tests, white blood cells, lipids, thyroid 
 hormones level is recommended in the spc (see section 4.4 
 special warnings and special precautions for use)
 . the safety data of long term treatment (&gt; 24 weeks) reveals no new or substantially different safety 
 issues. 
 except for hyperlipidemia, adverse events were rarely dose-limiting for patients treated at the 
 recommended posology. for the 84 patients in this initial dose group in the maa database, 
 hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia was dose-limiting for 39% (33/84) patients and 
 neutropenia/leucopenia was dose-limiting for 3.6% (3/84) of patients. no other single toxicity was 
 dose-limiting for more than two patients (2.4%). 
 targretin capsule therapy at the recommended posology for patients with ctcl carries substantially 
 less mucocutaneous and nail toxicity and less alopecia than other non-rxr-selective retinoids.</p><p>
 targretin capsules may also cause less myalgias and arthralgias. lipid elevations are observed with 
 both rar and rxr-selective retinoids. central hypothyroidism and, to a lesser extent, leucopenia 
 were reported only for targretin capsules and appear to be rxr-related effects.</p><p>
 32 in conclusion, the safety profile of targretin is close to other retinoids, except for leucopenia and hypothyroidism. the most common treatment-related adverse events were duration dependent.</p></section><section><header>overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment quality</header><p>the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the spc. physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
 performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
 information has been provided in the dossier demonstrating that the medicinal product is made in 
 compliance with the cpmp note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal 
 spongiform encephalopathy agents via medicinal products.</p></section><section><header>pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>bexarotene is a new synthetic retinoid that binds selectively to three rxr receptors. overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that retinoids, including rxr-selective 
 ligands, can modulate t-cell biology, which can have relevance for a possible mechanism of action of 
 bexarotene in ctcl.</p><p>
 bexarotene was bioavailable following oral administration in both test species. systemic exposure was 
 decreased upon repeat dosing, which could be attributed to metabolic enzyme induction. 
 in repeated dose-toxicity studies conducted in rats and in dogs, the target organs of bexarotene were 
 eyes, liver, adrenals and haematological parameters. in rats, bexarotene induced hyperkeratosis and 
 acanthosis of the oesophagus and the non-glandular stomach and follicular atrophy and acanthosis of 
 the skin.</p><p>
 mortality was observed in both species. hyperkeratosis of the oesophagus was probably the cause of 
 gavage-related injury leading to an increase of the mortality in treated rats; however, the mechanism of 
 death was not clearly elucidated in treated dogs.</p><p>
 bexarotene was cataractogenic at dosages comparable to human exposition. this effect will be closely 
 monitored by the marketing authorisation holder</p><p>
 bexarotene is teratogenic and embryotoxic at dosages comparable to human exposition. fertility and 
 peri- and post-natal effects of bexarotene were not evaluated. the use of bexarotene has to be 
 contraindicated during pregnancy. adequate birth-control measures have to be employed by women of 
 childbearing potential.</p><p>
 bexarotene is not mutagenic. carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>the final recommended dose (300 mg/m2/day or 516 mg/day) was empirically decided, by decreasing the initial high dose due to toxicity. this dose still seems too high compared to other known retinoids. 
 however, the dose recommendation can be accepted, provided that this dose is adapted according to 
 the safety profile in each individual patient to obtain the most acceptable benefit/risk ratio.</p><p>
 no comparative study was provided. the two pivotal studies were open-label, phase ii-iii studies in 
 patients with early stage ctcl, and in patients with advanced stage ctcl. selected population 
 comprised refractory, resistant or intolerant patients, or patients progressing after initial response to 1 
 or 2 previous treatments. primary efficacy variable was tumour response to treatment, evaluated by 
 one subjective endpoint (physicians global assessment of clinical condition, pga) and by one more 
 objective endpoint (composite assessment of index lesion disease severity, ca).</p><p>
 the marketing authorisation holder has analysed 193 patients included in both studies; 117 patients 
 refractory to at least 1 systemic treatment were analysed, 24 early stage and 93 advanced stage ctcl 
 patients. the objective response rate in these patients (ca) was 34%.</p><p>
 33 it can be assumed that the efficacy of targretin is comparable to that of interferon and of other retinoids in the studied population of patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment. however, 
 the complete responses to targretin are lower than those observed with other treatments.</p><p>
 for prior irradiation therapies: overall response rates to targretin (31%) was lower than the response 
 rate for electron beam therapy (72%) and radiotherapy (38%). the response rate to targretin was 
 superior to those for photopheresis (30%) and puva (24%).</p><p>
 no formal studies to investigate the effects of other substances on bexarotene have been conducted. 
 there are indications that bexarotene may induce cyp3a4. therefore, repeated administration of 
 bexarotene may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances 
 metabolised by cytochrome p450 3a4.</p><p>
 there were no formal studies in special patient populations.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>whilst the most common toxicities associated with targretin capsule therapy in patients with ctcl (i.e., hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, and less frequently, neutropenia) often warranted
