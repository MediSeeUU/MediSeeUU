 dose modification guidelines: the 300 mg/m2/day dose level may be adjusted to 200 mg/m2/day then to 100 mg/m
 2/day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity.</p><p>when toxicity is controlled, doses may be carefully readjusted upward.</p><p>with appropriate clinical monitoring, individual patients 
 may benefit from doses above 300 mg/m
 2/day.</p><p>doses greater than 650 mg/m2/day have not been</p><p>3evaluated in patients with ctcl. in clinical trials, bexarotene was administered for up to 118 weeks to patients with ctcl. treatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.</p><p>
 paediatric population: the safety and efficacy of bexarotene in children (aged below 18 years) have not been established.</p><p>no data are available.</p><p> 
 elderly patients: of the total number of patients with ctcl in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years or older, while 30% were 70 years or older.</p><p>no overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or 
 older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be 
 ruled out.</p><p>the standard dose should be used in the elderly.</p><p> patients with renal impairment: no formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency. clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a minor excretory pathway 
 for bexarotene. in all evaluated patients, the estimated renal clearance of bexarotene was less than 
 1 ml/minute. in view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored 
 carefully while on bexarotene therapy.</p><p>

 should not donate blood for transfusion. butylated hydroxyanisole, an ingredient in targretin, may 
 cause irritation to the mucous membranes, therefore the capsules must be swallowed intact and not 
 chewed.</p><p>lipids: hyperlipidaemia has been identified as an effect associated with the use of bexarotene in clinical studies.</p><p>fasting blood lipid determinations (triglycerides and cholesterol) should be 
 performed before bexarotene therapy is initiated and at weekly intervals</p><p>until the lipid response to 
 bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and then at intervals no less 
 than monthly thereafter.</p><p>fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalised with appropriate 
 intervention prior to bexarotene therapy.</p><p>every attempt should be made to maintain triglyceride levels 
 below 4.52 mmol/l in order to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae. if fasting triglycerides are elevated 
 or become elevated during treatment, institution of antilipaemic therapy is recommended, and if 
 necessary,</p><p>dose reductions (from 300 mg/m
 2/day of bexarotene to 200 mg/m2/day, and if necessary to</p><p>4100 mg/m2/day) or treatment discontinuation.</p><p>data from clinical studies indicate that bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin. however, concomitant 
 administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene 
 and therefore, concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended (see 
 section 4.5). elevations of serum cholesterol should be managed according to current medical practice.</p><p> pancreatitis: acute pancreatitis associated with elevations of fasting serum triglycerides has been reported in clinical studies. patients with ctcl having risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior episodes 
 of pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes 
 mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated 
 with pancreatic toxicity) should not be treated with bexarotene, unless the potential benefit outweighs 
 the risk.</p><p>
 liver function test (lft) abnormalities: lft elevations associated with the use of bexarotene have been reported.</p><p>based on data from ongoing clinical trials, elevation of lfts resolved within one 
 month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. baseline lfts 
 should be obtained, and lfts should be carefully monitored weekly during the first month and then 
 monthly thereafter.</p><p>consideration should be given to a suspension or discontinuation of bexarotene if 
 test results reach greater than three times the upper limit of normal values for sgot/ast, 
 sgpt/alt, or bilirubin.</p><p>
 thyroid function test alterations: changes in thyroid function tests have been observed in patients receiving bexarotene, most often noted as a reversible reduction in thyroid hormone (total thyroxine 
 [total t
 4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels.</p><p>baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored at least monthly during treatment and as indicated by the emergence of 
 symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism.</p><p>patients with symptomatic hypothyroidism on bexarotene 
 therapy have been treated with thyroid hormone supplements with resolution of symptoms.</p><p>
 leucopenia: leucopenia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. the majority of cases resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>determination of 
 white blood cell count with differential count should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first 
 month and then monthly thereafter.</p><p>
 anaemia: anaemia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. determination of haemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then 
 monthly thereafter. decreases of haemoglobin should be managed according to current medical 
 practice.</p><p>
 lens opacities: following bexarotene 
 treatment, some patients were observed to have previously 
 undetected lens opacities or a change in pre-existing lens opacities unrelated to treatment duration or 
 dose level of exposure. given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in the older 
 patient population represented in the clinical studies, there was no apparent association between the 
 incidence of lens opacity formation and bexarotene administration. however, an adverse effect of 
 long-term bexarotene treatment on lens opacity formation in humans has not been excluded. any 
 patient treated with bexarotene who experiences visual difficulties should have an appropriate 
 ophthalmologic examination.</p><p>
 vitamin a supplementation: because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin a, patients should be advised to limit vitamin a supplements to 
 15,000 iu/day to avoid potential additive toxic effects.</p><p> 
 patients with diabetes mellitus: caution should be exercised when administering bexarotene in patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. 
 thiazolidinediones).</p><p>based on the known mechanism of action,</p><p>bexarotene may potentially</p><p>enhance 
 the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycaemia.</p><p>no cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the 
 use of bexarotene as monotherapy have been reported.</p><p>5photosensitivity: the use of some retinoids has been associated with photosensitivity.</p><p>patients should be advised to minimise exposure to sunlight and avoid sun lamps during therapy with bexarotene, as 
 in vitro</p><p>data indicate that bexarotene may potentially have a photosensitising effect.</p><p> 
 oral contraceptives: bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of oestroprogestive contraceptives.</p><p>thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended 
 in a woman of childbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal form of contraception is also required, 
 because bexarotene belongs to a therapeutic class for which the human malformative risk is high.</p><p>
 paediatric population: 
 targretin is not recommended in children (aged below 18 years).</p><p>
 targretin contains a small amount of sorbitol, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of 
 fructose intolerance should not take this medicine.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>effects of other substances on bexarotene: no formal studies to evaluate interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome 
 p450 3a4 (cyp3a4), coadministration with other cyp3a4 substrates such as ketoconazole, 
 itraconazole, protease inhibitors, clarithromycin and erythromycin may theoretically lead to an 
 increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. furthermore, co-administration with cyp3a4 inducers 
 such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone or phenobarbital may theoretically cause a reduction in 
 plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p><p>
 caution is advised in case of combination with cyp3a4 substrates having a narrow therapeutic 
 margin i.e. immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) as well as cyp3a4-
 metabolised cytotoxics, i.e. cyclophosphamide, etoposide, finasteride, ifosfamide, tamoxifen, vinca-
 alcaloids.</p><p>
 a population analysis of plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with ctcl indicated that 
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of 
 bexarotene. the mechanism of this interaction is unknown. under similar conditions, bexarotene 
 concentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin or levothyroxine. 
 concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended.</p><p>
 effects of bexarotene on other substances: there are indications that bexarotene may induce cyp3a4.</p><p>therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-induction of its own 
 metabolism and, particularly at dose levels greater than 300 mg/m
 2/day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome 
 p450 3a4, such as tamoxifen.</p><p>for example bexarotene may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives 
 (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).</p><p>
 laboratory test interactions: ca125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuated with bexarotene therapy.</p><p>
 food interactions: in all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take targretin capsules with or immediately following a meal.</p><p>in one clinical study, plasma bexarotene auc and c
 max values were substantially higher following the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the 
 administration of a glucose solution.</p><p>because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based 
 upon administration with food, it is recommended that targretin capsules be administered with food.</p><p>
 on the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome p450 3a4, grapefruit juice may 
 theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.</p><p>6</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 
 fertility, pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of bexarotene in pregnant women. studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p><p>based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures 
 to bexarotene, a margin of safety for human teratogenicity has not been demonstrated (see section 5.3). 
 bexarotene is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>
 if this medicinal product is used inadvertently during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant 
 while taking this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus.</p><p>
 contraception in males and females: women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth-control 
 measures when bexarotene is used.</p><p>a negative, sensitive, pregnancy test (e.g. serum beta-human 
 chorionic gonadotropin, beta-hcg) should be obtained within one week prior to bexarotene therapy.</p><p>
 effective contraception must be used</p><p>from the time of the negative pregnancy test through the 
 initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>
 whenever contraception is required, it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be 
 used simultaneously.</p><p>bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically 
 reduce the efficacy of oestroprogestative contraceptives (see section</p><p>4.5).</p><p> thus, if treatment with 
 bexarotene is intended in a woman with childbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal contraceptive 
 method is also recommended.</p><p>male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, 
 or may potentially become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking 
 bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose.</p><p>breast-feeding:</p><p>it is unknown whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk.</p><p>bexarotene should not 
 be used in breast-feeding mothers.</p><p>
 fertility: there are no human data on the effect of bexarotene on fertility. in male dogs, some effects 
 have been documented (see section 5.3). effects on fertility cannot be excluded.</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. however, dizziness and visual difficulties have been reported in patients taking targretin. patients who 
 experience dizziness or visual difficulties during therapy must not drive or operate machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>a. summary of the safety profile:</p><p>
 the safety of bexarotene has been examined in clinical studies of 193 patients with ctcl who 
 received bexarotene for up to 118 weeks and in 420 non-ctcl cancer patients in other studies.</p><p>
 in 109 patients with ctcl treated at the recommended initial dose of 300 mg/m
 2/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions to targretin were hyperlipaemia ((primarily elevated 
 triglycerides) 74%), hypothyroidism (29%), hypercholesterolaemia (28%), headache (27%),

 the majority of adverse reactions were noted at a higher incidence at doses greater than 
 300 mg/m
 2/day. generally, these resolved without sequelae on dose reduction or withdrawal of treatment. however, among a total of 810 patients, including those without malignancy, treated with 
 bexarotene, there were three serious adverse reactions with fatal outcome (acute pancreatitis, subdural 
 haematoma and liver failure). of these, liver failure, subsequently determined to be not related to 
 bexarotene, was the only one to occur in a ctcl patient.</p><p>
 hypothyroidism generally occurs 4-8 weeks after commencement of therapy. it may be asymptomatic 
 and responds to treatment with thyroxine and resolves upon withdrawal of treatment.</p><p>
 bexarotene has a different adverse reaction profile to other oral, non-retinoid x receptor (rxr) -
 selective retinoids. owing to its primarily rxr-binding activity, bexarotene is less likely to cause 
 mucocutaneous, nail, and hair toxicities; arthralgia; and myalgia; which are frequently reported with 
 retinoic acid receptor (rar) -binding agents.</p><p>9</p></section><section><header n="4.9">4.9 overdose</header><p>no clinical experience with an overdose of targretin has been reported.</p><p>any overdose should be treated with supportive care for the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.</p><p>

 mechanism of action</p><p>
 bexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and 
 activation of the three rxrs: 
 , , and .</p><p>once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin 
 sensitisation.</p><p>the ability of the rxrs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are 
 important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene 
 are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the rars.</p><p>
 in vitro, bexarotene inhibits the growth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic and squamous cell origin. 
 in vivo, bexarotene causes tumour regression in some animal models and prevents tumour induction in others.</p><p>however, the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of 
 cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) is unknown.</p><p>
 clinical results</p><p>
 bexarotene capsules were evaluated in clinical trials of 193 patients with ctcl of whom 93 had 
 advanced stage disease refractory to prior systemic therapy. among the 61 patients treated at an initial 
 dose of 300 mg/m
 2/day, the overall response rate, according to a global assessment by the physician, was 51% (31/61) with a clinical complete response rate of 3%. responses were also determined by a 
 composite score of five clinical signs (surface area, erythema, plaque elevation, scaling and 
 hypo/hyperpigmentation) which also considered all extracutaneous ctcl manifestations. the overall 
 response rate according to this composite assessment was 31% (19/61) with a clinical complete 
 response rate of 7% (4/61)
 .</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption</p><p>
 absorption/dose proportionality: pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m2. terminal elimination half-life values were generally between one and three hours. following repeat once daily 
 dose administration at dose levels 
  230 mg/m2, cmax and auc in some patients were less than respective single dose values. no evidence of prolonged accumulation was observed. at the 
 recommended initial daily-dose level (300 mg/m
 2), single-dose and repeated daily-dose bexarotene pharmacokinetic parameters were similar.</p><p>10distribution</p><p>
 protein binding/distribution: bexarotene is highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. the uptake of bexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated.</p><p>
 biotransformation</p><p>
 metabolism: bexarotene metabolites in plasma include 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene.</p><p>
 in vitro studies suggest glucuronidation as a metabolic pathway, and that cytochrome p450 3a4 is the major cytochrome p450 isozyme responsible for formation of the oxidative 
 metabolites.</p><p>based on the 
 in vitro binding and the retinoid receptor activation profile of the metabolites, and on the relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have 
 little impact on the pharmacological profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.</p><p>
 elimination</p><p>excretion: neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. the estimated renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute.</p><p>renal excretion is not a 
 significant elimination pathway for bexarotene.</p><p>
 pharmacokinetics in special populations age:</p><p>based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 343 patients aged &lt; 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene 
 pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 body weight and gender: based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body 
 weight.</p><p>gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.</p><p>
 race: based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 caucasian and 44 black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in blacks and caucasians.</p><p>there are insufficient 
 data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>bexarotene is not genotoxic. carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. fertility studies have not been conducted; however, in sexually immature male dogs, reversible aspermatogenesis (28-day

 six months to sexually mature dogs, no testicular effects were seen. effects on fertility cannot be 
 excluded. bexarotene, in common with the majority of retinoids, was teratogenic and embryotoxic in 
 an animal test species at systemic exposures that are achievable clinically in humans. irreversible

 what targretin is and what it is used for</header><p>the active substance in targretin, bexarotene, belongs to a group of medicines known as retinoids, which are related to vitamin a.</p><p>
 targretin capsules are used by patients with advanced stage cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) 
 whose disease has not responded to other therapies. ctcl is a condition in which certain cells of the 
 body’s lymph system called t-lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin.</p></section><section><header n="2">2.  what you need to know before you take targretin

 - 
 if you have a history of pancreatitis, have uncontrolled lipid (blood fats) elevations (high blood 
 cholesterol or high blood triglycerides), have a condition known as hypervitaminosis a, have 
 uncontrolled thyroid disease, have insufficient liver function or have an ongoing systemic 
 infection.</p></section><section><header>warnings and precautions</header><p>talk to your doctor before taking targretin if you have a known hypersensitivity to retinoids (related to vitamin a), suffer from liver disease, have high blood lipids or take medicines which may cause 
 high blood lipids, have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), have had gall bladder or biliary 
 tract disease, or consume excessive amounts of alcohol.</p><p>
