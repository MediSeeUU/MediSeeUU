 patients (see section 4.4).</p><p>hepatic impairment no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. however, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, faslodex should be used with caution in these 
 patients. there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>

 faslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
 less than 30 ml/min)</p><p>
 due to the intramuscular route of administration, faslodex should be used with caution if treating 
 patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.</p><p>
 thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
 been observed in clinical trials with faslodex (see section 4.8). this should be taken into consideration 
 when prescribing faslodex to patients at risk.</p><p>
 there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. due to the mechanism of action of 
 fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>a clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of cyp3a4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp3a4. clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of cyp3a4) and 
 ketoconazole (inhibitor of cyp3a4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. 
 dose</p><p>adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and cyp3a4 
 inhibitors or inducers concomitantly.</p></section><section><header n="4.6">4.6 pregnancy and lactation</header><p>faslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). fulvestrant has been shown to cross the placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. studies in animals have shown reproductive 
 toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). patients 
 of child-bearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception while on treatment. if 
 pregnancy occurs while taking faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the 
 foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.</p><p>
 fulvestrant is excreted in milk in lactating rats. it is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in 
 human milk. considering the potential for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed 
 infants, lactation is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</p></section><section><header n="4.7">4.7 effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>faslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. however, since asthenia has been reported commonly with faslodex, caution should be observed by those patients 
 who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.</p></section><section><header n="4.8">4.8 undesirable effects</header><p>this section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-marketing studies or spontaneous reports. approximately 47 % of patients experienced adverse reactions in the 
 clinical trial programme.</p><p>however, only 0.9 % of patients stopped therapy because of an adverse

 mechanism of action 
 fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (er) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
 fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity.</p><p>
 the mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels.</p><p>5clinical trials in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant significantly down-regulates er protein in er positive tumours compared with placebo. there was 
 also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic 
 estrogen agonist effects.</p><p>
 clinical safety and efficacy in advanced breast cancer 
 two phase iii clinical trials were completed in a total of 851 postmenopausal women with advanced 
 breast cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression 
 following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. 77% of the study population had estrogen receptor 
 positive breast cancer. these trials compared the safety and efficacy of monthly administration of 
 250 mg fulvestrant versus the daily administration of 1 mg anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor).</p><p>
 overall, fulvestrant at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of 
 time to progression, objective response, and time to death. there were no statistically significant 
 differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment groups. time to progression was the 
 primary endpoint.</p><p>combined analysis of both trials showed that 83% of patients who received 
 fulvestrant progressed, compared with 85% of patients who received anastrozole. the hazard ratio of 
 fulvestrant to anastrozole for time to progression was 0.95 (95% ci 0.82 to 1.10). the objective 
 response rate for fulvestrant was 19.2% compared with 16.5% for anastrozole. the median time to 
 death was 27.4months for patients treated with fulvestrant and 27.6 months for patients treated with 
 anastrozole.</p><p>the hazard ratio of fulvestrant to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% ci 0.86 to 
 1.19).</p><p>analysis of results by er status showed that the use of fulvestrant should be restricted to 
 patients with er positive breast cancer.</p><p>
 effects on the postmenopausal endometrium preclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium (see section 5.3). a 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day 
 ethinylestradiol showed that pre-treatment with 250 mg fulvestrant resulted in significantly reduced 
 stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged 
 by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness</p><p>
 there are no data on the long-term effects of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium. no data 
 are available regarding endometrial morphology.</p><p>
 in two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) with premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
 disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measuring 
 between fulvestrant and placebo groups.</p><p>
 effects on bone there are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone.</p></section><section><header n="5.2">5.2 pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption after administration of faslodex long-acting as an intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly 
 absorbed and maximum plasma concentrations (c
 max) are reached after about 7 days. absorption continues for over one month, and monthly administration results in an approximate 2-fold 
 accumulation. steady-state levels are reached after about 6 monthly injections, with the major part of 
 the accumulation achieved after 3-4 doses. at steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are 
 maintained within a relatively narrow range with approximately 2- to 3-fold difference between 
 maximum and trough concentrations. after intramuscular administration, the exposure is 
 approximately dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 250 mg.</p><p>
 distribution 
 fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. the large apparent volume of distribution at 
 steady state (vd
 ss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. very low density lipoprotein (vldl), low</p><p>6density lipoprotein (ldl), and high density lipoprotein (hdl) fractions are the major binding components. no interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. the role of sex 
 hormone-binding globulin (shbg) has not been determined.</p><p>
 metabolism</p><p>the metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of 
 possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. identified metabolites 
 (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or 
 exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-estrogen models. studies using human liver preparations 
 and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cyp3a4 is the only p450 isoenzyme involved in the 
 oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-p450 routes appear to be more predominant 
 in vivo. in vitro data suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit cyp450 isoenzymes.</p><p>
 elimination</p><p>fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. the major route of excretion is via the faeces, 
 with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, 
 suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) after intramuscular administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.</p><p>
 special populations</p><p>in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase iii studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s 
 pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or 
 race.</p><p>
 renal impairment mild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to any clinically relevant extent.</p><p>
 hepatic impairment the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical trial conducted in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a and b). a high dose of a 
 shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. there was up to about 2.5-fold increase 
 in auc in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. in patients administered 
 faslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated.</p><p>subjects with 
 severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c) were not evaluated.</p></section><section><header n="5.3">5.3 preclinical safety data</header><p>the acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.</p><p> 
 faslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple 
 dose studies. local reactions, including myositis and granulomatoma at the injection site were 
 attributed to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to 
 the saline control. in toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, 
 the anti-estrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in 
 the female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes.</p><p>
 in dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
 (slight elevations of the s-t segment of the ecg [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
 were seen. these occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (c
 max &gt; 40 times) and are likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.</p><p>
 fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential. 
 fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
 anti-estrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. in rats, a reversible reduction in female 
 fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including 
 tarsal flexure were observed. rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. increases in</p><p>7placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. there was an increased incidence of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral 
 vertebrae).</p><p>
 a two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of faslodex) showed increased 
 incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days 
 and an increased incidence of testicular leydig cell tumours in males. induction of such tumours is 
 consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations. these findings are not of clinical 
 relevance for the use of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></section><section><header n="6">6. pharmaceutical particulars</header></section><section><header n="6.1">6.1 list of excipients</header><p>ethanol (96 per cent) benzyl alcohol</p><p>
