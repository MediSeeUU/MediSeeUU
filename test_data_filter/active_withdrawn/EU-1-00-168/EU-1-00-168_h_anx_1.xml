 the required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10
 seconds.
 a pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg in 0.9% sodium chloride solution only. tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is
 incompatible with dextrose solution.
 no other medicinal product should be added to the injection solution.
 adjunctive therapy
 acetylsalicylic acid (asa) and heparin should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis to
 inhibit the thrombogenic process.
 asa should be administered as soon as possible after ami symptom onset and continued as long-
 term treatment. the recommended initial oral dose is between 150 and 325 mg per day. if the patient
 is unable to ingest tablets, an initial dose of 100-250 mg may be given intravenously if available. the
 asa dosage during the following days will be at the discretion of the treating physician.
 heparin should be administered as soon as possible after the diagnosis of ami has been confirmed,
 and continued for at least 48 hours on a body weight adjusted basis. for patients weighing 67 kg or
 less, an initial intravenous heparin bolus not exceeding 4,000 iu is recommended followed initially by
 not more than an 800 iu/hour infusion. for patients weighing more than 67 kg, an initial intravenous
 heparin bolus not exceeding 5,000 iu is recommended followed initially by not more than 1,000
 iu/hour infusion. for patients already receiving heparin treatment, the initial bolus should not be
 given. the infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain an aptt of 50-75 seconds (1.5 to 2.5 times

 therapy is bleeding. the concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. as
 fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy, bleeding from recent
 puncture site may occur. therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all possible
 bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous puncture sites, cutdown sites and
 needle puncture sites). the use of rigid catheters as well as intramuscular injections and non-essential
 handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg.
 most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival
 bleeding were observed.
 should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration
 should be terminated immediately. administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has
 been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. in the few patients who fail to respond
 to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. transfusion of
 cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory
 reassessment after each administration. a target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with
 cryoprecipitate infusion. antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. the use of
 tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy has to be carefully evaluated in order to
 balance the potential risks with anticipated benefits under the following conditions:
 - systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm hg- cerebrovascular disease- recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days)- high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation- any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection- advanced age, i.e. over 75 years- low body weight &lt; 60 kgarrhythmias
 coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. it is recommended that
 antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator)
 be available when tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is administered.
 gpiib/iiia antagonists
 there is no experience with the use of gpiib/iiia antagonists within the first 24 hours after start of
 treatment.
 re-administration
 since at present there is no experience with re-administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg, the re-administration is not recommended. however, no antibody formation to the
 tenecteplase molecule has been observed. if an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be
 discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. in any case, tenecteplase should

 data from more than 12,000 patients treated during phase i, ii and iii did not reveal any clinically

 used with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg.
 medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine,

 5.1 
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, atc code: b01a dmechanism of action
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.
 pharmacodynamic effects
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 �2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phaseinhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u,
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.
 clinical effects
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.
 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is
 therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days,
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen.tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in
 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase
 distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma
 proteins in humans.
 7after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction,tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean
 +/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and
 plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans is not
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent andreversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in
 anaphylaxis.
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical
 exposure.
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose.
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.
 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous
 administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars

 5.1 
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, atc code: b01a dmechanism of action
 tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-pa
 by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. it binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus
 (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the
 fibrin matrix of the thrombus. tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to
 inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (pai-1) compared to native t-pa.
 pharmacodynamic effects
 after administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 
 �2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phaseinhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been
 observed. this observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. in
 comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in
 plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 u,
 corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and
 plasminogen levels. no clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.
 clinical effects
 patency data from the phase i and ii angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a
 single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects
 experiencing an ami on a dose related basis.
 a large scale mortality trial (assent ii) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is
 therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days,
 upper limit of the 95% ci for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated
 with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). this
 translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). intracranial
 haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.
 coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that ami patients have been successfully
 treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen.tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by
 catabolism to small peptides. binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
 pa, resulting in a prolonged half-life. data on tissue distribution and elimination were obtained in
 studies with radioactively labeled tenecteplase in rats. the main organ to which tenecteplase
 distributed was the liver. it is not known whether and to what extent tenecteplase binds to plasma
 proteins in humans.
 after single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction,
 tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. there is no dose dependence of
 tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. the initial, dominant half life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean
 15+/-sd) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-pa. the terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, andplasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min.
 increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age
 resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this
 can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.
 the effect of renal and hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase</p><p>in humans is not
 known. there is no specific experience to guide the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with
 hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. however, based on animal data it is not expected that renal
 dysfunction will affect the pharmacokinetics.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent andreversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which
 was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. multiple-dose toxicity
 studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was
 limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in
 anaphylaxis.
 safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by
 changes of ecg, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical
 exposure.
 with regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity
 testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits as a sensitive species. tenecteplase induced
 total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. when tenecteplase was given during the mid- or
 late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose.
 secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. data on the foetal period are not available.
 mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and
 genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.
 no local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous
 administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars

 the required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10
 seconds.
 a pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg in 0.9% sodium chloride solution only. tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is
 incompatible with dextrose solution.
 no other medicinal product should be added to the injection solution.
 adjunctive therapy
 acetylsalicylic acid (asa) and heparin should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis to
 inhibit the thrombogenic process.
 asa should be administered as soon as possible after ami symptom onset and continued as long-term
 treatment. the recommended initial oral dose is between 150 and 325 mg per day. if the patient is
 unable to ingest tablets, an initial dose of 100-250 mg may be given intravenously if available. the
 asa dosage during the following days will be at the discretion of the treating physician.
 heparin should be administered as soon as possible after the diagnosis of ami has been confirmed,
 and continued for at least 48 hours on a body weight adjusted basis. for patients weighing 67 kg or
 less, an initial intravenous heparin bolus not exceeding 4,000 iu is recommended followed initially by
 not more than an 800 iu/hour infusion. for patients weighing more than 67 kg, an initial intravenous
 heparin bolus not exceeding 5,000 iu is recommended followed initially by not more than 1,000
 iu/hour infusion. for patients already receiving heparin treatment, the initial bolus should not be
 given. the infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain an aptt of 50-75 seconds (1.5 to 2.5 times
 control or a heparin plasma level of 0.2 to 0.5 iu/ml).</p></section><section><header>4.3contraindications</header><p>tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is contraindicated in the following situations becausethrombolytic therapy is associated with a higher risk of bleeding:
 - significant bleeding disorder either at present or within the past 6 months- patients with current concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy (inr &gt; 1.3)- any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinalsurgery)
 - known haemorrhagic diathesis- severe uncontrolled hypertension- major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2 months- (this includes any trauma associated with the current ami)- recent trauma to the head or cranium- prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 2 minutes) within the past 2 weeks- acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis- acute pancreatitis20-</p><p>severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension(oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis
 - diabetic haemorrhagic retinopathy or other haemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions- active peptic ulceration- arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation- neoplasm with increased bleeding risk- any known history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack or dementia- hypersensitivity to the active substance tenecteplase and to any of the excipients</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>bleedingthe most common complication encountered during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg
 therapy is bleeding. the concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. as
 fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy, bleeding from recent
 puncture site may occur. therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all possible
 bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous puncture sites, cutdown sites and
 needle puncture sites). the use of rigid catheters as well as intramuscular injections and non-essential
 handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg.
 most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival
 bleeding were observed.
 should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration
 should be terminated immediately. administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has
 been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. in the few patients who fail to respond
 to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. transfusion of
 cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory
 reassessment after each administration. a target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with
 cryoprecipitate infusion. antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. the use of
 tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg therapy has to be carefully evaluated in order to
 balance the potential risks with anticipated benefits under the following conditions:
 - systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm hg- cerebrovascular disease- recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days)- high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation- any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection- advanced age, i.e. over 75 years- low body weight &lt; 60 kgarrhythmias
 coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. it is recommended that
 antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator)
 be available when tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg is administered.
 gpiib/iiia antagonists
 there is no experience with the use of gpiib/iiia antagonists within the first 24 hours after start of
 treatment.
 re-administration
 since at present there is no experience with re-administration of tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim
 pharma kg, the re-administration is not recommended. however, no antibody formation to the
 tenecteplase molecule has been observed. if an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be
 discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. in any case, tenecteplase should
 21not be re-administered before assessment of haemostatic factors like fibrinogen, plasminogen andalpha2-antiplasmin.</p></section><section><header n="4.5">4.5. 
 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>no formal interaction studies with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg and medicinalproducts commonly administered in patients with ami have been performed. however, the analysis of
 data from more than 12,000 patients treated during phase i, ii and iii did not reveal any clinically
 relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used in patients with ami and concomitantly
 used with tenecteplase boehringer ingelheim pharma kg.
 medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function</p><p>(e.g. ticlopidine,
