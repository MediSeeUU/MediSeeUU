 with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. the overall 5-year survival rate (1992-1998) was 
 approximately 35%. acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is predominantly a disease of childhood and the 
 incidence in adults is less than one per 100.000 people. of these approximately 20-25% produces the 
 philadelphia chromosome, long-term survival at 10 years in adults is in the range of 25-35%.</p><p>
 chronic myeloid leukaemia is a haematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with a reciprocal 
 translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 to produce the philadelphia chromosome. this 
 chromosomal translocation results in a chimeric protein product bcr-abl, which is a constitutively 
 active form of the abl tyrosine kinase. cml is a progressive disease, which evolves through chronic, 
 accelerated, and blast crisis phases. blast phase is the most advanced stage of cml and is highly 
 refractory to therapy. the blast phase phenotype is myeloblastic in two-thirds of patients and 
 lymphoblastic in the remaining one-third.</p><p>
 both imatinib, an oral inhibitor of the abl kinase, and interferon, an injectable immune modulator, 
 produce durable responses in patients with cml. based on high rates of both haematologic and 
 cytogenetic responses, imatinib is currently approved for use in newly diagnosed cml patients as well 
 as in cml blast phase patients previously treated with interferon. imatinib is most effective in patients 
 with chronic phase cml, in whom the complete haematologic response (chr) rate is 95% and the 
 complete cytogenetic response (ccyr) rate is 39%. in patients with accelerated, myeloid, or lymphoid 
 blast phase cml, or ph+ all, imatinib is less effective.</p><p>
 although imatinib is effective in treating newly diagnosed cml, resistance to imatinib has emerged. 
 the 2-year incidence of resistance is estimated to be 80% in blast phase, 40% to 50% in accelerated 
 phase, and at least 10% in chronic phase.</p></section><section><header>about the product</header><p>dasatinib inhibits the activity of the bcr-abl kinase and src family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c-kit, ephrin (eph) receptor kinases, and pdgfβ 
 receptor. dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the bcr-abl kinase with potency at 
 concentration of 0.6-0.8 nm. it binds to both the inactive and active conformations of the bcr-abl 
 enzyme.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. quality aspects</header></section><section><header>introduction</header><p>sprycel is presented as a film-coated tablets containing 20 mg, 50 mg and 70 mg of dasatinib as active substance. the other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose,

 dasatinib tablets were developed in 5 and 50-mg strengths to cover a dose range of 15 - 180 mg for 
 phase i clinical studies. these tablets were manufactured using a wet granulation process. for phase ii 
 clinical studies and commercialization, a wet granulation process was developed to cover a potential 
 tablet strength of 20 - 150 mg. 20 and 50-mg tablets were developed using the 25% w/w drug load 
 granulation for phase ii clinical studies to cover a dose range of 20 - 100 mg (twice a day). this same 
 formulation (i.e., same drug load granulation) was used to manufacture 150-mg tablets for long-term 
 stability studies (ltss) to provide a bracket for any intermediate strengths (i.e., between 20 and 150 
 mg). additionally, 70-mg tablets developed for commercialization using the same drug load 
 granulation. 
 in fact the proposed commercial tablets, 20, 50, and 70 mg, will be manufactured from the same drug 
 load granulation and use similar processes that were used to manufacture tablets for phase ii clinical 
 studies and ltss. however the only difference between the phase ii/ltss and the proposed 
 commercial tablets is in their debossing. this difference in debossing is not expected to have any 
 impact on the quality or performance of the finished product. 
 the phase ii/ltss/commercial formulation has the same qualitative composition as the phase i 
 formulations with the exception of the film coat.</p><p>the manufacturing process of major unit operations (i.e., granulation, drying, and lubrication) was 
 characterized at both laboratory and pilot scales using statistical experimental designs. coating 
 parameters were chosen based on prior experience with similar coating materials.</p><p>
 dasatinib is characterized as a low solubility/high permeability (bcs ii) compound according to the 
 biopharmaceutics classification system (bcs). in this context, dissolution of dasatinib can potentially 
 be rate-limiting for absorption. the dissolution of a poorly soluble drug can be influenced by its 
 particle size distribution. after several studies it was concluded that the active substance with particle 
 size d[90] ranging from 4 to 130 microns has been shown to have no impact on blend flow, 
 in-vitro tablet dissolution and content uniformity, and has produced tablets with satisfactory hardness. results of the study demonstrated the ruggedness of the formulation and manufacturing process with respect 
 to active substance particle size.</p><p>
 the mah intends to market 20, 50, and 70-mg strength tablets. the proposed commercial tablets, 20 
 and 50 mg, are</p><p>qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the 20 and 50-mg tablets used in phase ii 
 studies with the exception of debossing. the results of a bioequivalence study demonstrated that the 
 70-mg tablet is bioequivalent to the combination of 20-mg plus 50-mg tablets. 
 in conclusion, statistical experimental designs, in combination with characterization of functional 
 excipients and active substance, have been used to understand the tablet formulation and 
 manufacturing process. results of formulation and process development studies demonstrate that the 
 tablet formulation and the manufacturing process are robust.</p><p>
 •</p></section><section><header>manufacture of the product</header><p>the proposed commercial manufacturing process involves standard technology using standard manufacturing processes such as wet granulation, drying, milling, blending, compression and film-
 coating unit operations. furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical 
 industry. 
 the major steps to prepare dasatinib tablets are the granulation and drying processes for the 
 manufacture of the granules, the blending/lubrication process for the manufacture of the final blend, 
 and the tablet compression process.</p><p>
 the batch analysis results show that the medicinal product can be manufactured reproducibly 
 according the agreed finished product specifications.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 4/46</p><p> •</p></section><section><header>product specification</header><p>the medicinal product specifications were established according the ich guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, identification (hplc and raman or atr:ir), assay, 
 impurities/degradants (hplc), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial limits (ph eur).</p><p>
 all analytical procedures which were used for testing the medicinal product were properly described. 
 moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the chmp and ich 
 guidelines.</p><p>
 •</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>the stability studies were conducted according to the current ich guideline. three production scale batches of each strength have been stored at long term and accelerated conditions in the proposed 
 market packaging.</p><p>
 one production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature and humidity conditions for 
 3 months and at ich conditions and another production batch per strength was stored for 
 photostability at ich conditions. 
 based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the 
 spc are acceptable.</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant guidelines. the 
 results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the finished product. 
 therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
 at the time of the chmp opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues which do not have 
 any impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. the applicant gave a letter of 
 undertaking and committed to resolve these as follow up measures after the opinion, within an agreed 
 timeframe.</p></section><section><header n="3">3. non-clinical aspects</header></section><section><header>introduction</header><p>the non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted according to glp. the safety pharmacology studies were glp-compliant with exception of the herg and purkinje fibre evaluations (conducted before the 
 release of the ich s7b guideline).</p></section><section><header>pharmacology</header><p>pharmacology studies included in vitro and in vivo studies to determine dasatinib’s kinase inhibition selectivity spectrum, potency versus bcr-abl kinase activity, mode of binding to bcr-abl, 
 leukemic cell-killing potency, and activity against multiple forms of imatinib resistance. these studies 
 defined a pharmacological profile for dasatinib that has some distinct aspects as compared to imatinib 
 and provide a rationale for the development of dasatinib for the treatment of cml and all.</p><p>
 • primary pharmacodynamics</p><p>in vitro pharmacology x-ray crystal structure analysis of the abl kinase domain in complex with dasatinib revealed that, like imatinib, dasatinib binds in the atp-binding site of the abl kinase. dasatinib binds to the active 
 or “opened” conformation of the bcr-abl kinase domain and is predicted, based on modeling 
 studies, to also bind to the inactive or “closed” conformation.</p><p>
 the inhibitory activity of dasatinib was evaluated 
 in vitro on five tyrosine kinase families src family kinases (src, lck, yes, fyn), bcr-abl, kit, epha2 and pdgfβ.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 5/46 
 results demonstrated, that dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of selected protein tyrosine kinases of which src, bcr-abl, kit, pdgf receptor and eph receptor have been linked to various forms of human 
 malignancies. 
 moreover, dasatinib killed or inhibited the proliferation of three human bcr-abl dependent cml 
 cell lines and one human bcr-abl dependent all cell line. dasatinib exhibited a high growth 
 inhibitory potential in the four tested leukaemia cell lines with ic
 50 values ≤1 nm. imatinib was considerably less potent in this cellular assay with a 300-655 fold difference in potency. 
 both imatinib and dasatinib induced erythroid differentiation and cell death in the 
 erythromyeloblastoid k-562 cml cell line although dasatinib appeared to be at least 150-fold more 
 potent than imatinib in inducing this response.</p><p>
 dasatinib demonstrated antiproliferative activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) 
 treated with vegf or bfgf. ic
 50 values of 42 nm and 248 nm were obtained under conditions with vegf-stimulated and bfgf-stimulated growth, respectively. additionally, dasatinib attenuated vegf 
 and bfgf stimulated huvec endothelial cell migration 
 in vitro (ic50&lt;5 nm).</p><p> 
 in vivo pharmacology the tumour inhibiting activity of dasatinib was evaluated in human cml xenograft models grown sc in scid mice. cures were defined as the absence of detectable tumour at a time greater than ten times 
 the tumour volume doubling time after the cessation of treatment. 
 dasatinib was curative in mice bearing k562 human cml tumours over a range of dose levels (8-50 
 mg/kg) when administered po once a day for 10 days using a “5-days-on and 2-days off” treatment 
 regimen. treatment was initiated when the tumours reached a size of 200 to 500 mg. high doses of 
 imatinib failed to produce a comparative response. the minimum effective dose for dasatinib was 
 determined as 2.5 mg/kg. in addition, dasatinib was highly efficient in this model when administered 
 iv. dasatinib was curative in mice bearing large ku812 tumours (up to &gt; 1g tumour) when treated 
 with 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days.</p><p>
 the src phosphorylation was investigated in peripheral mononuclear cell (pbmcs) collected from 
 human prostate cancer cell (pc-3) bearing mice administered 1, 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg dasatinib. dasatinib 
 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of src phosphorylation with an almost complete 
 inhibition within 5 hours following administration of 15 and 50 mg/kg. administration of 5 mg/kg 
 resulted in 44% inhibition of src phosphorylation whereas 1 mg/kg was almost inactive. based on 
 auc
 0-24h values, the animal:human plasma exposure ratios were 0.8 and 1.9 for the 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. based on pharmacokinetic data it was estimated that the dasatinib 
 plasma concentration required to inhibit 50% of phospho-src was 91 nm in pbmcs.</p><p>
 dasatinib treatment (10 mg/kg/day) increased survival in mice inoculated intracranially with k562 
 cml cells and the survival efficacy was superior to what was observed with imatinib (300 
 mg/kg/day). in a similar study, increased survival was observed following treatment with 10 and 30 
 mg/kg/day dasatinib whereas 200 mg/kg/day imatinib failed to inhibit intracranial tumour growth. 
 thus dasatinib appears to have a therapeutic advantage over imatinib in the treatment of intracranial 
 cml.</p><p>
 dasatinib was equally active against a human cml model in mice whether treatment was 
 administered daily for ten consecutive days or if a short treatment break (5-days-on and 2-days off) 
 was introduced into the dosing regimen. moreover, a twice-daily dosing regimen produced efficacy 
 that was superior to the once daily dosing regimen. consequently, in mice bearing k562 human cml 
 tumours, a superior anti-tumour activity (cure) was observed in the twice-daily 1.25 mg/kg dose group 
 when compared to the dose group administered 2.5 mg/kg dasatinib on a once-daily schedule (growth 
 inhibition).</p><p>
 cellular activity of human dasatinib metabolites in cancer patients, the systemic exposure of the metabolites represented 1-13% of the drug-related material. furthermore, bms-582691, the pharmacologically most potent metabolite, represented 
 maximally 4% of dasatinib-related radioactivity in the 
 in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies conducted with humans or human liver microsomes. therefore, the dasatinib metabolites are not 
 expected to contribute significantly to the pharmacological activity of dasatinib.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 6/46 
 • secondary pharmacodynamics dasatinib affinity towards 42 different receptors and channels was evaluated in a competitive binding 
 assay. dasatinib had no significant effect (all assays were ≤46% inhibition at 10 µm) on the binding of 
 any of the receptor or ion-channel ligands evaluated and no effect on acetylcholinesterase activity 
 (930003305). 
 dasatinib proved less potent against selected non-target protein tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine 
 kinases. an ic
 50 value of at least 5,000 nm was obtained for fak, igf1 receptor, insulin receptor, pka, pkc, gsk-3, met, emt/zap-70, syk and camkii. moreover, ic
 50 values were obtained for vegf receptor-2 (&gt;2,000 nm), fgf receptor (880 nm), mek kinase (1700 nm), her1 receptor 
 (180 nm), her2 receptor (710 nm) and p38 (103 nm) (930003300). 
 the three major dasatinib metabolites, bms-573188 (carboxylic acid), bms-582691 (n-dealkylated), 
 and bms-606181 (n-oxide), were evaluated 
 in vitro for their ability to inhibit or stimulate the binding of appropriate radioligands to 34 different receptors or ion channels and to inhibit the activities of 4 
 different enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, monamine oxidases a and b, and phosphodiesterase-3). 
 bms-573188, and bms-606181 at 10 
 µm had no biologically relevant effect on binding of any of these ligands to their receptors or ion channels or on any enzyme activities evaluated. bms-582691 at 
 10 
 µm had ≥ 50% effects on 7 of the 34 receptors/channels evaluated (adrenergic β2, non-selective adrenergic α2, non-selective serotonin 5-ht1, serotonin 5-ht1a, norepinephrine transporter, and 
 dopamine transporter receptors, and the sodium channel) (930011274).</p><p>
 • safety pharmacology programme when tested in hek cells stably transfected with the human herg/ikr channel, dasatanib inhibited 
 the herg currents by 6, 37 and 77% at 3, 10 and 30 µm, respectively. the calculated ic50 was 14.3 
 µm. in accordance with these findings, 30 µm dasatinib prolonged apd
 50 by 26% and apd90 by 11% in the rabbit purkinje fibre assay. the recorded action potential prolongations were ≤ 5% at 3 and 10 
 µm (non-glp, 920018211). nevertheless no changes in ecg parameters were observed up to 22 
 hours following administration of 10 mg/kg dasatinib to six instrumented conscious monkeys. 
 treatment-related findings consisted of increases in systolic (5 -15%) and diastolic (8-21%) blood 
 pressure for approximately two hours following dasatinib administration when compared to vehicle 
 control (glp, 930005453). in addition, no effect on ecg following single-dose administration to 
 monkeys at plasma exposure levels up to 27 times higher than what is seen in patients administered 70 
 mg/kg bid (n=2) (930003271). moreover, no effect on heart rate or ecg (anesthetized animals) was 
 observed in a one-month intermittent oral toxicity study in monkeys.</p><p>
 evaluation of the potential effects of dasatinib on cns and respiratory system were conducted as part 
 of single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys. nervous system evaluations were conducted as 
 part of comprehensive physical examinations and included assessments of temperament or behaviour, 
 movement, coordination or balance/muscle tone, peripheral reflexes, proprioception, and functions of 
 cranial nerves ii through xii. these evaluations did not demonstrate any dasatinib-related changes in 
 neurologic function at exposures approximately 3- to 28-fold greater than exposures in humans at the 
 recommended clinical dose. 
 respiratory system evaluations included assessments of lung sounds by thoracic auscultation and 
 respiratory rate. these evaluations did not demonstrate any dasatinib-related changes in respiratory 
 function at exposures approximately 3- to 28-fold greater than exposures in humans at the 
 recommended clinical dose. 
 the major dasatinib metabolites were tested in herg and purkinje fibre assays for their potential 
 effects on cardiac function. bms-573188 inhibited ikr currents by approximately 6 and 11% at 10 
 and 30 
 µm; bms-582691 inhibited ikr currents by 24, 72, and 95% at 3, 10 and 30 µm; and bms-606181 inhibited ikr currents by 8 and 12% at 10 and 30 
 µm, respectively. in the purkinje-fibre assay at 30 
 µm, bms-573188 and bms-606181 had no biologically relevant effects on action potential duration, whereas bms-582691 prolonged apd50 and apd90 by 10 and 9%, respectively (non-glp, 
 930010945).</p><p>
 • pharmacodynamic drug interactions it is possible that the onset of acquired drug resistance will be minimized by combining imatinib and 
 dasatinib treatment. the effect of concomitant imatinib and dasatinib treatment was investigated 
 applying assays for cellular proliferation and bcr-abl phosphorylation on ba/f3 expressing wild-
 type bcr-abl and four common imatinib-resistant mutants (y253f, e255k, t315i, and m351t).</p><p>©emea 2006 page 7/46 
 the studies showed that dasatinib retains its inhibitory capacity when coadministered with imatinib at concentrations several-fold above typical clinical levels. in fact, co-administering imatinib with 
 dasatinib resulted in lower cell proliferation ic
 50 values than observed with the single-treatments, suggesting an additive antiproliferative effect. as expected, cells expressing the bcr-abl mutant 
 t315i were not sensitive to neither imatinib nor dasatinib treatment (o’hare et al., 2005).</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>plasma samples collected from rats, rabbits, and monkeys in glp toxicokinetic studies were analysed with validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry methods to determine 
 concentrations of dasatinib. adequate precision and accuracy were obtained with the analytical 
 methods. the toxicokinetic method validation studies were not glp-compliant; however the 
 toxicokinetic evaluations performed in the course of the toxicity studies were compliant with glp 
 regulations.</p><p>
 dasatinib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration to mice, rats, dogs and monkeys with 
 t
 max ranging from 0.6 to 2.3 hours. the oral bioavailability was rather low with values ranging from 14% to 34%. the steady state volume of distribution of dasatinib in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys 
 were greater than the volume of total body water, suggesting extravascular distribution of the drug. 
 based on a caco-2 permeability assay and 
 in vivo data, dasatinib does not appear to be a p-glycoprotein substrate.</p><p>
 the serum protein binding of dasatinib was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 10 µm and was 
 found to be 92%, 97%, 96%, 97%, and 94% in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human, respectively. the 
 largest percentages of the radioactive dose were associated with tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and 
 liver following a single po administration of 
 14c-dasatinib to long-evans rats. these findings are consistent with the oral route of dasatinib administration and major route of elimination in the faeces. 
 at 168 h post-dose, radioactivity was only detected in 4 of the 22 sampled tissues (adrenal glands, 
 eyes, kidneys, and liver). dasatinib displayed melatonin affinity and absorbs light in the 290 to 700 
 nm range thus a phototoxicity study has been conducted by the applicant.</p><p>
 the metabolism of 
 14c-dasatinib was investigated in vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans following po administration. unchanged dasatinib was the most abundant drug-related component in the plasma of 
 rats (34-55% at 1-8 h), monkeys (32% at 4 h), and humans (26% at 2 h). still, the studies showed that 
 dasatinib undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism and conjugation thus in total 29 metabolites were 
 detected the samples collected from rats, monkeys, and humans. cyp3a4 appears to play a major role 
 in dasatinib metabolism. in addition, fmo3 seems involved. multiple glucuronide conjugates of 
 dasatinib were detected, however the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes 
 responsible for the direct glucuronidation of dasatinib have not been identified. dasatinib treatment 
 did not increase cyp enzyme activity or expression in primary human hepatocytes whereas it 
 inhibited the activites of liver microsome cyp2c8 (ki of 3.6 
 µm) and cyp3a4 (ki = 1.9 µm). a c
 max value of 0.12 µm has been reported in humans and accordingly, there is a possibility of interactions between dasatinib and drugs that are cyp3a4 and cyp2c8 substrates. a clinical drug 
 interaction study showed that coadministration with the cyp3a4 substrate simvastatin increased the 
 exposures of simvastatin and simvastatin acid with approximately 20% and 27%, respectively. 
 warnings are given in the spc on the risk for pharmacokinetic drug interactions when dasatinib is 
 coadministered with other cyp3a4 substrates. however, the risk for interactions with cyp2c8 
 substrates (e.g. the cancer drug paclitaxel, glitazones, torsemide) has not been evaluated.</p><p>
 biliary excretion was the predominant route for dasatinib elimination in rats, monkeys and humans 
 following oral administration whereas urinary excretion only played a minor role.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>dasatinib was administered po in all the toxicological studies since this is the intended clinical way of administration.</p><p>
 • single dose toxicity single-dose toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys. mortalities were observed in rats 
 administered 100 mg/kg. all monkeys were sacrificed due to a moribund condition following</p><p>©emea 2006 page 8/46 
 administration of 45 mg/kg; a dose resulting in dasatinib plasma exposure levels 27 times higher than is observed in patients administered 70 mg/kg bid. the major target tissues appeared to be skin 
 (haemorrhage), immune system (lymphoid depletion and decrease in lymphocytes), gastrointestinal 
 tract (ulceration, haemorrhage), kidney (kidney tubule dilatation) and heart (haemorrhage and/or 
 necrosis). in addition, bone resorption was inhibited leading to decreased plasma calcium and 
 phosphorus levels. the majority of the findings were reversible or partially reversible within the 14 
 days recovery period. 
 based on toxicokinetic analysis performed in monkeys, dasatinib plasma exposure (auc) was on 
 average 2493, 4587 and 8258 for both sexes following administration of 15, 25 and 45 mg/kg, 
 respectively. the obtained exposure levels were approximately 8, 15 and 27 times higher than what is 
 seen in patients administered 70 mg/kg bid.</p><p>
 • repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in sprague-dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. all 
 doses and concentrations were corrected for free base content and drug purity. the vehicle consisted 
 either of sodium acetate buffer or sodium citrate buffer. 
 an exploratory repeat-dose toxicity study conducted in two dogs was discontinued after two days due 
 to gastrointestinal toxicity (930003268). dasatinib treatment (5 mg/kg) induced emesis and bloody 
 vomitus and liquid, mucous and bloody faeces within two hours post-dosing. additional findings 
 consisted of red discolouration of the mesenteric lymph node and mucosae of the stomach, small 
 intestine and colon. microscopically, thymic lymphoid depletion was observed in the female. 
 decreases in total protein, albumin, and globulins were observed. 
 the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeat-
 dose toxicity studies. the major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month 
 monkey study, animals were euthanized due to gi toxicity when exposed to clinically relevant 
 dasatinib plasma levels. in rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at 
 plasma exposure levels (auc) four-fold higher than observed in patients (70 mg bid). the 
 predominant causes of death in rats were gi and lymphoid toxicity. consistent gi findings were dose-
 related enteropathy, faecal abnormalities, vomiting, distension of the gi tract with gas/fluid/digesta 
 and gi tract haemorrhage. microscopic evaluations performed in rats detected dose-related villus 
 alterations in the small intestine along with epithelial hyperplasia and fibrosis. in addition, small 
 intestine villous blunting and inflammation were recorded in monkeys. the haematology and clinical 
 chemistry findings suggested inflammation, blood loss, poor food consumption and electrolyte loss. 
 the gi toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant auc levels. diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting 
 are very common findings in the clinical setting while e.g. gi haemorrhage, stomatitis, colitis and 
 abdominal pain are common findings in patients undergoing dasatinib treatment. bleeding is 
 exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet function and 
 bleeding-related events have been reported in patients taking dasatinib. erythroid toxicity was 
 observed in the form of reduced erythrocytes, haemoglobin and haematocrit counts. moreover, a 
 reduction in the number of erythroid cells was observed in the bone marrow of monkeys without 
 safety margin. anaemia is a common finding in dasatinib-treated patients. lymphoid toxicity was 
 observed in the form of lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and an accompanying reduction 
 in thymus and spleen weight. in addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic t-cells and b-
 cells were observed in rats. hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose giving 
 rise to 4 to 6-fold higher auc values than observed in patients. infections were not observed in the 
 non-clinical studies but are common in the clinical setting. dasatanib potently inhibits osteoclastic 
 bone resorption and reduced plasma calcium and/or phosphorus levels were frequent findings in the 
 repeat-dose toxicity studies. increases in liver weight and aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 
 rats without correlative microscopic findings. furthermore, increased heart weight (no microscopic 
 findings), increased ovary weight and an increase in corpora lutea were observed in dasatinib-treated 
 rats. these findings were also observed in a long-term toxicity study conducted with imatinib. 
 dasatinib administration caused an increase in the incidence and severity of kidney mineralization in 
 the monkey 9-month toxicity study. in addition, an increase in prerenal or renal azotemia was 
 observed. no signs of renal function impairment were detected in the other non-clinical studies. all 
 dasatinib-related changes were generally reversible in surviving animals except for the increase in 
 kidney mineralization.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 9/46 
 • genotoxicity the genotoxic potential of dasatinib was evaluated in a standard battery of 
 in vitro and in vivo tests. moderate to marked cytotoxicity was observed in the 
 salmonella and e. coli strains cultured at dasatinib concentrations of 400 and 1600 µg/plate, respectively. dasatinib was tested for its ability to 
 induce chromosomal aberrations in cho cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activation 
 (s9) and with treatment period of 4 or 20 hours. under the conditions tested, dasatinib was clastogenic 
 at the highest concentrations evaluated with 12-31% structural aberrations versus 0% for the vehicle 
 control. cytotoxicity was observed at these concentrations levels. at lower dasatinib concentrations, 
 the percentage of cells with structural aberrations (1.5-5%) were within the historical control range 
 although a significant increase was detected when compared to vehicle control. no chromosomal 
 aberrations were observed at 2.5 µg/ml following 20 h incubation in the absence of metabolic 
 activation. there was no significant increase in the incidence of numerical aberrations. dasatinib did 
 not increase the frequency of polychromatic erythrocytes (pce) with micronuclei when compared 
 with to the vehicle control values. bone marrow toxicity was observed at the 20 and 40 mg/kg dose 
 levels with pce reductions of approximately 20 and 45%, respectively.</p><p>
 • carcinogenicity no studies have been performed.</p><p>
 • reproduction toxicity dasatanib’s potential effects on embryo-foetal development were evaluated in pregnant rats and 
 rabbits.</p><p>
 in rats, administration of dasatinib during the period of organogenesis induced embryolethality at all 
 doses with 17%, 77%, 100% and 100% resorbed conceptuses per litter at 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, 
 respectively. foetal skeletal alterations at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day (mean maternal auc values 
 ≤ 239 ng·hr/ml) included bent scapula or humerus and reduced ossification of the sternebrae and thoracic 
 vertebral centra. besides skeletal findings, foetal abnormalities at 5 mg/kg/day included fluid-filled 
 thoracic and abdominal cavities, oedema and small liver. there were no surviving foetuses at 10 or 20 
 mg/kg/day (mean maternal auc values of 1270 to 1490 ng·hr/ml). maternal toxicity was observed in 
 rats at doses 
 ≥ 10 mg/kg/day; mortality occurred at 20 mg/kg/day.</p><p>embryolethality with associated decreases in litter size was observed at 10 mg/kg/day dasatinib in a 
 rabbit dose-finding study, whereas lower doses did not give rise to embryo-foetal findings. in the 
 pivotal rabbit study, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal toxicity at 
 all doses (0.5, 2, or 6 mg/kg/day, mean auc values 
 ≥ 44 ng·hr/ml). the skeletal abnormalities consisted of delays in ossification of foetal lumbar vertebrae and pelvis. at 6 mg/kg, dasatinib also 
 caused irregular ossification of the hyoid. thus, dasatinib caused foetal alterations in rats and rabbits 
 at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity.</p><p>

 • other toxicity studies dasatinib was phototoxic in a neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay performed in balb/c 3t3 mouse

 immunotox 
 dasatinib at daily doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg for 3 days inhibited the proliferation of murine splenic t-
 cells in a dose-dependent manner. in the cardiac transplant study, dasatinib given twice daily at 25 
 mg/kg for up to 30 days inhibited graft rejection in mice. the observed immunosuppression appeared 
 comparable to that of cyclosporine. however, 15 mg/kg given twice daily (continuous daily dosing) or 
 25 mg/kg given twice daily (5-days on and 2-days off schedule) for 30 days did not extend graft 
 survival time.</p><p>
 immunotoxicity was observed in the standard toxicity studies in the form of lymphoid depletion of the 
 thymus and spleen and an accompanying reduction in thymus and spleen weight at clinically relevant 
 doses in long-term studies. hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose giving 
 rise to 4 to 6-fold higher auc values than observed in patients. in addition, reductions in plasma 
 lymphocytes and splenic t-cells and b-cells were observed in rats administered 15 mg/kg dasatinib</p><p>©emea 2006 page 10/46 
 for two weeks (rat:human auc exposure margin around 3). despite the decreases in splenic lymphocyte subpopulations and weights at 15 mg/kg, dasatinib treatment did not have any adverse 
 effect on the t-cell dependent antibody response to the antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh).</p><p>

 dasatanib potently inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption. dasatinib dose-dependently inhibited pth-
 stimulated release of 
 45ca into the medium by fetal rat long bones in vitro with an apparent ic50 of 2 nm. at 5 nm dasatinib completely blocked pth-stimulated bone resorption 
 in vitro. moreover, dasatinib blocked the normalization of plasma calcium in the thyro-parathyroidectomized rat model 
 after pth infusion.</p><p>
 in vitro, dasatinib inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation in human, monkey, and rat platelet-rich plasma at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 
 µg/ml, but no effect was observed at 0.05 µg/ml (0.1 µm). dasatinib produced near-complete (94%) inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation of human 
 platelets at 5 
 µg/ml, with 46% inhibition at 0.5 µg/ml, and no effect at 0.05 µg/ml. the effect of dasatinib on human whole blood clot formation was limited to a 29% reduction in clot strength at 5 
 µg/ml, with no effect at 0.5 µg/ml. in vivo, dasatinib at mean plasma concentrations ≥ 144 ng/ml in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding. bleeding time was not 
 extended at a plasma exposure of 61 ng/ml.</p></section><section><header>ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</header><p>in the calculations of pecsw, the market penetration factor (normally default 1%) was calculated to 0.006 µg/l. studies were performed including an acute toxicity study in green algae, a full life-cycle 
 toxicity test in daphnia magna and an acute toxicity study in rainbow trout. in addition, dasatinib was 
 evaluated with respect to activated sludge respiration inhibition and the biodegradation and adsorption 
 of dasatinib was determined under aerobic conditions in an activated sludge respiration inhibition 
 study. altogether, the evaluation of pec/pnec ratios for surface water, groundwater and wastewater

 •</p></section><section><header>discussion on the non-clinical aspects</header><p>with ic50 values in the lower nm range, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of members of five tyrosine kinase families: src family kinases (src, lck, yes, fyn), bcr-abl, kit, epha2 and pdgfβ.</p><p>
 the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients. 
 dasatinib is rapidly absorbed in patients following oral administration, with peak concentrations 
 between 0.5-3 hours. following oral administration, the increase in the mean exposure (auc
 τ) is approximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg bid. 
 the overall mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is approximately 5-6 hours in patients.</p><p>data from healthy subjects administered a single, 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following a 
 high-fat meal indicated a 14% increase in the mean auc of dasatinib. a low-fat meal 30 minutes 
 prior to dasatinib resulted in a 21% increase in the mean auc of dasatinib. the observed food effects 
 do not represent clinically relevant changes in exposure. 
 in patients, dasatinib has a large apparent volume of distribution (2,505 l) suggesting that the 
 medicinal product is extensively distributed in the extravascular space. at clinically relevant 
 concentrations of dasatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 96% on the basis of 
 in vitro experiments.</p><p>dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans with multiple enzymes involved in the generation of 
 the metabolites. in healthy subjects administered 100 mg of [
 14c]-labelled dasatinib, unchanged dasatinib represented 29% of circulating radioactivity in plasma. plasma concentration and measured 
 in vitro activity indicate that metabolites of dasatinib are unlikely to play a major role in the observed pharmacology of the product. cyp3a4 is a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dasatinib. 
 elimination is predominantly in the faeces, mostly as metabolites. following a single oral dose of [
 14c]-labelled dasatinib, approximately 89% of the dose was eliminated within 10 days, with 4% and 85% of 
 the radioactivity recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. unchanged dasatinib accounted for 0.1% 
 and 19% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, with the remainder of the dose as metabolites. 
 dasatinib and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney. exposure to dasatinib may be 
 expected to increase if liver function is impaired.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 11/46 
 the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. the major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month 
 monkey study, animals were euthanized due to gi toxicity when exposed to clinically relevant 
 dasatinib plasma levels. in rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at 
 plasma exposure levels (auc) four-fold higher than observed in patients (70 mg bid). the 
 predominant causes of death in rats were gi and lymphoid toxicity. consistent gi findings were dose-
 related enteropathy, faecal abnormalities, vomiting, distension of the gi tract with gas/fluid/digesta 
 and gi tract haemorrhage 
 the haematology and clinical chemistry findings suggested inflammation, blood loss, poor food 
 consumption and electrolyte loss. the gi toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant auc levels. 
 bleeding is exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet 
 function erythroid toxicity was observed in the form of reduced erythrocytes, haemoglobin and 
 haematocrit counts. anaemia is a common finding in dasatinib-treated patients. lymphoid toxicity 
 was observed in the form of lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and an accompanying 
 reduction in thymus and spleen weight. in addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic t-
 cells and b-cells were observed in rats. hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a 
 dose giving rise to 4 to 6-fold higher auc values than observed in patients. all dasatinib-related 
 changes were generally reversible in surviving animals except for an increase in kidney 
 mineralization. 
 dasatinib was clastogenic in cho cells. the lowest nonclastogenic concentration of 2.5 
 µg/ml is approximately 50-fold greater than the maximum plasma concentration (c
 max) measured in humans given the recommended clinical dose of 70 mg bid. according to ich s1a, long-term 
 carcinogenicity studies are not required when the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short 
 (i.e. less than 2-3 years). consequently, the lack of carcinogenicity studies for dasatinib is justified. 
 considering the indication the lack of a fertility study is acceptable. administration of dasatinib to rats 
 during the period of organogenesis induced embryolethality at clinically relevant maternal plasma 
 exposures (auc). in addition, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal 
 toxicity in rats and rabbits at clinically relevant maternal plasma exposures.</p><p>
 the lack of a prenatal and postnatal development study is acceptable when considering the life-
 threatening indication. 
 dasatinib was phototoxic in the neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay and this is stated in the spc 
 section 5.3. dasatinib treatment inhibits t-cell activation and proliferation and causes reductions in 
 plasma lymphocytes and splenic t-cells and b-cells. immunotoxicty studies demonstrated that a 
 threshold exists for the dasatinib-induced immunosuppressive effect but based on the non-clinical 
 studies some immunotoxicity findings are expected in the clinic. dasatinib inhibited platelet 
 aggregation in human, monkey, and rat platelet-rich plasma 
 in vitro. the no-effect concentration of 0.05 µg/ml is equivalent to the plasma cmax measured in humans given the clinical dose of 70 mg bid. 
 in vivo, dasatinib in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding. in accordance with what has been reported for other src tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatanib potently 
 inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption when tested 
 in vitro and in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p>

 low with values ranging from 14% to 34%. the steady state volume of distribution of dasatinib in 
 mice, rats, dogs and monkeys was greater than the volume of total body water, suggesting 
 extravascular distribution of the drug. mean peak concentrations at the suggested clinical dose 
 regimen of 70 mg twice daily were observed between median tmax of 1.00 to 1.42 hours either in 
 healthy subjects or in leukaemia patients.</p><p>
 • distribution on the basis of in vitro studies at clinically relevant concentrations (100 and 500 ng/ml), binding of 
 dasatinib to serum proteins was approximately 96%. dasatinib distributes freely in human red blood 
 cells; the blood to plasma concentration ratio was 1.8. the vz/f after multiple dosing with the 
 proposed therapeutic dose of 70 mg q12h for 5 or 8 days was 2505 l. in animals, the absolute 
 bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% to 34%.</p><p>
 assuming the most conservative value of f in 
 humans (15.2%), vz corrected for oral bioavailability is calculated (0.152•vz/f) to be approximately 
 381 l. the apparent volume of distribution is about 9-fold greater than total body water suggesting an 
 extensive extravascular distribution in humans.</p><p>
 • metabolism</p><p>©emea 2006 page 14/46 
 in human liver microsomes, dasatinib inhibited cyp2a6 (ic50 = 35 µm), cyp2c8 (ic50 = 12 µm), cyp2c9 (ic
 50 = 50 µm), and cyp3a4 (ic50 values of 18 and 10 µm for midazolam and testosterone substrates, respectively).cyp2c8 inhibition by dasatinib followed a competitive inhibition model with 
 a k
 i of 3.6 µm. while none of the other enzymes tested showed any signs of time-dependent cyp 
 inhibition, cyp3a4 inhibition by dasatinib was time-dependent with a k
 i = 1.9µm. dasatinib has little potential to induce cyp3a4 and, at concentrations 
 ≤ 25 µm, dasatinib did not induce cyp1a2, 2b6, 2c9, and 3a4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. 
 the metabolism of 
 14c-dasatinib was investigated in vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans following po administration. unchanged dasatinib was the most abundant drug-related component in the plasma of 
 rats (34-55% at 1-8 h), monkeys (32% at 4 h), and humans (26% at 2 h). nevertheless studies 
 demonstrated, that dasatinib undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism and conjugation. in total 29 
 metabolites were detected. cyp3a4 appears to play a major role in dasatinib metabolism. dasatinib 
 treatment inhibited the activites of liver microsome cyp2c8 (ki of 3.6 
 µm) and cyp3a4 (ki = 1.9 µm). a cmax value of 0.12 µm has been reported in humans.</p><p> 
 • elimination following repeated doses of 70 mg orally administered dasatinib in the target population, the terminal 
 elimination half-life was 5.4 hours (sd3.5), and apparent oral clearance was 578 l/h (sd 537).</p><p>
 subjects eliminated radioactivity primarily in faeces. mean total recoveries of total radioactivity 
 through 9 days post-dose were approximately 4% and 85% in urine and faeces, respectively, with a 
 mean total of approximately 89%. negligible amounts of dasatinib and bms-606181 were excreted in 
 the urine (≤ 1% of dose) and approximately 19% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as dasatinib.</p><p>

 orally to patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) and 
 philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who have primary or acquired 
 haematologic resistance to or intolerance of imatinib mesylate. patients received the following dosing 
 regimens of dasatinib in the fasted state: 
 •</p><p>15, 30, 50, 75, 105, 140, or 180 mg once daily (15-180 mg/day) for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 non-treatment days every week (q5d regimen)

 • 35, 50, 70, 90, or 120 mg twice daily (70-240 mg/day) continuous dosing schedule (b7d regimen) 
 the auc of dasatinib is approximately dose proportional in the dose range of 15 to 240 mg/day. the 
 90% cis are wide, indicating that the variability in auc is high. similar results were obtained when 
 auc(tau) was analyzed separately for the q12h and qd regimens.</p><p>

 2.1 nm.</p><p>
 after adjusting for 
 protein binding, the ic50 of dasatinib in vivo is estimated to be in the range of 17.5 to 52.5 nm. on 
 the proposed 70 mg bid dosing regimen, the geometric mean cmax for dasatinib on day 5/8 is 2.4- to 
 7.4-fold higher than the in vivo protein binding adjusted ic50, and mean concentration is above the 
 protein-binding adjusted ic50 for 10 of 12 hours in each dosing interval. this compares with a mean 
 concentration that is above the target concentration for 4 of 12 hours on the 50 mg bid regimen, and 
 for 12 of 24 hours on the 140 mg qd regimen. 
 in study ca180002 (40 subjects were in chronic phase and 44 subjects had advanced disease), intra-
 subject dose escalation and schedule escalation were allowed in order to optimize an individual 
 subject’s haematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response while maintaining and evaluating safety, 
 tolerability, pharmacokinetics, bcr-abl mutation status, and dasatinib’s effect on specific 
 biomarkers. in this study, the majority (83%) of subjects were resistant to imatinib, and doses were 
 escalated from 15 mg qd to 180 mg qd (chronic phase), 25 mg bid to 90 mg bid (chronic phase), 
 and 35 mg bid to 120 mg bid (advanced phases). in all cohorts, haematologic and cytogenetic 
 responses were reported. 
 pharmacokinetic information showed that doses greater than 50 mg bid produced serum 
 concentrations of dasatinib above the level of the ic50 of in vitro growth inhibition assays. 
 pharmacodynamic information showed that phosphorylated crkl, a substrate of bcr-abl, was 
 inhibited over a greater period of time with the bid regimen than the qd regimen and provided a 
 rationale for the bid dosing regimen. although this study was not powered for a comparison between 
 dosing schedules, the bid and qd schedules in chronic phase showed no difference in efficacy 
 despite the pharmacodynamic data showing more prolonged bcr-abl inhibition with the bid 
 regimen.</p><p>
 a review of each subject’s dosing and the date a haematologic and cytogenetic response were noted 
 shows that most subjects (9 of 14 with ccyr) in chronic phase cml achieved a ccyr at doses of 100 
 - 140 mg total daily dose of dasatinib.</p><p>one subject achieved a ccyr at 50 mg qd of dasatinib who 
 was previously imatinib intolerant. three subjects achieved a ccyr at 70 - 75 mg total daily dose. no 
 one achieved a ccyr at 15 or 30 mg qd.</p><p>
 chr was achieved across doses ranging from 15 - 180 mg qd and from 25 - 70 mg bid. in 
 accelerated phase cml, chr was achieved at all dose levels ranging from 50 - 120 mg bid and 
 ccyr was achieved at the 70 mg bid (1 subject) and 120 mg bid (1 subject) dose levels only. in 
 blast phase cml, chr and nel were achieved in all dose levels ranging from 35 - 90 mg bid but in 
 no subject at 120 mg bid. in blast phase cml, ccyr was reported at doses ranging from 50 - 90 mg 
 bid. no ccyr was noted at 35 mg bid, 120 mg bid nor the majority of the 50 mg bid doses.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 16/46 
 although this trial was not designed to determine responses at each dose level and the majority of subjects (40 out of 84) began treatment with dasatinib at a total daily dose of 100 - 140 mg/day, 
 haematologic responses were noted in subjects taking 15 – 180 mg/day and most complete cytogenetic 
 responses occurred in subjects taking dasatinib doses in the 100 - 140 mg/day range, thus, a dose of 70 
 mg bid was concluded as a reasonable dose for phase 2 studies.</p><p>

 (2:1) to either dasatinib (70 mg bid) or imatinib (400 mg bid). crossover to the alternative treatment 
 arm was allowed if patients showed evidence of disease progression or intolerance that could not be 
 managed by dose modification. 
 updated results are available for 150 patients: 101 were randomised to sprycel and 49 to imatinib (all imatinib-resistant). the median time from diagnosis to

 introduced to highlight the observation that subjects achieving nel have a durability of response 
 similar to chr but may have some degree of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia due to a long history 
 of previous treatments for cml or all and thus do not meet the full criteria of chr. the definition

 the demonstration of efficacy in 481 subjects with chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast, and lymphoid 
 blast chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) and philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) acute 
 lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) resistant or intolerant to imatinib is based upon 6 studies, one phase i 
 and five pivotal phase ii (ca180005, ca180006, ca180013, ca180015, and ca180017).</p><p> 
 the efficacy of sprycel is based on haematological and cytogenetic response rates observed in all 
 phases of cml and in ph+ all. combined efficacy outcomes for all phase ii studies are shown 
 above in the table presented under ‘analysis performed across trials’. 
 in the phase i study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of cml and 
 in ph+ all in 84 patients and followed for up to 19 months. responses were durable across all phases 
 of cml and ph+ all.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>the total dasatinib safety cohort discussed in this document represents</p></section><section><header n="511">511 subjects</header><p>, and a breakdown of subjects is presented in the table below. these are the same 6 clinical studies of dasatinib treatment

 the majority of subjects (57%; n = 289) had a duration of between 3 and 6 months of treatment. thirty-two percent (n = 166) were treated for 3 months or less, and 11% (n = 56) were treated for 
 more than 6 months.</p><p>
 • adverse events</p><p>the majority of sprycel-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. most 
 reactions were of mild-to-moderate grade, but treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% 
 of patients in chronic phase cml, 5% in accelerated phase cml, 11% in myeloid blast phase cml, 
 and 6% in lymphoid blast phase cml or ph+ all. 
 the most frequently reported adverse reactions were fluid retention (including pleural effusion), 
 diarrhoea, skin rash, headache, haemorrhage, fatigue, nausea, and dyspnoea (table). drug-related 
 febrile neutropenia was reported in 4% of patients. 
 miscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and pericardial 
 effusion with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. the 
 use of dasatinib is associated with fluid</p><p>retention with severe cases in 7% of patients. severe pleural 
 and pericardial effusion were reported in 4% and &lt; 1% of patients, respectively. severe ascites and 
 generalised oedema were each reported in &lt; 1%. less than 1% of patients have had severe non-</p><p>cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care 
 measures that include diuretics or short courses of steroids. 
 bleeding drug-related events, ranging from petechiae and epistaxis to severe gastrointestinal 
 haemorrhage and cns bleeding, were reported in patients taking sprycel. severe cns 
 haemorrhage occurred in &lt; 1% of patients; 3 cases were fatal and two of them were associated with 
 ctc grade 4 thrombocytopenia. severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients and 
 generally required treatment interruption and transfusions. other severe haemorrhage occurred in 2% 
 of patients. most bleeding related events were typically associated with severe thrombocytopenia. 
 in clinical trials, it was recommended that treatment with imatinib be discontinued at least 7 days 
 before starting treatment with sprycel.</p><p>

 depending on the stage of the disease 40-75%% of subjects with no abnormalities at baseline 
 developed some degree of hypocalcemia at least once during the study, none of the subjects developed 
 clinical symptoms, but care should be taken regarding possible interactions with other drugs causing 
 hypocalcemia.</p><p>
 • safety in special populations no meaningful differences, regardless of disease phase, in overall incidence of aes, saes, or aes 
 leading to discontinuation based on age, gender or ecog performance status were observed. 
 the majority of subjects with chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast, and lymphoid blast cml and ph+ 
 all were white. based on the limited number of subjects enrolled in other race categories, no 
 clinically meaningful comparisons can be made based on race. 
 of the 59 imatinib-intolerant subjects in study ca180013 (chronic cml), 41 subjects (69%) had no 
 recurrence of the toxicity that caused intolerance to imatinib. eighteen (31%) subjects experienced 
 toxicities while on treatment with dasatinib that were similar to what they had experienced while 
 receiving prior imatinib. eight (8) subjects experienced similar non-hematologic toxicities to those 
 reported while on prior imatinib: 3 toxicities of the gastrointestinal system, 1 pulmonary, 2 skin, and 2 
 general (1 fatigue and 1 severe cramps). 
 dasatinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. it is not known whether 
 dasatinib is excreted in human milk; therefore women who are taking dasatinib should not breast-feed. 
 the potential effects of dasatinib on sperm have not been studied.</p><p>
 • safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions dasatinib is metabolized primarily by cyp3a4 isoenzyme and, based on in vitro cytochrome p-450 
 [cyp] inhibition studies, is an inhibitor of cyp3a4.</p><p>
 therefore coadministration of dasatinib with substances that inhibit cyp3a4 activity (eg, 
 ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, retrovir, atazanavir, and lopinavir) may increase dasatinib 
 plasma concentrations. results of an ongoing study in adult cancer subjects (ca180021) is expected 
 to deliver further information.</p><p>since dasatinib is a cyp3a4 substrate, the effect of rifampin, a potent cyp3a4 inducer, on the pk of 
 dasatinib was investigated (ca180032). marked decreases in exposure parameters were noted when 
 dasatinib was co-administered with rifampin compared with dasatinib given alone. the mean cmax 
 and auc of dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively.</p><p>
 another study investigated the effects of antacid coadministration on the dasatinib pk (ca180020). 
 concomitant administration of aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide products resulted in a</p><p>©emea 2006 page 40/46 
 55% reduction in dasatinib auc, and a 58% reduction in cmax. dasatinib may be administered with otc antacids (aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide products) if the doses are temporally 
 separated by at least 2 hours. 
 exposure to dasatinib was decreased when administered up to 10 hours following famotidine 
 (ca180020). area under the curve and cmax were reduced by 61% and 63%, respectively. thus, 
 administration of dasatinib with drugs that reduce gastric acid secretion (eg, famotidine, omeprazole) 
 are likely to reduce dasatinib exposure.</p><p>
 since dasatinib is a potential inhibitor of cyp3a4, the effect of dasatinib on the pk of simvastatin, a 
 cyp3a4 substrate, was investigated (ca180022). the results of this study indicate that simvastatin 
 exposure is increased when it is administered in combination with dasatinib; cmax and auc were 
 increased by 36.9% and 19.8%, respectively. therefore, caution is warranted when dasatinib is 
 administered with cyp3a4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic margin (eg, cyclosporine). 
 dasatinib does not inhibit the following cytochrome p450 enzymes in vitro: cyp1a2, cyp2a6, 
 cyp2b6, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, and cyp2e1.</p><p>
 • discontinuation due to adverse events in study180002 (phase i) of the 34 subjects who discontinued, 10 subjects (6 myeloid blast, 4 
 lymphoid blast/ph+ all,</p><p>
 respectively) reported adverse events that led to discontinuation. however, 
 for all of these 10 subjects, the reported reason for study discontinuation was: disease progression (8 
 subjects), rapid progression of solid cancer (1 subject) or resistant mutation. in all cases, the adverse 
 events that led to discontinuation were considered by the investigator as unrelated to dasatinib. 
 in study ca180013 (chronic cml) thirteen (7%) subjects discontinued study drug (10 imatinib-
 resistant and 3 imatinib-intolerant) because of aes of moderate to severe intensity: 
 -grade 2 events in 4 cases: (i) neuropathy, (ii) qtc prolongation, (iii) pulmonary edema, and (iv) atrial 
 fibrillation 
 -grade 3 events in 5 cases: (i) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, (ii) bone pain, (iii) pyoderma 
 gangrenosum, (iv) erythema, and (v) pneumonia 
 -grade 4 in 2 cases: (i) rhabdomyolysis, and (ii) thrombocytopenia 
 -grade 5 (or death) in 2 cases: (i) cns hemorrhage, and (ii) severe renal failure. 
 most discontinuations (10 subjects, 5%) were considered by the investigator(s) to be certainly, 
 possibly, or probably related to dasatinib. 
 in study ca180005 (accelerated cml) five imatinib-resistant subjects experienced aes that led to 
 discontinuation
 . 
 one subject died (sudden death due to shock), which was considered by the 
 investigator as not related to dasatinib. two subjects discontinued due to progressive disease, both 
 considered not related to study treatment; 1 subject due to dyspnea and 1 subject due to pulmonary 
 embolism, both designated as not likely related to study treatment. one additional subject discontinued 
 30 days after the last dose of study therapy due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which was considered 
 probably related to study treatment. 
 in study ca180006 (myeloid blast cml) twenty (27%) subjects experienced adverse events which led 
 to discontinuation. most aes that led to discontinuation were grades 3 to 5. the most common ae 
 leading to medication discontinuation was disease progression. dasatinib-related aes led to 
 discontinuation in 4 subjects. three of these subjects had &quot;study drug toxicity&quot; as a reason for 
 discontinuation on the end of treatment crf. one had &quot;disease progression&quot; as the reason for 
 discontinuing. 
 in study ca180015 (lymphoid blast cml and ph+ all) adverse events leading to discontinuation 
 regardless of causality occurred in 32 (36%) subjects with lymphoid blast cml or ph+ all
 . 
 most 
 aes that led to discontinuation were grade 3 or greater. the most common aes leading to treatment 
 discontinuation were worsening of disease and blast crisis. all other aes leading to discontinuation 
 occurred in no more than 2% of subjects.</p><p>
 among all subjects with aes leading to discontinuation, an attribution of a potential drug relationship 
 occurred in a total of 3 (3%) subjects. one subject discontinued because of severe dyspnea, another 
 discontinued because of a severe lung infiltrates, and the last subject discontinued with a severe rash 
 and an exanthema.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 41/46</p><p>• post marketing experience n/a</p><p>
 • discussion on clinical safety the most frequently reported (≥ 10%) non hematologic aes included gastrointestinal aes (diarrhea 
 [32%], nausea [19%], and vomiting [13%]), fluid retention events (peripheral edema [15%] and 
 pleural effusion [14%]), headache (23%), fatigue (18%), asthenia (14%), rash (14%), dyspnea (14%), 
 and pyrexia (13%). the majority of adverse events were considered to be drug-related (roughly 50-
 90%), except for adverse events leading to drug discontinuations (roughly 0-25% considered as drug-
 related), where there was a notable difference.</p><p>
 important identified risks are toxicity regarding the gastrointestinal system and fluid retention. 
 approximately 14% of subjects in the dasatinib program experienced a pleural effusion considered 
 related to dasatinib. fluid retention seems usually manageable. 
 hemorrhage occurred in one-third of subjects treated with dasatinib, the majority of the events were 
 manageable.</p><p>
 important missing information is long-term safety data on the treatment with dasatinib. 
 one out of 71 deaths in study ca180006 and ca180015 was considered to be caused by study drug 
 toxicity. the number of deaths due to study drugs toxicity seems to be underestimated taking the 
 toxicity of dasatinib into consideration (e.g. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia).</p><p>
 the majority of the saes were related to the respiratory system (5-15%), gastrointestinal disorders (2-
 14%) and cardiac disorders (1- 7%). a general pattern of saes depending on the stage of the disease 
 was not identified. 
 the majority of patients in all studies with grade 0 absolute neutrophil counts (anc) at baseline 
 developed hematological toxicity with increasing severity related to advanced stages of the disease.</p><p>
 similar results were observed regarding thrombocytopenia of patients with grade 0 at baseline 
 developing grade 3-4 toxicities 
 the time to the first occurrence of severe (grade 3-4) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia usually ranged 
 from 0-8 weeks, 25-30% of neutropenias in chronic and accelerated cml were observed after 8 
 weeks.</p><p>
 overall toxicity to dasatinib is rated to be manageable. considerable toxicity has been observed 
 regarding cytopenia (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and fluid retention. 
 concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that potently inhibit cyp3a4 (e.g. ketoconazole, 
 itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib. 
 therefore, in patients receiving sprycel, coadministration of a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor is not 
 recommended.</p><p>
 concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that induce cyp3a4 (e.g. dexamethasone, 
 phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or 
 hypericum perforatum, also known as st. john&apos;s wort) may substantially reduce exposure to dasatinib, potentially increasing the risk of 
 therapeutic failure. therefore, in patients receiving sprycel, coadministration of alternative 
 therapeutic agents with less potential for cyp3a4 induction should be selected (see section 4.5). 
 concomitant use of dasatinib and a cyp3a4 substrate may increase exposure to the cyp3a4 
 substrate. therefore, caution is warranted when sprycel is coadministered with cyp3a4 substrates 
 of narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
 or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)</p><p>
 the concomitant use of dasatinib and a h
 2 blocker (e.g. famotidine), proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), or aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide may reduce the exposure to dasatinib. 
 thus, h
 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended and aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide products should be administered up to 2 hours prior to, or 2 hours 
 following the administration of dasatinib. these issues are addressed in the smpc section 4.5.</p><p>there are currently no data available from clinical trials with sprycel in patients with moderately to 
 severely impaired liver function. caution is recommended when administering sprycel to patients 
 with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. this is mentioned in the spc 4.2. 
 hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to sprycel administration. 
 patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease were not included in the clinical 
 studies.</p><p> ©emea 2006 page 42/46

 the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients. 
 dasatinib is rapidly absorbed in patients following oral administration, with peak concentrations 
 between 0.5-3 hours. following oral administration, the increase in the mean exposure (auc
 τ) is approximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg bid.</p><p>
 the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeat-
 dose toxicity studies. the major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month 
 monkey study, animals were euthanized due to gi toxicity when exposed to clinically relevant 
 dasatinib plasma levels. in rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at 
 plasma exposure levels (auc) four-fold higher than observed in patients (70 mg bid). the 
 predominant causes of death in rats were gi and lymphoid toxicity. consistent gi findings were dose-
 related enteropathy, faecal abnormalities, vomiting, distension of the gi tract with gas/fluid/digesta 
 and gi tract haemorrhage 
 the haematology and clinical chemistry findings suggested inflammation, blood loss, poor food 
 consumption and electrolyte loss. the gi toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant auc levels. 
 bleeding is exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet 
 function erythroid toxicity was observed in the form of reduced erythrocytes, haemoglobin and 
 haematocrit counts. anaemia is a common finding in dasatinib-treated patients. lymphoid toxicity 
 was observed in the form of lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and an accompanying 
 reduction in thymus and spleen weight. in addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic t-
 cells and b-cells were observed in rats. hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a 
 dose giving rise to 4 to 6-fold higher auc values than observed in patients. all dasatinib-related 
 changes were generally reversible in surviving animals except for an increase in kidney 
 mineralization. 
 dasatinib was clastogenic in cho cells. the lowest nonclastogenic concentration of 2.5 
 µg/ml is approximately 50-fold greater than the maximum plasma concentration (c
 max) measured in humans given the recommended clinical dose of 70 mg bid. according to ich s1a, long-term 
 carcinogenicity studies are not required when the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short 
 (i.e. less than 2-3 years). consequently, the lack of carcinogenicity studies for dasatinib is justified. 
 considering the indication the lack of a fertility study is acceptable. administration of dasatinib to rats 
 during the period of organogenesis induced embryolethality at clinically relevant maternal plasma 
 exposures (auc). in addition, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal 
 toxicity in rats and rabbits at clinically relevant maternal plasma exposures.</p><p>
 the lack of a prenatal and postnatal development study is acceptable when considering the life-
 threatening indication. 
 dasatinib was phototoxic in the neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay and this is stated in the spc 
 section 5.3. dasatinib treatment inhibits t-cell activation and proliferation and causes reductions in 
 plasma lymphocytes and splenic t-cells and b-cells. immunotoxicty studies demonstrated that a 
 threshold exists for the dasatinib-induced immunosuppressive effect but based on the non-clinical 
 studies some immunotoxicity findings are expected in the clinic. dasatinib inhibited platelet 
 aggregation in human, monkey, and rat platelet-rich plasma 
 in vitro. the no-effect concentration of 0.05 µg/ml is equivalent to the plasma cmax measured in humans given the clinical dose of 70 mg bid. 
 in vivo, dasatinib in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding.</p><p>©emea 2006 page 45/46 
 in accordance with what has been reported for other src tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatanib potently inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption when tested 
 in vitro and in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p>

 glivec (imatinib) which is authorised for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication for 
 sprycel (dasatinib).</p><p>
 the chmp, having considered the arguments presented by the applicant, the rapporteurs similarity 
 assessment, and the conclusions of the quality working party, concluded that there are substantial 
 differences in the molecular structure of the two active substances.</p><p>
 the chmp concluded that dasatinib and imatinib are not similar in terms of molecular structural 
 aspects. both molecular structures contain an n-phenyl-amide, a piperazine ring and a pyrimidin ring, 
 but the interconnections between these moieties do not indicate that the two molecules share a 
 common framework such as structural analogues. despite the presence of some common structural 
 features, it was concluded that this is not enough to comply with the definition of structural similarity 
 in the legislation. the overall structural differences were regarded as major, not minor.</p><p>
 the chmp is therefore of the opinion that sprycel is not similar to glivec within the meaning of 
 article 3 of commission regulation (ec) no. 847/200.</p><p>
 aditionally the applicant claimed during the</p><p>evaluation procedure</p><p>that sprycel is not similar (as 
 defined in art. 3 of commission regulation (ec) no 847/2000) to the authorised orphan medicinal 
 product evoltra (clofarabine) , which is authorized for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic 
 indication for sprycel (dasatinib). the chmp, having considered the arguments presented by the 
 applicant, the rapporteurs assessment, and the conclusions of the quality working party, concluded 
 that there are substantial differences in the molecular structure of the two active substances.</p><p>
 the chmp concluded that dasatinib and clofarabine are not similar in terms of molecular structural 
 aspects since the molecular structural of dasatinib is not similar to clofarabine on the basis of the 
 difference in principal molecular structural features.</p><p>
