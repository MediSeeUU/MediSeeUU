 4.1
 therapeutic indications</header><p>treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) classified as who functional class iii, to improve exercise capacity. efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and in 
 pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of pah. thelin is to be taken orally as a dose of 100 mg once daily. it may be taken with or without food and 
 without regard to the time of day.
 in the case of clinical deterioration despite thelin treatment for at least 12 weeks, alternative therapies 
 should be considered. however, a number of patients who showed no response by week 12 of 
 treatment with thelin responded favourably by week 24, so an additional 12 weeks of treatment may 
 be considered.
 higher doses did not confer additional benefit sufficient to offset the increased risk of adverse 
 reactions, particularly liver injury (see section 4.4). 
 discontinuation of treatment
 there is limited experience with abrupt discontinuation of sitaxentan sodium. no evidence for acute 
 rebound has been observed.
 dosage in hepatic impairment:
 studies in patients with pre-existing liver impairment have not been conducted. thelin is 
 contraindicated in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases prior to initiation of treatment 
 (&gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (uln)) or with elevated direct bilirubin &gt; 2 x uln prior to initiation of 
 treatment (see section 4.3).
 dosage in renal impairment:
 no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
 3use in children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years).thelin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on 
 safety and efficacy.
 elderly patients:
 no dosage adjustment is needed in patients over the age of 65 years.
 use in patients using other medicines:
 the efficacy and safety of thelin co-administration with other treatments for pah (eg, epoprostenol, 
 sildenafil, iloprost) has not been studied in controlled clinical trials. therefore, caution is 
 recommended in case of co-administration.</p></section><section><header>4.3contraindications</header><p>hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.mild to severe hepatic impairment (child-pugh class a-c).

 lactation (see section 4.6).</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and precautions for use</header><p>the efficacy of thelin as monotherapy has not been established in patients with nyha/who functional class iv pah. transfer to a therapy that is recommended at the severe stage of the disease 
 (eg, epoprostenol) should be considered if the clinical condition deteriorates (see section 4.2).
 liver function:
 liver function abnormalities have been associated with pah. endothelin receptor antagonists, as a 
 class, have been associated with liver function abnormalities.
 elevations of ast and/or alt associated with thelin occur both early and late in treatment, usually 
 progress slowly, and are typically asymptomatic. during clinical trials, these changes were usually 
 reversible when monitoring and discontinuation guidelines were followed. liver aminotransferase 
 elevations may reverse spontaneously while continuing treatment with sitaxentan sodium.
 the mechanism of liver toxicity is not fully documented and it might vary between endothelin 
 receptor antagonists. appropriate care should be exercised when initiating sitaxentan in patients who 
 discontinued other endothelin receptor antagonists due to liver enzyme abnormalities (see section 4.8).
 because treatment-associated elevations of ast and/or alt are a marker for potential serious liver 
 injury, liver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and subsequently 
 at monthly intervals.</p><p>if ast and/or alt are &gt; 3 x uln prior to initiation of therapy, or direct 
 bilirubin is &gt; 2 x uln, use of sitaxentan is contraindicated (see section 4.3)
 recommendations in case of treatment-emergent alt/ast elevations:
 if alt/ast measurements rise to the following levels then changes to the monitoring or treatment are 
 given:
 4&gt;3 and ≤ 5 x uln: confirm by another liver test;</p><p>if confirmed, a decision should be made on an individual basis to continue or to stop thelin administration.</p><p>continue to monitor aminotransferases 
 at least every 2 weeks.</p><p>if the aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values, consider 
 resuming the initial treatment schedule according to the conditions described below. 
 &gt; 5 and ≤ 8 x uln: confirm by another liver test; if confirmed, stop treatment and monitor 
 aminotransferase levels at least every 2 weeks until levels have normalised.</p><p>if the aminotransferase 
 levels return to pre-treatment values, consider reintroducing thelin according to the conditions 
 described below.
 &gt;8 x uln: treatment must be stopped and reintroduction of thelin is not to be considered. 
 if liver transferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, 
 vomiting, anorexia, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in 
 total bilirubin &gt; 2x uln, treatment should be stopped and re-introduction of thelin is not to be 
 considered.
 re-introduction of treatment:
 re-introduction of treatment with thelin should only be considered if the potential benefits of 
 treatment with thelin outweigh the potential risks and when liver aminotransferase levels are within 
 pre-treatment values. the advice of a hepatologist is recommended. re-introduction must follow the 
 guidelines detailed in section 4.2. aminotransferase levels must then be checked within 3 days after 
 re-introduction, then again after a further 2 weeks, and thereafter according to the recommendations 
 above.
 pre-existing liver impairment
 studies in patients with pre-existing liver impairment have not been conducted. thelin is 
 contraindicated in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases prior to initiation of treatment 
 (&gt; 3 x uln), or with elevated direct bilirubin &gt; 2 x uln prior to initiation of treatment, see section 
 4.3.
 bleeding
 there is an increased risk of bleeding with thelin, mainly in the form of epistaxis and gingival 
 bleeding.
 vitamin k antagonists
 thelin increases the plasma levels of vitamin k antagonists such as warfarin, acenocoumarol and 
 fenprocoumon (see section 4.5).
 drugs which inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (oatp)
 the extent of interaction with potent oatp inhibitors (e.g. some statins, proteinase inhibitors, 
 tuberculostatics) is unknown. as this could result in raised plasma levels of sitaxentan sodium, 
 patients in need of the combination should be closely monitored for adverse events related to 
 sitaxentan sodium (see section 4.5).
 oral contraceptive agents
 thelin increases oestrogen exposure when given concomitantly with oral contraceptive agents (see 
 section 4.5). therefore, especially in women who smoke, there is an increased risk for 
 thromboembolism.</p><p>given a theoretical higher risk for thromboembolism, traditional concomitant use 
 of vitamin k antagonists should be considered.
 pregnancy
 due to possible teratogenicity, thelin must not be initiated in women of child-bearing potential unless 
 they practise reliable contraception. if necessary, pregnancy testing should be undertaken (see section 
 4.6).
 pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (pvod) 
 5no data are available with thelin in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. however, cases of life threatening pulmonary oedema have been reported with 
 vasodilators (mainly prostacyclin) when used in those patients. consequently, should signs of 
 pulmonary oedema occur when thelin is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the 
 possibility of associated veno-occlusive disease should be considered.
 haemoglobin concentration
 treatment with thelin was associated with a dose-related decrease in haemoglobin (see section 4.8).
 most of this decrease of haemoglobin concentration was detected during the first few weeks of 
 treatment and haemoglobin levels stabilized by 4 weeks of thelin treatment. it is recommended that 
 haemoglobin concentrations be checked prior to treatment</p></section><section><header>,</header><p>after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. if a marked decrease in haemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be 
 undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment.
 excipients
 thelin tablets contain lactose monohydrate. patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
 intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
 medicine.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>sitaxentan sodium is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome p450 cyp2c9 and cyp3a4/5 isoenzymes. sitaxentan sodium is an inhibitor of cyp2c9 and, to a lesser extent, cyp2c19, 
 cyp3a4/5 and cyp2c8. plasma concentrations of drugs principally metabolized by cyp2c9 may be 
 increased during sitaxentan sodium co-administration. co-administration with drugs metabolized by 
 cyp2c19 or cyp3a4/5 is not expected to result in clinically significant drug interactions. sitaxentan 
 sodium does not affect the p-glycoprotein transporter, but it is postulated to be a substrate of oatp 
 transporter proteins.
 effects of other medicinal products on thelin</p></section><section><header>organic anion transporting polypeptides (oatp) inhibitors:</header><p>co-administration with ciclosporin a, a potent oatp inhibitor, resulted in a 6-fold increase in c
 min and a 67% increase in auc of sitaxentan therefore the use of thelin in patients receiving systemic ciclosporin a is contraindicated 
 (see section 4.3). clearance of ciclosporin a was unchanged. 
 the extent of interaction with other oatp inhibitors (some hmg coa reductase inhibitors eg,
 atorvastatin, protease inhibitors eg, ritonavir, tuberculostatics eg, rifamycin) is unknown but could 
 result in raised plasma levels of sitaxentan. the clinical significance of this is unknown. patients in 
 need of the combination should be closely monitored. moreover, clinical interaction studies with 
 nelfinavir, a moderately potent oatp inhibitor, and pravastatin, a low affinity oatp inhibitor, did not 
 result in clinically significant changes in sitaxentan plasma levels.</p></section><section><header>fluconazole</header><p>(inhibitor of cyp2c19, cyp2c9 and cyp3a4/5): co-administration of thelin and fluconazole had no effect on the clearance of sitaxentan sodium.</p></section><section><header>ketoconazole</header><p>(substrate and inhibitor of cyp3a4/5): co-administration with thelin did not cause a clinically significant change in the clearance of either sitaxentan sodium or ketoconazole.</p></section><section><header>nelfinavir</header><p>(substrate of cyp3a4/5, cyp2c19): co-administration with thelin did not cause a clinically significant change in the clearance of either sitaxentan sodium or nelfinavir. the clearance 
 of nelfinavir was not clinically significantly changed in one subject that was classified as a cyp2c19 
 poor metaboliser.
 effects of thelin on other medicinal products</p></section><section><header>warfarin</header><p>(vitamin k antagonist, substrate of cyp2c9): concomitant treatment with sitaxentan 6sodium resulted in a 2.4 fold increase in s-warfarin exposure. subjects receiving warfarin achieve therapeutic anticoagulation (international normalised ratio [inr] target) with lower doses of the 
 anticoagulant in the presence of sitaxentan sodium. it is expected that a similar increase in 
 anticoagulant effect will be seen with warfarin analogues, including acenocoumarol, fenprocoumon 
 and fluindione. when initiating vitamin k antagonist therapy in a patient taking sitaxentan sodium, it 
 is recommended to start at the lowest available dose. in patients already taking a vitamin k antagonist, 
 it is recommended that the dose of the vitamin k antagonist be reduced when starting sitaxentan 
 sodium. in all cases, inr should be monitored on a regular schedule. increases in the vitamin k 
 antagonist dose should be done in small increments to reach an appropriate target inr. if inr is not 
 properly monitored and increased exposure to vitamin k antagonists remains undetected, severe or 
 life-threatening bleeding episodes may occur.</p></section><section><header>oral contraceptives</header><p> (substrate of cyp3a4/5): concomitant administration of thelin and ortho-novum 1/35 (1 mg norethindrone/ 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol) resulted in increases in exposure to 
 ethinyl estradiol (substrate of cyp3a4/5) and norethindrone (cyp3a4/5) of 59 % and 47%, 
 respectively. however, sitaxentan sodium did not affect the anti-ovulatory activity of the oral 
 contraceptive as assessed by the plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (fsh), 
 luteinising hormone (lh), and progesterone (see section 4.4).</p></section><section><header>sildenafil</header><p>(substrate of cyp3a4): a single dose of sildenafil 100 mg coadministered with thelin increased c
 max and auc∞ of sildenafil by 18% and 28%, respectively. there was no change in cmax or auc for the active metabolite, n-desmethylsildenafil. these changes in sildenafil plasma 
 concentrations were not considered clinically significant. interaction with sildenafil may be serious if 
 hypotension occurs beyond a safe level. study results suggest that the dose of sildenafil does not need 
 to be adjusted during concomitant administration with sitaxentan sodium.</p></section><section><header>nifedipine</header><p>(substrate of cyp3a4/5): the clearance of nifedipine was not clinically significantly changed when given concomitantly with thelin. this was tested for low-dose nifedipine only. 
 therefore, at higher doses of nifedipine, an increase in exposure cannot be excluded.</p></section><section><header>omeprazole</header><p>(substrate of cyp2c19): concomitant administration of thelin with omeprazole increased the omeprazole auc0-24 by 30%; c
 max was unchanged. the change in auc was not considered clinically significant.</p></section><section><header>digoxin</header><p>(substrate of p-glycoprotein): concomitant administration of thelin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin indicating no effect on the p-glycoprotein transporter</p><p>
 no clinical interaction study was performed with a substrate of cyp 2c8. therefore an interaction 
 with such a drug cannot be excluded.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>pregnancythere are no human data regarding the use of sitaxentan sodium during pregnancy. sitaxentan sodium 
 caused teratogenicity in rats (see section 5.3). potential effects in humans are unknown. thelin should 
 not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary ie, in case no alternative treatment options are 
 available.
 lactation
 sitaxentan sodium was detected in the plasma of breast fed pups from female rats treated with 
 sitaxentan sodium, indicating that sitaxentan sodium was present in the breast milk. it is unknown 
 whether or not sitaxentan sodium is excreted into human milk. women should not breastfeed while 
 using thelin.
 7women of child-bearing potentialtreatment must not be initiated in women of child-bearing potential unless they practice reliable 
 contraception, due to possible teratogenicity. if necessary, pregnancy testing should be undertaken.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. a knownundesirable effect is dizziness, which could influence the ability to drive or use machines.</p></section><section><header>4.8undesirable effects</header><p>general description safety of thelin has been evaluated in clinical trials of more than 1200 patients with pah, as well as 
 post-marketing safety data. at the recommended dose during placebo-controlled trials in pulmonary 
 arterial hypertension pah, the most common adverse drug reactions considered to be at least possibly 
 related to thelin treatment were headache in 15% of patients, and peripheral oedema and nasal 
 congestion, each in 9% of patients.
 within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
 frequencies are reported as

 elevations of ast and/or alt are associated with sitaxentan sodium. in phase 2 and 3 oral studies in 
 patients with pah, elevations in alt and/or ast &gt; 3 uln were observed in 5% of placebo-treated 
 patients (n = 155) and 7% of thelin 100 mg-treated patients (n = 887). elevations in alt values &gt; 5 
 uln were 4% (36/887) for sitaxentan 100 mg qd and 0.6% in the placebo group (1/155).
 the sitaxentan population also included patients (n = 53) who had discontinued another endothelin 
 receptor antagonist due to liver function abnormalities.</p><p>this specific group had a higher risk (19%;</p><p>
 n = 10/53) of developing elevations in alt and/or ast &gt; 3 x uln indicating that appropriate care 
 should be exercised when initiating sitaxentan in this patient population.
 decreased haemoglobin (see section 4.4)
 the overall mean decrease in haemoglobin concentration for thelin -treated patients was 0.5 g/dl 
 (change to end of treatment). in placebo-controlled studies, marked decreases in haemoglobin (&gt; 15% 
 decrease from baseline with value &lt; lower limit of normal) were observed in 7% of patients treated 
 with thelin (n = 149) and 3% of placebo-treated patients (n = 155). a decrease in haemoglobin 
 concentration by at least 1 g/dl was observed in 60% of patients treated with thelin as compared to 
 32% of placebo-treated patients.
 post marketing experience
 adverse events reported during the post-marketing period to date have been similar to those reported 
 in clinical trials. cases of concurrent elevations of transaminases (alt and/or ast) &gt; 8 x uln and 
 total bilirubin &gt; 2 x uln have been reported following administration of sitaxentan sodium.</p><p>this may 
 lead to hepatic failure, which can be fatal, and highlights the need for regular monitoring of 
 transaminases and bilirubin.</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>there is no specific experience with the management of thelin overdose. in the event of overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed.
 during clinical trials, thelin was given as a daily oral dose of 1000 mg/day for 7 days to healthy 
 volunteers. the most common adverse effects at this dose were headache, nausea, and vomiting.
 in an open-label hypertension study, 10 patients received 480 mg twice daily (approximately a 10-fold 
 increase in daily dose compared to the mrhd) for up to 2 weeks. headaches (some severe), 
 9peripheral oedema, and anaemias were the most common adverse events reported in these patients, none of which were considered serious.
 in an open-label pah study, one fatal case of hepatic failure has been reported after chronic dosing of 
 sitaxentan at 600 mg/day administered as 300 mg bid.</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1 
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: other antihypertensives, atc code: c02kx03mechanism of action
 endothelin-1 (et-1) is a potent vascular paracrine and autocrine peptide in the lung, and can also 
 promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, and remodelling and is pro-inflammatory. 
 et-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial 
 hypertension (pah), as well as other cardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, 
 including scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension, 
 and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of et-1 in these diseases. in pah and heart failure, 
 in the absence of endothelin receptor antagonism, elevated et-1 concentrations are strongly correlated 
 with the severity and prognosis of these diseases. additionally, pah also is characterized by reduced 
 nitric oxide activity.
 et-1 actions are mediated through endothelin a receptors (eta), present on smooth muscle cells, and 
 endothelin b receptors (etb), present on endothelial cells. predominant actions of et-1 binding to 
 eta are vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling, while binding to etb results in et-1 clearance, 
 and vasodilatory/ antiproliferative effects due in part to nitric oxide and prostacyclin release.
 thelin is a potent (ki 0.43 nm) and highly selective eta antagonist (approximately 6,500-fold more 
 selective for eta as compared to etb).
 efficacy
 two randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trials were conducted to demonstrate 
 efficacy. stride-1, which included 178 patients, compared 2 oral doses of thelin (100 mg once daily 
 and 300 mg once daily) with placebo during 12 weeks of treatment. the 18 week stride-2 trial, 
 conducted in 246 patients, included 4 treatment arms: placebo once daily, thelin 50 mg once daily, 
 thelin 100 mg once daily, and open-label bosentan twice daily (efficacy-rater blinded, administered 
 according to the approved package insert).
 stride-4 included 98 patients randomised to sitaxentan sodium 50 mg, 100 mg, and placebo once 
 daily for 18 weeks. efficacy endpoints included sub maximal exercise capacity, who functional 
 class and time to clinical worsening for all studies, and haemodynamics for stride-1.
 patients had moderate to severe (nyha/who functional class ii-iv) pah resulting from idiopathic 
 pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah, also known as primary pulmonary hypertension), connective 
 tissue disease (ctd), or congenital heart disease (chd).
 in these studies, the study medicine was added to patients’ current therapy, which could have included 
 a combination of digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, oxygen, and vasodilators (eg, calcium channel 
 blockers, ace inhibitors). patients with pre-existent hepatic disease and patients using non-
 conventional pah treatments (eg, iloprost) were excluded.
 sub-maximal exercise capacity: this was assessed by measuring distance walked in 6 minutes (6-minute walk test) at 12 weeks for stride-1 and 18 weeks for stride-2 and stride-4. in both 
 stride-1 and stride-2 trials, treatment with thelin resulted in a significant increase in exercise 
 capacity. the placebo-corrected increases in walk distance in the whole cohort compared to baseline 
 10were 35 metres (p = 0.006; ancova) and 31 metres (p &lt; 0.05; ancova), respectively. in stride-4, a statistically non-significant placebo-corrected mean improvement of 24.3 metres (p = 
 0.2078) was observed in the whole cohort. among patients with pah associated with ctd in 
 stride-1 and stride-2, a statistically significant difference versus placebo was observed 
 (37.73 metres, p &lt; 0.05).
 haemodynamic parameters: these were assessed in stride-1 for both functional class ii and iii patients. compared with placebo treatment, thelin resulted in statistically significant improvement in 
 pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) and cardiac index (ci) after 12 weeks of treatment (see below).</p></section><section><header>treatment comparison of change from baseline in pvr, and ci at week 12 by functional class – stride 1: sitaxentan 100 mg versus placebo

 functional class: a reduction in symptoms of pah were observed with sitaxentan sodium 100 mg treatment. improvements in functional class were observed across all studies (stride-1, stride-2 
 &amp; stride-4). 
 long-term survival:there are no randomised studies to demonstrate beneficial effects on survival of treatment with sitaxentan sodium. however, patients completing stride-2 were eligible to enrol in 
 open-label studies (stride-2x and stride-3). a total of 145 patients were treated with sitaxentan 
 sodium 100 mg and their long term survival status was assessed for a minimum of 3 years. in this total 
 population, kaplan-meier estimates of 1, 2 and 3 year survival were 96%, 85% and 78% respectively.
 these survival estimates were similar in the subgroup of patients with pah associated with ctd for 
 the thelin treated group (98%, 78% and 67% respectively). the estimates may have been influenced 
 by the initiation of new or additional pah therapies, which occurred in 24% of patients at one year.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>absorption sitaxentan sodium is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. in pah patients, peak plasma 
 concentrations are generally achieved within 1-4 hours. the absolute bioavailability of thelin is 
 between 70 and 100%.</p><p>when administered with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption (c

 distribution
 sitaxentan sodium is more than 99% protein bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. the 
 degree of binding is independent of concentration in the clinically relevant range. sitaxentan sodium 
 does not penetrate into erythrocytes and does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier.
 metabolism and elimination
 following oral administration to healthy volunteers, sitaxentan sodium is highly metabolised. the 
 most common metabolic products are at least 10 times less potent as et
 a antagonists than sitaxentan 11sodium in a standard in vitro test of activity. in vitro, sitaxentan sodium is metabolized by cyp2c9 and cyp3a4/5. 
 in vitro studies using human liver microsomes or primary hepatocytes show that sitaxentan sodium inhibits cyp2c9, and, to a lesser extent, cyp 2c8, cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5. 
 approximately 50-60% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine with the remainder eliminated in the 
 faeces. less than 1% of the dose is excreted as unchanged active ingredient. the terminal elimination 
 half-life (t
 ½) is 10 hours. steady state in volunteers is reached within about 6 days.no unexpected accumulation in the plasma was observed after multiple dosing at the recommended 
 dose of 100 mg once daily. however, at doses of 300 mg or higher, non-linear pharmacokinetics result 
 in disproportionately higher plasma concentrations of sitaxentan sodium. 
 special populations
 based on results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis and pooled pharmacokinetic data over 
 several studies, it was found that gender, race, and age do not clinically significantly affect the 
 pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan sodium.
 liver function impairment 
 the influence of liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan sodium has not been 
 evaluated. refer to section 4.3</p></section><section><header n="">. 5.3
 preclinical safety data</header><p>in repeated-dose toxicity studies, dose-related liver changes (weight, centrilobular hypertrophy, occasionally necrosis), induction of hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and slightly decreased 
 erythron parameters were seen in mice, rats and dogs. at high doses, dose-related increases in 
 prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) were also seen, most 
 prominently in rats, and coagulopathy (bleedings) in rats and dogs, but not mice. the significance of 
 these findings for humans is unknown.
 testicular tubular atrophy was observed in rats, but not in mice or dogs.</p><p>in the 26-week study, 
 moderate to marked diffuse seminiferous tubular atrophy was present at a very low incidence, whereas 
 in the 99-week study there was a dose-related, slightly increased incidence of minimal to mild focal 
 atrophy at doses providing 29 to 94 times the human exposure. 
 reproduction toxicity has been evaluated in rats only. thelin did not affect fertility in males and 
 females. thelin was teratogenic at the lowest tested dose in rats, corresponding to exposures more than 
 30 times the human exposure. dose-dependent malformations of the head, mouth, face and large blood 
 vessels occurred. a noael has not been established.
 administration of thelin to female rats from late-pregnancy through lactation reduced pup survival, 
 and caused testis tubular aplasia and delayed vaginal opening at the lowest exposure tested (17-45 
 times the human exposure). large / abnormally shaped livers, a delay in auditory function 
 development, a delay in preputial separation and a reduction in the number of embryonic implants 
 occurred at higher maternal doses.
 in vitro and in vivo tests on genetic toxicology did not provide any evidence for a clinically relevant genotoxic potential.
 thelin was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 97-99 weeks or when administered to
