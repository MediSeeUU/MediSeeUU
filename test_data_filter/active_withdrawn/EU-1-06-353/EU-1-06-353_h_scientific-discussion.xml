   1/37</header></section><section><header>scientific discussion  1. introduction</header><p>pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries that is characterised by vascular proliferation and remodelling. it results in a progressive increase in 
 pulmonary arterial resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular failure and death. a diagnosis for 
 primary (or idiopathic) pulmonary hypertension is made when no known risk factor is identified. the 
 functional classification of pah
 1 is as follows:</p><p> 
 • class i: pah without a resulting limitation of physical activity. ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope. 
 • class ii: pah resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. the patient is comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-
 syncope. 
 • class iii: pah resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. the patient is comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-
 syncope. 
 • class iv: pah resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. the patient has signs of right heart failure. dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at 
 rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</p><p>
 no current treatment cures this rare, devastating condition. however, during the past years treatment 
 options for patients with the disease have evolved to help prolong their survival and improve their 
 quality of life. at present, conventional treatment for patients with primary and secondary pah 
 includes calcium-channel blockers, anticoagulants, diuretics and oxygen. in addition, an oral 
 endothelin-1 receptor antagonist (bosentan), an intravenous prostacyclin (epoprostenol), an inhaled 
 prostacyclin (iloprost), a subcutaneous prostacyclin (treprostinil) and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor 
 (sildenafil) have also been licensed for the treatment of pah in various european countries. of these, 
 bosentan (tracleer
 ®), iloprost (ventavis®) and sildenafil (revatio®) have been authorised through the centralised procedure for orphan medicinal products, the latter of which received a positive chmp 
 opinion recently (july 2005). bosentan is indicated for patients with primary and scleroderma-
 associated pah, iloprost only for patients with primary pah, and sildenafil for patients with primary 
 and ctd-associated pah. all these three medicinal products are only licensed for patients with 
 nyha/who class iii disease severity. as a last resort, a lung or heart/lung transplant may be offered 
 to the patient.</p><p>
 the present application for marketing authorisation of thelin is made under article 8.3 (i) and 
 concerns a new active substance, sitaxentan sodium, for which a complete dossier has been submitted. 
 sitaxentan sodium is an endothelin receptor antagonist (etra), with higher selectively for the et
 a receptor than the etb receptor subtype.</p><p>the approved indication at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily is for the “treatment of 
 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as who functional class iii, to improve 
 exercise capacity. efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and in pulmonary 
 hypertension associated with connective tissue disease.”</p></section><section><header n="2">2. quality aspects  introduction</header><p>1 this classification was modified from the new york heart association classification of patients with cardiac disease. it is adapted from the executive summary of the world symposium on primary pulmonary hypertension in evian, france, in 1998. 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 2/37 
 thelin is presented as film-coated tablets containing 100 mg sitaxentan sodium inn per tablet. the tablets are packed in pvc-aclar/alu blisters or white hdpe bottles with white pp child resistant 
 closure.</p></section><section><header>drug substance (to be changed in the epar to “active substance”)</header><p>sitaxentan sodium is a yellow powder, which is non-hygroscopic. the aqueous solubility is ph dependent, being more soluble in alkaline solution. (0.4 mg/ml at ph 1, rising to 77.8 mg/ml at 
 ph 10). log p is in the region of 2.</p><p>
 • manufacture</p><p>
 a four-stage synthetic process has been well described and the critical parameters and accompanying 
 in process controls have been defined. specifications and control methods of the three main starting 
 materials are satisfactory. 
 evidence of the molecular structure of the active substance routinely produced by the defined method 
 of synthesis has been provided in the form of a number of techniques including sodium identity, icp-
 oes, roi, elemental combustion analysis, melting point, ir, uv, 
 1h and 13c nmr, and high resolution ms.</p><p>
 the organic impurities arising from the defined synthesis are known. the impurities have been 
 identified when found above 0.10%, and some below that level. no inorganic impurities are known to 
 be present, and residual solvents are present at levels complying with ich limits. all lots/batches of 
 sitaxentan sodium used for clinical drug supply have shown a consistent impurity profile, qualified 
 with reference to toxicology studies. in recent batches, no impurities are found above 0.15% by the 
 commercial manufacturing process, so qualification was not necessary (early batches used in toxicity 
 and carcinogenicity studies had levels above 0.15%). 
 there are 2 degradation products found, which have also been identified as metabolites.</p><p>
 • specification</p><p>
 the specification includes tests for assay (hplc), identification (hplc, ft-ir), total and specified 
 impurities (hplc), particle size (lased diffraction), residual solvents etc. the limits as set for the 
 individual impurities are in line with the ich requirements and in line with recent batch analysis 
 results. batch used during pre-clinical studies have similar impurity profiles but with slightly higher 
 levels, thus the potential toxicity of the impurities has been appropriately studied in view of the 
 proposed specification and the proposed dose. 
 analytical control methods have been validated with regard to relevant guidelines.</p><p>
 • stability</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 3/37 
 batches have been studied at 25ºc/60% rh, 30ºc/65% rh, 40ºc/75% rh, 5ºc., for up to 2 yrs (25ºc) by validated stability-indicating methods. 
 the active substance is photostable. standard stress studies have been performed, and the hplc 
 method has been shown to be stability indicating.</p><p>
 results support the proposed retest period.</p></section><section><header>medicinal product</header><p>• pharmaceutical development</p><p>
 the crystalline, stable, non-hygroscopic form of sitaxentan is used, which has a ph dependent aqueous 
 solubility, and the properties are well defined.</p><p>
 the particle size is controlled for uniform dissolution properties and more uniform bioavailability.</p><p>it 
 has been demonstrated that sitaxentan sodium tablets of two different particle size distributions give 
 comparable dissolution profiles, and all batches have satisfactory content uniformity.</p><p>
 excipients interactions with the active substance were studied. excipients that promoted degradation 
 of the active substance were excluded. also the coatings were tested, and shown to be compatible with 
 sitaxentan sodium. no novel excipients are used. all excipients comply with the pheur requirements 
 where necessary.</p><p>excipients of human or animal origin: the only material of human or animal origin is lactose, and is certified to meet eu requirements on tse. magnesium stearate and stearic acid are not of animal origin.</p><p>
 • manufacture of the product</p><p>
 sitaxentan sodium 100 mg coated tablets are made from a common granulation procedure. the 
 intragranular components are granulated in a fluid bed granulator, followed by milling, blending with 
 the extragranular components, and compression. the tablet cores are then film-coated for moisture 
 protection and taste masking.</p><p>
 • product specification</p><p>
 the product specification is standard for tablets, and contains tests with suitable limits for identity of 
 active substance, assay, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, total and specified degradation 
 products, water content, and</p><p>microbial bioburden . 
 batch analytical results (n=25) indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the agreed 
 specification.</p><p>
 • stability of the product</p><p>batches have been studied under the following conditions, 25ºc/60% rh, 30ºc/65% rh, 40ºc/75% 
 rh, photo stability, freeze thaw thermal cycle, according to ich guidelines. 
 validated, stability-indicating methods have been used and the results support the shelf life and 
 storage conditions as defined in the spc.</p></section><section><header>discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</header><p>satisfactory documentation has been provided to confirm the acceptable quality of this medicinal product, and no major objections have been raised during evaluation. the drug substance is adequately 
 characterized and the specification is acceptable in view of the route of synthesis and the various ich 
 guidelines. the solid drug substance is stable with respect to degradation. 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 4/37</p><p>concerning the finished product, it has been developed in a sound way and the manufacturing process is well studied and controlled. the in-process controls and release specification guarantee consistent 
 control of product quality. the drug product is shown to be stable and to maintain important quality 
 characteristics within the storage time and conditions as defined in the spc.</p><p>
 overall the product should perform well in a uniform manner in the clinic.</p><p>
 at the time of the chmp opinion, a number of minor quality issues related to stability (mass balance) 
 were unresolved. 
 the applicant agreed to solve these as follow up measures, within an agreed timeframe.</p></section><section><header n="3">3 non-clinical aspects 
  introduction</header><p>sitaxentan sodium is a highly selective endothelin a (eta) receptor antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as who 
 functional class iii, to improve exercise capacity.</p><p>
 endothelin-1 (et-1) is a potent vascular paracrine and autocrine peptide whose actions are mediated 
 through et
 a receptors present on smooth muscle cells and endothelin b (etb) receptors present on endothelial cells. predominant actions of et-1 binding to et
 a receptors are vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, while binding to et
 b receptors results in et-1 clearance and vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects due in part to nitric oxide and prostacyclin release. et-1 concentrations are 
 elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pah. et-1 and et
 a receptors play a key role in regulating vascular resistance in the lung by directly stimulating vasoconstriction and pulmonary 
 vascular remodeling and</p><p>
 this ultimately leads to progressive right heart failure.</p><p>
 the safety and potential local and systemic adverse effects of sitaxentan sodium were evaluated in 
 single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs. reproductive and developmental 
 toxicology studies in rats assessed potential adverse effects on libido, sexual activity, fertility, 
 pregnancy, embryo-fetal development, and post-natal development. the potential carcinogenic risk to</p><p>
 humans associated with chronic sitaxentan sodium treatment was evaluated using sprague-dawley 
 rats and p53+/mice, as well as the international committee of harmonization (ich)-recommended test 
 battery of genotoxicity studies, which included in vitro assessments of mutagenic activity in bacteria 
 and mammalian cells, clastogenic activity in mammalian cells, and a bone marrow micronucleus assay 
 in mice.</p><p>animals of all species were observed for clinical signs, laboratory findings and post-mortem 
 evidence of adverse events in toxicity studies.</p><p>
 all pivotal toxicity studies on safety pharmacology and toxicology were conducted in compliance with 
 good laboratory practices (glp) regulations. in addition, non-glp studies were also conducted. the 
 non-glp conditions of these studies were not considered to compromise the scientific integrity or 
 affect the experimental results.</p></section><section><header>pharmacology</header><p>• primary pharmacodynamics</p><p>
 sitaxentan sodium is a highly selective et
 a receptor antagonist that has been developed for treatment of pah. it binds to and blocks selectively (ratio et
 a/b is ~6,500 fold) and competitively eta receptors with high affinity (k
 i 0.43 nm), and potently inhibits receptor signalling (ki 0.43 nm; 0.686 nm). tested metabolites show much lower affinity. animal studies (using rats and pigs) have shown that 
 sitaxentan sodium (mg/kg range) is effective for pulmonary hypertension (pah) in response to 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 5/37 
 hypoxia; sitaxentan sodium was effective given (i.v. or oral) either before or after hypoxia. systemic haemodynamics were not affected.</p><p>
 • secondary pharmacodynamics</p><p>
 cardiac effects associated with chronic hypoxia-induced hypertension (increases in pulmonary arterial 
 pressure, pulmonary arterial wall, thickness in right heart hypertrophy) were attenuated by sitaxentan. 
 the ability of sitaxentan sodium to prevent changes in left ventricular function and cardiopulmonary 
 haemodynamics was shown in pigs with cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p>
 also, sitaxentan treatment blunted 
 the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance without significantly affecting systemic perfusion pressures 
 or heart rate. its preclinical efficacy was demonstrated in models of heart failure (50 mg/kg/day oral or 
 20 mg/kg iv: lowering resting mean blood pressure and heart rate) and myocardial infarction 
 (attenuation of rightward shift in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume 
 relationships relative to sham-operated controls, reduced contractile response to norepinephrine in 
 aortic rings as well as reduced systemic haemodynamics).</p><p> 
 • safety pharmacology programme</p><p>
 the potential for sitaxentan sodium to interact with biologically important targets and cause potential 
 adverse side effects was evaluated 
 in vitro and in vivo in multiple pharmacodynamic animal models of pah and congestive heart failure (chf) and cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system 
 (cns) safety pharmacology studies using rats, mice and dogs.</p><p>
 these studies suggest that sitaxentan sodium does not pose a risk of producing adverse effects on 
 respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, action potential prolongation or qt interval, or arrhythmia 
 activity. detailed studies on potential effects of sitaxentan on the renal, gastrointestinal and respiratory 
 system in different species showed no major side effects.</p><p>
 • pharmacodynamic drug interactions</p><p>
 no non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted on sitaxentan sodium, 
 this is acceptable as these studies are planned as post-authorisation commitments.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>many in vitro studies and in vivo toxicokinetic studies were performed. these data give a good picture of the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan at high doses in mice (100-400 mg/kg/day), rat (10-120 
 mg/kg/day) and dog (10-120 mg/kg/day). however, no kinetic information is available for lower 
 dosing of sitaxentan, i.e. for human application a dose of 100 mg/day (
 ≈ 1.4 mg/kg/day) is indicated.</p><p>intestinal absorption of sitaxentan was good, and sitaxentan was not a substrate for p-glycoprotein. 
 kinetics was generally less than dose-proportional in mice and rats, and dose-proportional or more 
 than dose-proportional in dogs. after dosing of sitaxentan the highest levels of radioactivity were 
 recovered in the liver, and to a lower extent in the kidney and lung. sitaxentan was highly bound to 
 plasma proteins, i.e. about 99.5% in humans at the c
 max level (10 µg/ml). sitaxentan and its metabolites are weak or potent inhibitors of cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and cyp3a4 activity, and possibly 
 of cyp2c8. sitaxentan may induce enzymes responsible for its own metabolism. sitaxentan is 
 eliminated via hepatic and renal clearance. 
 in vitro and in vivo studies on the interaction of sitaxentan with the hepatic transporter proteins 
 (hntcp (slc10a1), oatp1b1, oatp1b3, abc efflux-transporters) are planned and will be 
 provided as a follow up measures. 
 the safety regarding the metabolite in fraction p8 is not known. in the preclinical testing program, 
 animals (mouse, rats, dogs) have been exposed to the metabolite in fraction p8, but with a very low 
 safety margin. this means that if there is any toxicity associated with p8, there is a risk on an effect in 
 human at therapeutic exposure. to shed light on this point, the metabolite in fraction p8 should be 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 6/37 
 identified and it should be shown whether or not this metabolite is pharmacologically active. this information will be provided as a follow up measure.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>• single dose toxicity</p><p>
 the acute toxicity of sitaxentan was determined by the oral, i.v. routes of administration in mice and 
 rats. in mice, the highest non-lethal doses were in the 800 to 1200-mg/kg range by the oral and 200 to 
 300 mg/kg by the intravenous route. in rats, these values were in the range of 500 to 750 mg/kg and 
 125 to 375 mg/kg/day, respectively. at the maximum tolerated doses, tremors, subdued behaviour, 
 hunched appearance; laboured breathing and hypothermia were observed.</p><p>
 • repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)</p><p>
 repeated dose toxicity of sitaxentan was evaluated orally in mice, and both orally and intravenously in 
 rats and dogs. three oral toxicity studies of 14-days, 28-days and 26 weeks duration were conducted 
 in mice, four oral toxicity studies with durations of 7 days, 4 weeks, 13 weeks and 26 weeks in rats, 
 and six oral toxicity studies with durations of 3 days to 39 weeks were conducted in dogs. each study, 
 except the 7-day study in rats, the 3- and 9-day study in dogs included satellite groups in which 
 systemic exposure to sitaxentan was evaluated relationship, to dose level, sex, and duration of dosing. 
 in general, exposure increased with increasing dose level using once-a-day (qd) dose regimens. there 
 was little evidence of accumulation at doses below 300 mg/kg in mice and 80 mg/kg in dogs with qd 
 dosing. however, some accumulation was observed in rats at doses greater or equal to 120 mg/k/day 
 and mice at doses ≥ 400 mg/kg/day. in repeat dose oral studies using a two-times-a-day (bid) dosing 
 regimen, substantial accumulation was noted, especially in the trough plasma sitaxentan 
 concentrations of rats at doses of 30 mg/kg bid and above and in dogs at 50 mg/kg bid. this 
 continuous and relatively high exposure most likely accounted for the greater toxicity observed with 
 bid dosing. a bid dosing regimen was less well tolerated than qd administration. as assessed in the 
 39-week dogs study, the local and systemic effects of sitaxentan were reversible within 12 weeks after 
 dosing stopped.</p><p>
 in mice, rats and dogs, there were changes in a number of haematology parameters (e.g. decreases in 
 hb and hct, and increases in platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin times (aptt) and/or 
 prothrombin times (pt). in mice, the slightly longer aptt in males (at all dose levels) and in females 
 at ≥200 mg/kg/day were not associated with any signs of coagulopathy. increases in aptt were also 
 seen, but coagulopathy (bleedings) were not observed. in rats and dogs, blood-loss anaemia and 
 evidence of multi-organ haemorrhage was noted at higher dose levels in many repeat-dose studies 
 especially with bid dosing. in both rats and mice, there is an association of sitaxentan dose with 
 increased coagulation time parameters which results in safety margins relative to therapeutically 
 effective free plasma concentrations of &gt; 40. in mice rats and dogs, there is no correlation between 
 increases in pt, aptt and platelet count. the dose-dependent increase in pt and aptt observed in 
 vivo, most prominently in rats, indicates that sitaxentan can affect both the intrinsic (aptt) and 
 extrinsic (pt) pathways. in vitro, sitaxentan affected platelet aggregation in human and rat platelet-
 rich plasma at &gt; 300 and 1000 µg/ml, respectively. sitaxentan at up to 1000 µg/ml did not alter pt or 
 aptt. therefore, sitaxentan had minimal effects on coagulation parameters and platelet aggregation 
 in in vitro studies. 
 in rats and dogs, lower rbc count, hb concentration and hct and/or spleen weights were observed. 
 the noael for these effects was ≤20 mg/kg/day in the 13 week- and 30 mg/kg/day in the 26-week 
 rat study, and &lt;10 mg/kg/day in the 39-week dog study. 
 in mice, rats and dogs, there were changes in a number of clinical chemistry parameters (e.g. decrease 
 in total protein, albumin and/or decreases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) and greater heart 
 (most likely mild myocardial hypertrophy). urinalysis revealed increased urinary water excretion, 
 reflected in greater urine output and/or decreased urine concentrations of potassium and other 
 electrolytes. these observations were considered to be physiological response to plasma volume 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 7/37 
 expansion. the noael for these effects were &lt;200 mg/kg in mice (28-day study) and &lt;10 mg/kg/day in rats (26-week study) and dogs (39-week study).</p><p>
 in mice, rats and dogs, there were dose-related increases in the weights of liver (centrilobular 
 hypertrophy and occasionally also necrosis). at high doses, gall bladder hyperplasia and/or 
 inflammation were occasionally seen in mice at ≥ 400 mg/kg/day (28-day study) and in dogs at 80 
 mg/kg/day (39-week study). in the 99-week rat carcinogenicity study, liver hypertrophy was present at 
 an increased incidence in males at 15 mg/kg/day and in females in the 40 and 80 mg/kg/day dose 
 groups. in this study, centrilobular necrosis was present in both sexes at all dose levels. this finding 
 was dose-related and was considered the cause of death in animals at the higher dose levels (≥40 
 mg/kg/day). the noael for the liver effects were &lt;200 mg/kg in mice (28-day study) and &lt;10 
 mg/kg/day (26-week study) or &lt;15 mg/kg/day in rats (99-week study, see chapter on carcinogenicity) 
 and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs (39-week study). from these data, safety margins &lt;41.2 (based on the 13-
 week rat study) and &lt;27 (based on the 99-week rat study) and &lt;3.9 (based on the 39-week dog study) 
 can be calculated. this means that, with respect to early changes in liver weight the safety margin for 
 human is low. 
 in mice, rats and dogs, decreased serum cholesterol (mice, rat,), triglyceride (rat), bilirubin (rat), and 
 decreased or increased in alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine 
 aminotransferase. the noael for these effects were &lt;100 mg/kg in mice (28-day study) and &lt;10 
 mg/kg/bid in rats (26-week study) and &lt;10 mg/kg/day in dogs (39-week study).</p><p>
 • genotoxicity</p><p>
 the ames test was negative. the mouse lymphoma test was equivocal associated with cytotoxicity 
 and lacking dose dependence. the chromosome aberration test in cho cells was positive associated 
 with cytotoxicity. the in vivo mouse micronucleus test and the transgenic bioassay in p53± mice were 
 clearly negative. the conclusion that the effects seen in the in vitro studies in mammalian cells have to 
 be regarded as probably biologically irrelevant. this conclusion is further supported by the also 
 negative long-term carcinogenicity study in rats.</p><p>
 • carcinogenicity</p><p>
 the carcinogenic potential of sitaxentan was seen in a 99-week rat study and in a 26-week study in 
 p53+/- mice.</p><p>
 in the 99-week oral rat study, no toxicokinetic measurements were performed in control animals. 
 however, data do not indicate towards contamination of control samples.</p><p>most obvious effects 
 occurring already at low dose (exposure approximately 14-57x human exposure) were haemorrhages 
 in several organs and liver hypertrophy and centrilobular necrosis. the latter effect could possibly be 
 secondary to haemorrhages, but a primary effect of sitaxentan on the liver cannot be ruled out. red 
 blood cell decreases were probably caused by the haemorrhages. nasal cavity epithelial degeneration 
 and regeneration occurred, for which a gavage effect is a likely explanation. in males, also already at 
 the lowest dose, atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium in the testis was observed. these effects were 
 not considered relevant by the mah but nevertheless increased from the low dose were adrenal 
 cortical hyperplasia and degeneration of the lumbar spinal cord nerve fibre in males and cysts in ovary 
 and uterus in females. at the highest dose, body weight and food consumption were decreased and 
 accumulation of macrophages was observed in the lungs.</p><p>in male rats, an increased number of benign pheochromocytoma was observed in the adrenals. benign 
 pheochromocytoma is common in sprague dawley rats, however the difference in incidence with 
 controls was quite obvious. the highest incidence of benign pheochromocytomas in male sprague 
 dawley rats from the historical control data was 24 %, compared to 18, 21 and 22 % for the 15, 30 and 
 60 mg/kg sitaxentan treated dose groups. therefore, based on the historical control data, the incidence 
 of adrenal benign pheochtomocytomas in male sprague-dawley rats did not seem to be related to 
 sitaxentan. 
 tumour incidences that reached statistical significance in the rat carcinogenicity study were squamous 
 cell carcinomas in males, and basal cell adenomas and keratoacanthomas in male rats. the incidence 
 of squamous cell carcinomas in male rats (up to 5 %) was higher than that of the historical control data 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 8/37 
 (up to 1.8 %). the incidence of basal cell adenomas in male rats (up to 6.7 %) was higher than that of the historical control data (up to 2.7 %). the incidence of keratoacanthomas in male rats (up to 11.7 
 %) was below that of the historical control data (up to 13.4 %). the apparent increased skin tumour 
 incidence seems not to be associated with sitaxentan treatment based on the statistical analysis of 
 combined skin squamous cell tumours (papillomas, keratoacanthomas and carcinomas) and combined 
 skin basal cell tumours (adenomas) and absence of phototoxicity. it is not possible to combine all 
 types of skin tumours for statistical analysis in order to elucidate a possible relationship to treatment. 
 in the 26-week study in p53+/- mice, administration of sitaxentan sodium up to 200 mg/kg/day did not 
 result in increased mortality or clinical signs of toxicity. weight gain and food consumption were 
 inhibited in males from 50 mg/kg/day (exposure approximately 28-43 x human exposure) and in 
 females from 100 mg/kg/day. centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy in the liver was found in all 
 sitaxentan-treated groups and the incidence was dose-related. furthermore, in the liver, mononuclear 
 cellular infiltrate, cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes (males only) and individual cell necrosis 
 (females only, not dose-related) were observed in the liver. the liver effects were probably due to 
 adaptive response to metabolic events in the liver. degenerative changes of the olfactory epithelium, 
 often associated with the presence of exudates in the nasal cavity, were also observed in sitaxentan 
 sodium treated animals at all dose levels and were considered to be associated with reflux of the test 
 article from the nasopharynx up into the nasal cavity. furthermore, mononuclear cell infiltrate was 
 observed in the salivary glands of all sitaxentan-treated groups. the number of tumours was not 
 increased in sitaxentan-treated groups. in mice treaded with p-cresidine, the expected transitional cell 
 hyperplasia, metaplasia, papillomas, and/or carcinomas were observed, demonstrating the validity of 
 the model. the combined incidence of papillomas and carcinomas was 66.7% in males and 46.7% in 
 females.</p><p>
 • reproduction toxicity</p><p>
 fertility studies were conducted in rats with sitaxentan at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day (orally). no 
 effect on male fertility was observed. in the female fertility study, maternal no-effect level was 
 considered 20 mg/kg/day by the applicant because of a very slight effect on weight gain between gd 
 6-13 at dosages ≥ 80 mg/kg. however, this effect was hardly noticeable and therefore we consider the 
 maternal noel in this study to be 120 mg/kg. the incidence of foetuses with the minor abnormality 
 of protrusion of the median liver lobe with thinning diaphragm tended to be increased at ≥ 80 
 mg/kg/day. however, since the animals were dosed only up to gd6, this could not have been a 
 treatment-related effect. it can be concluded that this study showed no effect on female fertility. 
 the effect on embryo-foetal development has been investigated rats only. sitaxentan has demonstrated 
 to affect foetal development at all dose levels with a dose response relationship. considerable 
 teratogenicity was observed, in particular incomplete soft palates and large additional ossified areas in 
 the skull. at the lowest dose of 20 mg/kg bid, decreased pup survival, delayed female sexual maturity 
 and tubular atrophy/aplasia in the testis were observed. at higher dosages, of f1 animals, weight gain 
 during lactation was decreased, an increased liver was observed in males, male sexual maturity was 
 delayed, auditory function was delayed, and in f1 females a decreased number of implants was 
 observed.</p><p>at the lowest dose of 20 mg/kg/bid, the exposure to sitaxentan was about 30 times higher 
 than that in healthy and pah patients. since lower doses have not been tested, it is not clear whether 
 there is a safety margin for human. it also not clear whether the teratogenic effects observed represent 
 a class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists. thus far, bosentan is the only registered et receptor 
 antagonist. available preclinical information is insufficient to compare the reproduction toxicity 
 findings of sitaxentan with those of bosentan. there are no data on the use of sitaxentan in pregnant 
 women, but there is a need to treat hypertensive women of child bearing potential, also in situations 
 when other treatment alternatives are not suitable. following with these data the discussion scheme in 
 the discussion paper on contraindications in pregnancy, it is concluded that sitaxentan should not be 
 contraindicated in pregnancy.</p><p>
 • juvenile toxicity:</p><p>
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 9/37 
 sitaxentan sodium is not recommended for use in children under the age of 12 years. a study in juvenile animals is currently performed (results available in 2006), but no clinical studies in children 
 are ongoing at present. the mah will perform a paediatric clinical programme as a post-authorisation 
 commitment.</p><p>
 • local tolerance</p><p> 
 the local tolerance of orally and iv administered sitaxentan sodium was evaluated as part of the local 
 and systemic toxicity studies. with orally administered sitaxentan sodium, the only evidence of local 
 adverse effects was the occurrence of nasal discharge/epithelial degeneration (secondary to dosing 
 solution reflux) in mice and rats and vomiting in dogs at high doses in a few repeat-dose studies. since 
 no irritation of gi tract was seen, these findings are not considered to imply that orally administered 
 sitaxentan sodium would produce locally mediated adverse gi effects in humans. 
 for intravenous administration to mice, rats, and dogs, sitaxentan sodium was dissolved in a vehicle 
 composed of pvp:pg:water (5/10/85, w/v/v) or saline. in mice, sitaxentan sodium caused local 
 irritation at injection sites at ≥ 200 mg/kg with single iv doses. in rats, single or repeated daily iv 
 doses produced local irritation at dose levels ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, characterized by dark and swollen tails. 
 in dogs, repeated daily iv doses produced local irritation at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day, characterized by 
 injection-site inflammation and pain on injection. these findings suggest that sitaxentan sodium does 
 have the potential to cause local irritation at injection sites when administered parenterally.</p><p>
 • other toxicity studies</p><p>
 immunotoxicity 
 during the repeated-dose toxicity studies and the carcinogenicity study performed with sitaxentan, 
 there were no treatment-related effects on haematological parameters (except on red blood cells), 
 serum globulins and immune system organ weights or histopathology. the thymic atrophy observed in 
 mice and dogs was attributed to stress. no cause for concern regarding a possible immunotoxic effect 
 of sitaxentan was revealed.</p><p>
 phototoxicity 
 according to the</p><p>&quot;note for guidance on photosafety testing&quot;, photosafety testing is warranted for 
 those chemicals that absorb light in the wave length of 290-700 nm and are either topically applied or 
 reach the skin following systemic exposure</p><p>(cpmp/swp/398/01).</p><p>sitaxentan is a yellow powder, 
 which indicates that it absorbs light in the visible area. according to the mah, preliminary in vitro 
 findings using the 3t3 nru pt phototoxicity test utilizing the permanent mouse fibroblast cell line

 the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
 community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of directive 2001/20/ec.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>the pharmacokinetic program of sitaxentan sodium consisted of 23 studies, which included 522 patients with pah. additionally population pharmacokinetics analysis was conducted using data from 
 5 phase 1 studies (fnl01, fnl02, fnl06, fnl08a, and fnl13) and 2 phase 3 studies (fph01 and 
 fph02). 
 in vitro human biomaterial studies for sitaxentan evaluated its intestinal permeability, protein binding, hepatic metabolism and its potential for metabolism-based drug-drug interactions</p><p>
 • methods</p><p>
 sitaxentan concentrations in human plasma were determined by hplc coupled to a tandem mass 
 spectrometry detector ((lc/ms/ms). the method (low and high concentration range) was developed 
 by inveresk, scotland, and then adapted by analytical solutions inc, sunnyvale, usa. after 
 acquisition of analytical solutions by mds pharma services, the method was transferred and 
 revalidated at the mds laboratory in québec, canada. validation reports were submitted and the 
 assays were considered appropriate. the within-run and between-run accuracy and precision values 
 were generally within 10%. the detection of sitaxentan was in the range of 0.2 to 50 
 µg/ml and 50 to 12000 
 µg/ml for the inveresk method. the analytical range was 0.5 to 20000 µg/ml for the analytical solutions/mds method. sitaxentan is stable in plasma over a period of at least 692 days. freeze/thaw 
 cycles did not influence the accuracy or precision. even though no cross reference between the 
 methods performed by the different institutes was performed; the pharmacokinetic results between the 
 studies using the same dosages of sitaxentan are comparable</p><p>
 • absorption</p><p> 
 in vitro studies indicate that sitaxentan is not a substrate of p-gp. clinical interaction studies indicate 
 that sitaxentan might be a substrate of the oatbp1b1 transport protein.</p><p>
 the absolute bioavailability is between the 70 and 100 %. after administration of 25 and 100 mg 
 coated tablets the median t
 max ranges from 0.5 to 4 hours. the single-dose mean cmax values at the proposed therapeutic dose of 100 mg once daily were in the range of 7-13 
 µg/ml. at steady state, the mean 
 ± sd cmax, ctrough, and auc0-24 values were 13 ± 5 µg/ml, 0.06 ±0.07 µg/ml, and 40 ±26 µg.h/ml, respectively (fasting state). based on cmax data, steady state was reached after 5 days in healthy volunteers.</p><p>
 food affected the c
 max (43 % decrease with food) and tmax (2-fold increase with food) of sitaxentan (100 mg coated tablet) but not the auc. this food interaction has no clinical implication based on 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 11/37 
 efficacy data taken at through and close to the cmax.. therefore, it is agreed that sitaxentan can be administered with and without food.</p><p> 
 • distribution</p><p>
 sitaxentan binds extensively and dose-independently to human plasma proteins (99%), at clinical 
 relevant concentrations. sitaxentan does not penetrate into erythrocytes. in pre-clinical studies it was 
 shown that sitaxentan is excreted in breast milk. sitaxentan seems to cross the placenta and blood-
 brain-barrier.</p><p>
 • elimination</p><p>
 the terminal half-life after single dose and steady state administration of 100 mg sitaxentan was 
 approximately 7 hours. the terminal half-life did not differ substantially between the different dosages 
 or between oral or intravenous administration. however, at a dose of 1000 mg at steady state the 
 terminal half-life increased to 13 hours. sitaxentan is metabolised by cyp2c9 and 3a4/5. there 
 appears to be sufficient redundancy in the cyp metabolising pathways so that no single cyp is 
 considered rate limiting.</p><p>excretion in the urine and faeces accounted for 55% and 41% of the dose of 
 radioactivity, respectively, for an essentially complete recovery of ~96% after 96 hours. a total of 1 % 
 of the administered drug was excreted unchanged (in urine). the major metabolites of sitaxentan have 
 no clinical relevant activity.</p><p>
 no adme data were provided in relation to relevant polymorphisms of the drug metabolizing 
 enzymes (e.g. cyp2c9 and cyp2c19). according to the applicant sitaxentan sodium appears to be a 
 substrate for multiple efflux transporters in the canalicular membrane, including mxr and mrp2. the 
 applicant commits to conduct, and provided some preliminary data on preclinical in-vitro studies to 
 investigate the interaction of sitaxentan with several hepatic transport proteins (oatp, the human 
 hepatic abc efflux transporters mrp2 (abcc2), mxr (abcg2/bcrp), and bsep 
 (abcb11/spgp)). a statin interaction study using pravastatin is also planned to evaluate co-
 administration of statins and accumulation of sitaxentan.</p><p>
 • dose proportionality and time dependencies</p><p>
 in general pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers were roughly comparable with patients with pah. 
 a population pharmacokinetic study revealed that patients had an approximately 30% lower cl/f 
 compared to healthy subjects. consecutively, auc’s were significantly higher in patients. this may 
 be due to effect of pah on hepatic and renal blood flow. the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan are 
 nonlinear after oral administration to healthy volunteers and subjects with pah. the auc and the 
 c
 max increase more than dose-proportional after increasing oral doses of sitaxentan, while the terminal half life does not change significantly between the different administered doses. between the dose-
 interval of 50-100 mg the disproportional increase in exposure is less pronounced. the applicant 
 predicts an approximate 3-fold increase in aucs between 50 mg and 100 mg. according to the 
 applicant the nonlinear increase in auc could be due to a more immediate reduction in clearance by 
 inhibition of cyp3a4/5 during the first-pass through the liver. though less pronounced, dose 
 inproportionality is also found after intravenous administration of sitaxentan. a possible mechanism 
 for this is saturation of the multiple efflux transporters, and as such, the applicant has committed to 
 studying the mechanism of action through use of in vitro and animal models. no unexpected 
 accumulation in the plasma was observed after multiple dosing at the recommended dose of 100 mg 
 once daily. inter- and intra individual variability for the c
 max and auc ranged between the 10 and 35%.</p><p>
 • special populations</p><p>
 renal impairment has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan. no information was 
 provided regarding changed pattern of metabolites in urine with renal impairment. no 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 12/37 
 pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in patients with impaired hepatic function. as the effect of liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics is not clear, and non-linear pharmacokinetics may result in 
 disproportionately higher plasma concentrations of sitaxentan in patients with liver impairment, 
 sitaxentan should not be used in patients with impaired liver function (child-pugh class a-c). gender, 
 race, and age do not clinically significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan. increasing 
 weight resulted in an increase in apparent clearance. no pharmacokinetic studies with sitaxentan were 
 performed in children.</p><p>
 • pharmacokinetic interaction studies</p><p>
 in vitro, sitaxentan is a moderately potent inhibitor of cyp2c9 activity and a moderately weak 
 inhibitor of cyp2c8, cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5 activities. sitaxentan is a substrate for cyp3a4/5 and 
 cyp2c9.</p><p>
 the auc
 0-inf of s-warfarin (25 mg) increased with sitaxentan administration with 95%, for 100 mg once daily doses of sitaxentan (study fnl02). also the terminal half-life of warfarin increased after 
 sitaxentan co-administration. sitaxentan treatment did not influence the c
 max of s-warfarin. this effect is consistent with the in vitro finding of sitaxentan as cyp2c9 inhibitor. an enhanced effect on 
 prothrombin time and inr also was observed, consistent with the increase in exposure to s-warfarin. 
 warfarin is not licensed in all eu countries. these results obtained with warfarin can be extrapolated 
 to other anticoagulant drugs used in eu countries for similar indications, as is stated in the spc. mean 
 steady state plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (cyp3a4/5 substrate) were 
 higher with concomitant treatment of sitaxentan. the c
 max, and auc0-24 of ethinyl estradiol were increased by approximately 35 % and 60 %, respectively. the c
 max, and auc0-24 of norethindrone were increased by approximately 20 % and 45 %, respectively. measurements on follicle stimulating 
 hormone (fsh), luteinizing hormone (lh) indicated that there was no effect on anti-ovulatory 
 activity.</p><p>
 no clinical significant interactions on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine (cyp3a4/5 substrate), 
 sildenafil (cyp3a4/5 substrate), ciclosporin (cyp3a4/5 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein 
 substrate), omeprazole (cyp2c19 substrate), ketoconazole and nelfinavir (cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5 
 substrate) were found after concomitant treatment of sitaxentan. the dose of nifedipine used in study 
 fnl04 (3 doses daily of 10 mg) is the minimum advised dose, the maximum advised dose is 6 times 
 20 mg daily for the immediate release capsules of nifedipine, the maximum advised dose for sustained 
 release tablets of nifedipine is also 120 mg daily. therefore, in the spc it is remarked that an 
 interaction with nifedipine with higher doses cannot be excluded.</p><p> concomitant treatment with ciclosporin significantly increased sitaxentan pre-dose levels up to 
 approximately 6-fold. the combination of ciclosporin and sitaxentan is contraindicated in the spc. 
 the applicant postulates that this interaction may be caused by interaction at the oatb transporter 
 enzyme. the applicant will further investigate this in vitro. if necessary preclinical studies confirm 
 such an interaction in vivo studies will be performed. no clinical significant interactions on the 
 pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan were found after concomitant treatment of ketoconazole (inhibitor of 
 cyp3a4/5) and fluconazole (inhibitor of cyp2c19, cyp2c9, and cyp3a4/5). regarding the 
 possible impact of polymorphisms of the main metabolizing enzymes (e.g. cyp2c9) it is of relevance 
 that fluconazol (moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4/5, cyp2c9 and cyp2c19) did not significantly 
 change the pk of sitaxentan. albeit not investigated in subjects with known geno- or phenotype a 
 clinically relevant change in pk in poor metabolizers is therefore unlikely.</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics</header><p>to determine the effects of sitaxentan sodium on cardiovascular haemodynamics and function, studies were conducted in both healthy volunteers and subjects with pah, left ventricular dysfunction, 
 essential hypertension, and congestive heart failure.</p><p>
 non-selective blockade of the endothelin receptors has proven to be a useful treatment strategy in 
 primary and scleroderma-associated pah. it has been postulated that relatively selective antagonism 
 of the et
 a receptor may be further advantageous through blocking the deleterious vasoconstrictive medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 13/37 
 effects of endothelin-1 (et-1) on the pulmonary vasculature, while maintaining the vasodilator and clearance functions of the et
 b receptor. to date, the further clinical efficacy anticipated on the basis of this hypothesis remains to be proven. in study tbc11251-220 conducted in patients with 
 hypertension, numerically increased plasma levels of et-1 were observed after a 2-week oral dosing 
 of sitaxentan 160-480 mg bid, which was statistically significant in the highest dose group (480 mg 
 bid). this supports the endothelin receptor blocking action of sitaxentan with chronic oral 
 administration. it is of note that no pharmacodynamic (pd) studies were conducted in the target 
 population of pah patients, and that pd studies did not incorporate the 6-minute walk test as a 
 measure of clinical efficacy besides various haemodynamic parameters.</p><p>
 high-dose pd studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with left ventricular 
 dysfunction (lvd). in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant systemic haemodynamic effects were 
 observed at intravenous (iv) dosages up to 3.0 mg/kg. more relevant pd data came from two studies 
 conducted in patients with lvd. the first study (tbc11251-202, sitaxentan 0.3-10.0 mg/min or 
 placebo iv), showed a dose-dependent reduction in systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery 
 pressure (pap). meanwhile, changes in systemic systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and 
 cardiac index were generally minor and showed no clear dose-dependency. systemic diastolic blood 
 pressure showed a moderate dose-dependent reduction. in agreement with these findings, the second 
 study (tbc11251-03, sitaxentan 1.5-6.0 mg/kg or placebo iv) also showed sitaxentan’s efficacy in 
 lowering systolic pap in patients with lvd. the reduction in diastolic pap observed with sitaxentan 
 was however not significantly different from placebo. further, a statistically significant reduction in 
 pvr was observed with sitaxentan, indicating a pulmonary vasodilatory response. overall, these 
 effects, as demonstrated in patients with heart failure, may substantiate sitaxentan’s potential 
 therapeutic efficacy in patients with pah on the basis of a clinically useful effect on pap and pvr 
 without marked systemic haemodynamic consequences.</p><p>
 the potential clinically useful dose range was difficult to establish from the abovementioned pd 
 studies in the absence of data with multiple oral dosing in the target population of patients with pah. 
 instead, the dose selection for the first pivotal clinical study (fph-01) was mainly based on data from 
 phase ii clinical study tbc11251-211 in patients with pah receiving oral sitaxentan 100-500 mg bid 
 for 12 weeks (see section clinical efficacy/safety). besides showing favourable effects on relevant 
 pd and clinical efficacy parameters, safety concerns emerged in the extension phase of this study due 
 to clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and hepatitis in 2 subjects; one of these patients died 
 from liver failure (see below). in addition, michaelis-menten modelling was conducted using pk data 
 from normal human volunteers. sitaxentan 100 and 300 mg qd were predicted to yield steady-state 
 trough plasma free-drug concentrations of 1.4-fold and 6.1-fold in excess over the inhibition constant 
 (ic
 50) value, assuming 99.9% protein binding. therefore, sitaxentan 100 and 300 mg qd were chosen for study fph01 in an attempt to reduce risk while maintaining efficacy.</p><p>
 sitaxentan is an inhibitor of cyp2c9 and, to a lesser extent, of cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5. the 
 administration of warfarin (s-warfarin is a cyp2c9 substrate) resulted in a larger inr increase in 
 patients pretreated with sitaxentan versus placebo, consistent with sitaxentan’s potential to inhibit 
 cyp2c9 and the consequentially increased s-warfarin exposure (auc) during co-administration. the 
 mean values for the maximum pd effect and area under the pd effect curve were higher with 
 sitaxentan versus placebo. these findings underline the necessity of a dose reduction when sitaxentan 
 is initiated in patients treated with vitamin k antagonists that are cyp2c9-dependent in their 
 metabolism, to avoid an initially increased bleeding risk. this pd interaction has been taken into 
 account in the phase-3 clinical programme (see section clinical safety). no data on dose adaptation in 
 relation to polymorphisms of cyp2c9 have been provided. consistent with pk findings regarding an 
 increased nifedipine exposure during co-administration with sitaxentan (nifedipine is a cyp3a4/5 
 substrate), a somewhat increased bp lowering response was observed over time, but the lowest mean 
 sbp and dbp achieved were rather comparable in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd and placebo group, 
 indicating that a nifedipine dose reduction is not necessary. however, the nifedipine dosage selected 
 (10 mg tid) was below the usual maintenance dose, which has been reflected in the spc. regarding 
 the sildenafil interaction study (sildenafil is a cyp3a4/5 substrate), the mean maximum positive and 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 14/37 
 negative changes for both sbp and dbp were rather comparable for the sitaxentan and placebo treatments, indicating no dose-reduction to be necessary in case of co-administration. the anti-
 ovulatory effect of the oral anticonceptive ortho-novum 1/35
 ® was maintained during co-administration. sitaxentan led to an additional an increase (approximately 2-fold) in plasma 
 concentrations of progesterone in this study. the altered ratio of the oestrogen and the gestagen 
 component may have an impact on the risk/benefit ratio of the oral contraceptive, especially in 
 smoking women, who would have an increased risk for thromboembolism due to the relatively higher 
 (59% increase of ethinyl estradiol versus 47% increase of norethindrone) oestrogen component. this 
 has been reflected in the spc.</p></section><section><header>clinical efficacy</header><p>• dose response studies</p><p>
 dose finding was based on small initial studies and on investigation of three different doses in the 
 large trials fph01, 02, and 04.</p><p>
 tbc11251-211 was the initial sitaxentan uncontrolled study to explore efficacy and safety in pah as 
 a proof of concept study. the study was conducted at doses higher than those used in the subsequent 
 pivotal studies (4-6 mg/kg dosed bid, for total doses of 100-500 mg bid). the study indicated an 
 increase in 6-minutes walk test and of haemodynamic parameters that did not correlate well, however. 
 in the small population of 14 patients, an unfavorable safety profile was shown. two patients 
 developed acute hepatitis after a total of 4 - 5 months on study drug. one of the patients discontinued 
 the study due to the adverse event (hepatitis), the other one died from liver failure despite reduction 
 and discontinuation of study drug.</p><p>
 finally, dose finding was established by including 50, 100, and 300 mg qd arms in the large and 
 pivotal clinical trials. as the 50 mg qd dose did not proof to be efficacious and the 300 mg qd dose 
 had an unfavourable safety profile, the pivotal trials revealed 100 mg qd as the therapeutic dose. 
 there does not seem to be a close correlation between plasma sitaxentan levels and clinical efficacy as 
 measured by the 6-minutes walk test. for example, pk data from study fph-01 suggest that plasma 
 levels are very low after 6h or less with 100 mg qd. there is one pk study comparing 1x200 mg bid 
 vs 2x200 mg qd. it was concluded from that study that if pharmacodynamic outcome is related to 
 cmax, then the qd regimen may be more appropriate. if, on the other hand, pharmacodynamic 
 outcome is related to overall drug exposure (e.g. auc), the bid regimen may be more appropriate, 
 because it allows for less fluctuating plasma concentrations, higher cminss concentrations, and lower 
 cmaxss concentrations, thus reducing the risk of toxicity while maintaining the necessary plasma 
 concentrations for a pharmacological effect. these mainly theoretical concerns were based on pk 
 data, but were not substantiated by clinical endpoint studies. in study fph01, the 6-minutes walk test 
 was performed at trough (24h post dosing) at very low plasma levels. patients with 300 mg had about 
 48 fold trough plasma-levels compared to those on 100 mg, but efficacy was not different. in study 
 fph02, the 6-minutes walk test was taken at different time points. furthermore, it took several weeks 
 to achieve a significant therapeutic effect. overall, these data indicated that the long-term effects on 
 the 6 minutes walk test were not dependent on continuous high plasma levels and can be achieved 
 with a once daily dosing regimen.</p><p>

 2), which is an endpoint of uncertain clinical relevance. the study report did not mention a closed hierarchical stepwise testing procedure, thereby limiting any potential 
 claims on the basis of secondary endpoints, which included the 6-minute walk test as well in fph01. 
 the primary efficacy endpoint in fph02 and fph04 was the change from baseline to week 18 in the 
 6-minute walk test distance. thus, these pivotal studies were not designed to evaluate long-term 
 effects of sitaxentan or to demonstrate improved survival.</p><p>
 the inclusion and exclusion criteria only permitted patients with primary, ctd-associated, or chd-
 associated pah to be enrolled. consistent with the accepted definition of pah, a precapillary 
 pulmonary hypertension (mean pap &gt;25 mmhg at rest) with a pcwp &lt;15 mmhg was required. it is 
 of note that patients with pre-existent hepatic disease were excluded from these studies. no 
 requirement for a 6-minute walk test distance at baseline was postulated for fph01, but a baseline 
 distance between 150-450 meters was required for fph02 and fph04. complementary to the upper 
 limit postulated for the baseline walking distance, patients with who functional class i were 
 excluded. patients receiving non-conventional pah treatments (e.g. bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil) 
 were excluded. 
 across the pooled itt population for these studies, a large majority of patients had primary pah 
 (299/521; 58%) or ctd-associated pah (129/512; 25%). most patients were assessed as having 
 who functional class ii (210/512; 41%) or class iii (291/512; 57%), while very few patients were in 
 class iv (11/512; 2%). by exclusion, zero patients were in class i disease severity. study fph01 and 
 fph02 recruited predominantly class iii patients, while in fph04 a majority had a lesser disease 
 severity (class ii). as expected, there was a female-to-male preponderance with 80% being female. 
 studies fph01 and fph02 included mostly caucasians, while in study fph04 the majority of patients 
 were non-caucasians (mainly hispanics or latinos). overall, baseline characteristics regarding age, 
 gender, race, pah aetiology, concomitant medications, and who classification were reasonably 
 comparable across treatment groups within each study.

 sample size in fph01, a sample size of approximately 180 subjects (60 subjects/treatment group) was estimated to provide approximately 80% power to detect a 4% absolute difference at week 12 in percent of 
 predicted peak vo
 2, as measured during cycle ergometry in at least 1 of the sitaxentan groups compared with placebo. assuming that (a) the baseline value for sitaxentan-treated subjects for peak 
 vo
 2 is 37.2%, and (b) no improvement is observed in placebo subjects through week 12, a 4% absolute difference in peak vo
 2 was necessary to obtain approximately 10% relative improvement, which is considered clinically meaningful. this sample size was calculated based on a type i error of 
 0.01, equal variance for placebo-treated and sitaxentan-treated groups (sd of 5.4%), 2-sided test, and 
 adjusted for multiple comparisons using the dunnett test.</p><p>
 based on results from fph01, fph02 had a sample size of approximately 60 subjects per treatment 
 group to detect statistically significant differences between the treatment groups, with 90% overall 
 power at the significance level of 0.05 using a 2-sided student t test. this study was powered to 
 identify statistical differences in efficacy between the 100 mg sitaxentan and placebo groups. a total 
 of 240 subjects were required to be randomized and treated. 
 also based on results from fph01, fph04 had a sample size of approximately 30 subjects per 
 treatment group to detect statistically significant difference between treatment group sitaxentan 
 100 mg and placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint. this estimation was based on a 2-sided student 
 t-test with type i error of 0.05 and statistical power of 85%.</p><p>
 randomisation</p><p>in fph01, randomization was done assigning the subject the next available blinded drug kit. the blinded drug kit was numbered sequentially according to the randomization schedule, which was 
 stratified by sites and blocked to ensure balance between treatment groups.</p><p>
 in fph02 and fph04 an interactive voice response system (ivrs) was used, assigning a drug kit 
 number, blinding the site personnel and the subject to the actual treatment assignment. the bosentan 
 treatment arm in fph02 was unblinded both for subject and investigator.</p><p>
 blinding (masking) the studies were adequately blinded. site personnel conducting efficacy assessments were to be conducted by trained personnel who were blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment, including 
 coagulation test results and bosentan where applicable.

 endpoint, and incorporated a bosentan active-control arm as well. the improvement in 6-minute walk 
 test distance showed some dose dependency in this study, and a statistically significant moderate 
 improvement from baseline in 6-minute walk test distance was noted with sitaxentan 100 mg qd of 
 24.9 meters versus -6.5 meters with placebo (difference vs. placebo: 31.4 m). importantly, the 
 bosentan group that was included for descriptive purpose (i.e., without the power to test a hypothesis 
 of non-inferiority), showed a comparable improvement of 23.0 meters after 18 weeks of treatment 
 (difference vs. placebo: 29.5 m).</p><p>

 the results were generally confirmed in study</p></section><section><header>fph01</header><p> also conducted in a predominantly caucasian who functional class iii primary and ctd-associated pah population, showing a comparable 
 placebo-corrected improvement with sitaxentan 100 mg qd at 12 weeks (35.1 m). the efficacy of 
 sitaxentan 300 mg qd did not improve compared to 100 mg qd in fph01. sitaxentan 50 mg qd, that 
 produced statistically insignificant improvements versus placebo at all time points in fph02, was less 
 efficacious. the results on the change from baseline to week 12 in percent of predicted peak oxygen 
 uptake were not consistent with the relative improvements in 6-minute walk test distance on 
 sitaxentan, underlining the questionable validity of this alternative primary endpoint in fph01 
 reflecting maximal aerobic capacity. 
 the third pivotal study,</p></section><section><header>fph04</header><p>, was conducted in a different population of non-caucasian patients with a lesser disease severity and half as much patients per treatment group (n=32). large, positive 
 placebo and sitaxentan 100 mg qd treatment effects were noted (33.8 and 58.0 m, resp) compared to 
 the other studies. this may seem remarkable, given the lesser disease severity in fph04 (i.e., who 
 class ii instead of class iii patients), in which a smaller treatment effect might be expected a-priori in 
 pah patients. these findings may however relate to sample size and the fact that randomised clinical 
 studies are generally appropriate for comparing treatment effects across randomised treatment groups, 
 while being less suitable for determining the true treatment effect within a given treatment arm. in this 
 respect, it is noted that a smaller relative improvement versus placebo was noted with sitaxentan 100 
 mg qd in fph04 (24.2 m) compared to fph01 and fph02, consistent with the abovementioned 
 assumption of disease severity-related efficacy. further, study fph01 and fph02 conducted in 
 patients with similar disease severity (class iii) showed a good consistency in their relative 
 improvements on sitaxentan 100 mg qd vs. placebo (31.4 and 35.1 m, resp).</p><p>
 in order to allow for an assessment of a potential influence of differences in the concomitant 
 medications between treatment groups, the applicant presented an overview of classes of medications 
 used by treatment group for pivotal studies fph01, fph02 and fph04, with emphasis on pah-related 
 and vasodilatory medicinal products. the percentage usages of drugs approved for the treatment of 
 pah and other vasodilatory medicinal products across the 3 treatment groups in the placebo-
 controlled trials were not considered sufficiently different in each case to account for differences in 
 efficacy responses between placebo and active drugs (sitaxentan sodium and bosentan). overall, the 
 relative improvement in exercise capacity (6-minute walk test distance) with sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 versus placebo (~33 m) appears to be clinically relevant, in view of a numerically comparable relative 
 improvement observed with the previously licensed medicinal product bosentan (30 m). as expected 
 in a rare disease, non-inferiority has not been formally demonstrated. the placebo-corrected 
 improvement in the subgroup of patients dominated by who class iii patients was 46 m. 
 the results on the predicted peak oxygen uptake (primary endpoint fph01) showed statistically 
 insignificant absolute decrease in mean percent of predicted peak vo
 2 (i.e., peak exercise oxygen consumption; maximal aerobic capacity) of 0.4% with sitaxentan 100 mg qd compared with a mean 
 decrease of 0.1% in the placebo group. in contrast, sitaxentan 300 mg qd showed a statistically 
 significant absolute increase in mean percent of predicted peak vo
 2 of 3.0-4.1%. these results on cardiopulmonary exercise testing are not consistent with the relative improvements with sitaxentan 
 100 and 300 mg qd regarding the established clinically relevant endpoint of 6-minute walk test 
 distance, which may be due to the fact that both tests measure different abilities. cardiopulmonary 
 exercise testing is symptom-limited and measures maximal exercise performance, while the 6-minute 
 walk test is time-limited and measures exercise capacity performed at the patient’s own pace. in any 
 case, the disparity in outcomes underlines the questionable validity of this alternative primary 
 endpoint in fph01.</p><p>
 results on secondary endpoints</p><p>in the absence of a pre-specified statistical procedure accounting for multiplicity, the secondary endpoint results for change from baseline in who/nyca functional class, clinical worsening and 
 borg dyspnea score are considered supportive, and thus not compelling enough to substantiate any 
 specific claims. sitaxentan 100 mg qd treatment was generally associated with better who 
 classification outcome versus placebo at the end of the studies. this was confirmed by the results 
 regarding the incidence of clinical worsening, showing a lower incidence with sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 22/37 
 versus placebo in all three studies. sitaxentan 100 mg qd however failed to produce statistically significantly lower borg dyspnoea scores compared to placebo at the end of the study in fph02 and 
 fph04, which also applied for bosentan in fph02.</p><p>
 ancillary analyses compared to placebo, both sitaxentan 100 and 300 mg qd resulted in statistically significant reductions in pvr and svr, while a significant increase in cardiac index was noted. for the majority 
 of haemodynamic measurements, only the changes observed with sitaxentan 300 mg qd achieved 
 statistical significance versus placebo (in particular mpap and mrap), although a favourable trend

 2 at the at, or cycle ergometry exercise time. this latter statistically insignificant result on cycle ergometry time versus a statistically significant improvement on the 6-minute walk test 
 distance required further discussion. although in a different setting (symptom limited maximal 
 exercise performance vs. time limited exercise capacity at the patient’s own pace), both tests intend to 
 measure exercise capacity. this issue was studied and the conclusion was that the exact reason for 
 failure of the cycle ergometry in fph01 still remained unclear. however, it was agreed that the 6 
 minutes walk test measuring exercise capacity at the patient’s own pace represents the best-validated 
 endpoint in pah, which was appropriately performed at trough. the change from baseline to week 12 
 in heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation and systemic arterial oxygen saturation did not differ 
 significantly for either sitaxentan dose group compared to placebo.</p><p>
 overall, sitaxentan 100 mg qd may be considered as having a moderately favourable effect on 
 pulmonary vascular haemodynamics in patients with pah on the basis of its pap and pvr lowering 
 potency, without affecting oxygenation status. these findings are in line with previous findings in 
 pharmacodynamic studies in patients with lv dysfunction (see section on clinical pharmacology).</p><p>
 • supportive studies</p><p>
 supportive efficacy: studies fph01-x, fph02-x and fph03 
 these long-term studies were primarily safety studies. efficacy results on these studies should be 
 cautiously interpreted due to the lack of a placebo or active control arm (except for fph02-x that 
 included a bosentan treatment arm) and their open-label nature (except for fph01-x that was blinded 
 to treatment).</p><p>
 the large open-label study</p></section><section><header>fph03</header><p> (sitaxentan 100 mg qd) that produced interim data on a substantial amount of patients up to week 28 (n=229), suggested moderate improvements in exercise capacity

 up to this time point. these results are in line with previous findings from the pivotal trials up to 18

 that placebo- and sitaxentan 50 mg qd-treated patients were switched to either sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 or bosentan in the extension phase.</p><p>

 which is acceptable. overall, within the limitations posed by the absence of a placebo or active control 
 arm and the open-label nature, these studies suggested maintenance of sitaxentan’s efficacy up to 28 
 weeks of treatment.</p><p>

 in patients who have failed on bosentan (a drug with a similar mechanism of action) has a questionable clinical rationale. the interpretation of the results of this small-sized study was not straightforward in 
 the absence of a placebo or active control arm, although ethical (placebo) and practical (unavailability 
 of commercial bosentan to allow blinding) difficulties were acknowledged. the subset of patients who 
 entered the study on the basis of safety reasons (n=13) was too small to allow for any meaningful 
 conclusion in this context. in the ‘lack-of-efficacy’ subset (n=35), 7 (20%) and 6 (17%) sitaxentan-
 treated patients respectively showed an in- and decreased 6-minute walk test distance of at least 15% 
 at week 12. in this same subset, 2 (6%) and 6 (17%) respectively showed an improvement and 
 progression (i.e., deterioration) in who functional classification. in the context of the aforementioned 
 methodological limitations, these results were not considered compelling enough to support any 
 specific recommendation in patients experiencing a lack of efficacy on bosentan.</p></section><section><header>clinical safety</header><p>sample size allowed only common aes to be analysed in subgroups; no subgroup data on sae and discontinuations were provided.</p><p>
 • patient exposure</p><p>
 across all phase 2 and 3 studies in patients with pah, 899 patients have been treated with sitaxentan 
 with a mean exposure of 29 weeks, while 155 and 83 patients have been exposed to placebo or 
 bosentan for mean duration of 15 and 27 weeks, resp. of the 526 sitaxentan patients exposed for at 
 least 6 months, 378 (72%) have been treated ≤ 12 months, 136 (26%) have been treated for at least 1 
 year but &lt; 1.5 years, but very few patients received sitaxentan past 1.5 years (12 patients). of the 48 
 patients in the bosentan group exposed for at least 6 months, 41 (85%) have been treated ≤ 12 months, 
 while only 7 patients (15%) have been treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>
 • adverse events</p><p> 
 in the medium-term phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in patients with pah, at least 1 treatment 
 emergent ae was experienced by comparably high proportions among treatment groups (all sitaxentan 
 91%, sitaxentan 100 mg qd 92%, placebo 92%, bosentan 89%). aes that occurred in more than 10% 
 of sitaxentan 100 mg qd patients included headache (28%), oedema peripheral (21%), nausea (15%), 
 upper respiratory tract infection (15%), dizziness (13%), nasopharyngitis (13%), nasal congestion 
 (13%) and insomnia (13%). the incidences of specific aes were comparable between sitaxentan and 
 placebo treated patients, except for marked higher incidences (difference ≥ 5%) on peripheral oedema 
 (21% vs. 16%), insomnia (13% vs. 6%), nasopharyngitis (13% vs. 7%), nasal congestion (13% vs. 
 6%), upper respiratory tract infection (15% vs. 8%) and epistaxis (8% vs. 3%) with sitaxentan 100 mg 
 qd versus placebo. however, when the preferred terms of oedema and peripheral oedema were 
 combined, the overall incidence was comparable between the sitaxentan 100 mg qd (22%), placebo 
 (21%) and bosentan (25%) group. when nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus congestion, sinusitis, 
 upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngolaryngeal pain were combined, the overall incidences 
 were higher in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd and bosentan groups (45% and 48%, resp) compared to the 
 placebo group (32%). marked incidence differences (difference ≥ 5%) in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 versus bosentan group concerned vomiting (5% vs. 0%, resp), muscle cramp (7% vs. 0%), headache 
 (28% vs. 20%), insomnia (13% vs. 0%), cough (5% vs. 13%), dyspnoea (7% vs. 15%) and pulmonary 
 hypertension (1% vs. 7%). the increased incidence of epistaxis with sitaxentan may be related to a 
 higher incidence on inr increased (sitaxentan 100 mg qd 6%, placebo 4%, bosentan 3%), for which 
 a sitaxentan dose-dependency was demonstrated (50-300mg; 4%-14%).</p><p>
 regarding common aes judged to be drug-related, sitaxentan treatment was associated with higher 
 rates on coagulation/bleeding-associated (inr increased, pt prolonged, epistaxis) and vasodilation-
 associated (peripheral oedema, flushing) aes compared to placebo. the presence of a dose-
 dependency further supports the association with study drug for these aes. overall, sitaxentan and 
 bosentan were generally associated with higher rates on upper respiratory tract disorders and 
 vasodilation-associated events (mainly peripheral oedema) compared to placebo, while sitaxentan 
 further elicited an increased rate on bleeding events (mainly epistaxis). 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 24/37 
 adverse events were also analysed by subgroup. females treated with sitaxentan 100 mg qd experienced peripheral oedema more frequently compared to males, while no such difference was 
 observed in placebo-treated female and male patients. however, no consistent difference was noted in 
 ae frequencies between female and male sitaxentan-treated patients. sitaxentan’s safety profile 
 appeared to be more favourable in caucasians on the basis of lower frequencies for most aes in 
 caucasian versus non-caucasian patients (i.e., latinos and hispanics). within the limitations posed by 
 the low number of elderly patients (≥65 years) treated with either sitaxentan or placebo (n=27 and 24, 
 resp), no consistent difference was noted in ae frequencies between patient’s aged 18-65 and the 
 elderly. sitaxentan’s ae profile appeared to be comparable in patients with primary and ctd-
 associated pah, as well as in patients in who functional class ii versus iii.</p><p>• serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</p><p>
 in the phase 2 and 3 oral studies conducted in patients with pah, at least 1 sae was experienced by 
 comparable proportions of patients across treatment groups; sitaxentan 23%, placebo 20%, bosentan 
 25%. a lower proportion of pah patients experienced serious cardiac disorders (predominantly right 
 ventricular failure, chest pain and cardiac failure) in the all doses sitaxentan compared to the placebo 
 group (5.3% vs. 7.1%, resp), but this rate was lowest in the bosentan group (3.6%). on the other hand, 
 serious respiratory disorders (predominantly pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia and dyspnoea) were 
 less frequently observed in the all doses sitaxentan group compared bosentan (9.1% vs. 14.5%, resp), 
 while this proportion was lowest in the placebo group (3.2%). an increased inr was more frequently 
 reported as sae with sitaxentan compared to all other groups, but the overall absolute incidence was 
 low in the sitaxentan 50-100 mg qd group (0.4%). notably, the incidence of anaemia reported as sae 
 was lower with sitaxentan and bosentan compared to placebo (≤ 0.4% vs 1.3%, resp). when 
 combining the saes hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, alt increased and ast 
 increased, the incidences with sitaxentan 50-100 mg qd and bosentan were comparable (1.0% and 
 1.2%, resp) and higher than placebo (0.6%). overall, the sae profile of sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 appears to be comparable to bosentan, although the small number of patients in this latter treatment 
 group (n=83) precludes drawing robust conclusions, in particular regarding relatively infrequently 
 occurring saes such as hepatitis (see below). 
 the incidence of death in the medium-term pivotal studies fph01, fph02 and fph04 was lower with 
 sitaxentan compared to placebo (1/306=0.3% sitaxentan; 2/155=1.3% placebo), while no deaths 
 occurred in the smaller group of patients treated with bosentan (n=61). as expected, most deaths were 
 due to cardiopulmonary causes. in general, the poor prognosis of the disease, the limited amount of 
 patients treated and the lack of a control group make it difficult to draw conclusions about the 
 causality of deaths in the long-term extension studies. the only long-term study incorporating a 
 control arm for descriptive purpose was fph02-x, in which 5/125=4.0% sitaxentan-treated and 
 3/65=4.6% bosentan-treated patients died from various causes, thereby posing no safety concerns. one 
 death of particular interest was observed in the preceding phase 2 clinical study tbc11251-211-x 
 (extension phase), in which a patient initially dosed with sitaxentan 300 mg bid died from hepatic 
 failure, indicative of drug-related hepatotoxicity. this death urged the applicant to reduce the target 
 dosage ≤ 300 mg qd in the pivotal phase 3 studies. notably, no clinical significant interactions on the 
 pharmacokinetics of sitaxentan were found after concomitant administration of cyp3a4/5 or 
 cyp2c9 inhibitors (see pk section). overall, the incidence of death experienced at the spc 
 recommended dose level does not raise major safety concerns, but any claim towards the prevention of 
 mortality relative to current standards of medical care remains unjustified in the absence of clinical 
 outcome studies.</p><p>
 • laboratory findings</p><p>
 hepatic toxicity 
 the rates on treatment emergent elevations in alt values &gt; 5 × uln in phase 2 and 3 oral studies in 
 pah patients were 0.7% for placebo, 4% for sitaxentan 100 mg qd, and 6% for bosentan. a 
 comparable pattern was observed when analysing a lower aminotransferase threshold, since the rates 
 of elevations in alt and/or ast values &gt; 3 × uln were 5% for placebo, 7% for sitaxentan 100 mg 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 25/37 
 qd, and 12% for bosentan. in a head-to-head comparison in the randomised active-controlled studies fph02 and fph02-x, the kaplan-meier risk of elevation in alt and/or ast values &gt; 3 × uln 
 within the first year of exposure was less for sitaxentan sodium 100 mg qd (4%) than bosentan 
 (14%). the majority (90%) of elevations in aminotransferases occur by 9 months and typically 
 returned to normal or baseline by 4 months in both usual- and special risk patients. the assessment of 
 safety data regarding hard clinical endpoints such as hepatic failure is restricted by the infrequent 
 nature of these events, the limited amount of pah patients treated, and the frequent presence of 
 confounding risk factors in these seriously ill patients. a detailed analysis of patients with alt &gt; 5 × 
 uln yielded a total of 7 patients on sitaxentan 100 mg qd that met hy’s rule
 2 and/or had clinically symptomatic hepatitis. two of these 7 patients were reported to have clinically symptomatic hepatitis, 
 of which one proceeded to liver failure. overall, the data suggest that the hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan 
 is at a comparable level versus bosentan, although firm conclusions should not be drawn on the basis 
 of these limited data obtained so far. the spc contains contra-indications, warnings, and strict 
 monitoring plus stopping rules related to hepatic function. also, sitaxentan will be distributed using a 
 controlled access system and hepatotoxicity will be monitored in a post-marketing surveillance 
 system. the underlying mechanism of hepatotoxicity remains unclear at present</p><p> 
 haemoglobin reductions 
 in the current placebo-controlled studies in patients with pah, the mean change in haemoglobin, 
 hematocrit, rbcs, and wbcs showed a consistent pattern of decreased values at the end of treatment, 
 which was also observed with bosentan. a sitaxentan dose-dependency was noted. the magnitude of 
 the decreases in these parameters was generally comparable in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd and 
 bosentan treatment group (e.g. reduction in haemoglobin; 0.5 vs. 0.7 g/dl, resp). the proportion of 
 patients with decrease in haemoglobin ≥ 1.0 g/dl was substantially larger in the sitaxentan 100 mg 
 qd and bosentan treatment group compared to placebo (~60% vs. 32%, resp), while the proportion of 
 patients with ≥ 15% decrease from baseline resulting in a value less than the lower limit of normal was 
 larger with sitaxentan 100 mg qd compared to placebo and bosentan (7% vs. 3%, resp). a 
 comparable pattern was observed for hematocrit. the proportionally small mean changes in platelets 
 observed with sitaxentan and bosentan were of minor clinical relevance. in patients exposed for at 
 least 6 months, the proportion of patients who experienced at least a 1.0 g/dl decrease from baseline 
 in haemoglobin was comparable in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd and bosentan group (68% vs. 66%, 
 resp). also, the proportion of patients with ≥ 15% decrease from baseline in haemoglobin resulting in 
 a value less than the lower limit of normal was comparable in the sitaxentan 100 mg qd and bosentan 
 group (8% vs. 9%, resp). again, a similar pattern was observed regarding hematocrit. the mean 
 reduction in haemoglobin and hematocrit tended to decrease in the course of 12 months.</p><p>
 overall, complementary to previous data obtained with bosentan, these data indicate that haemoglobin 
 (and hematocrit) reductions are a dose-dependent class effect of etras. the cause for this change 
 remains unclear, although underlying mechanisms related to hemodilution, a slow production effect 
 and slow blood loss have been postulated. of note, anaemia as sae was infrequently reported on 
 sitaxentan and bosentan, with a lower rate versus placebo (≤ 0.4% vs. 1.3%, resp). 
 the spc on sitaxentan sodium recommends haemoglobin to be measured before initiating treatment 
 and periodically thereafter.</p><p>
 bleeding events 
 in patients using warfarin or warfarin analogues, the incidence of bleeding was higher in the all doses 
 and 100 mg qd sitaxentan groups compared to the placebo group (39/225=17% and 15/110=14% vs. 
 12/117=10%, resp). this bleeding pattern is likely mainly driven by the interaction between sitaxentan 
 and warfarin (increasing the inr), that was not accounted for during the initial part of the clinical 
 phase 3 programme. the lower bleeding rate with bosentan versus placebo (2/41=4.9% vs. 10%, resp) 
 may be secondary to induction of warfarin metabolism by bosentan. remarkably, no dose-dependency 
 was noted across sitaxentan 50-300 mg/day. approximately half way through study fph01, a protocol 
 amendment was made to reduce the warfarin dose at sitaxentan initiation. very few cases of bleeding</p><p>

 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 26/37 
 events associated with inr &gt; 3.5 occurred after this amendment in fph01; zero on placebo, 1 on sitaxentan 100 mg qd (ecchymosis/inr 4.9), and 1 on sitaxentan 300 mg qd (haemoptysis/inr 6). 
 after the protocol amendment, the incidence of inr &gt; 3.5 with sitaxentan 100 mg qd were rather 
 comparable to placebo (3.1% vs 2.1%, resp). the interpretation of these data is hampered by the 
 limited amount of patients treated in this study (n=178), but would suggest that inr was generally 
 adequately controlled taking into account the required warfarin dose-reduction prior to initiating 
 sitaxentan treatment and subsequent inr monitoring according to clinical practice. an initial 
 anticoagulant dose reduction will also be necessary for other vitamin k antagonists that are cyp2c9 
 dependent in their metabolism (i.e., acenocoumarol, fenprocoumon and fluindione), which has been 
 reflected in the spc. notably, one patient with an inr above 3.5 in the sitaxentan 300 mg group of 
 study fph01-x did not receive warfarin. the finding was unexplained. in the long-term treatment a 
 significant increase was found only at one visit and a slight increase at the following one. since there 
 was no obvious drug related rationale, the applicant suggested that the finding was possibly due to a 
 sampling error. a direct effect of sitaxentan on inr is not suggested by this finding.</p><p>
 semen and male fertility hormone evaluations 
 in pre-clinical studies conducted in rats, mild focal abnormalities (atrophic seminiferous tubules) were 
 observed in the testes of adult rats. in contrast, studies with beagle dogs revealed no evidence for 
 similar testicular effects as observed in the rat. in view of these findings, semen samples from pah 
 patients were collected on a voluntary basis during the clinical program. no consistent adverse 
 sitaxentan treatment effects on the total motile sperm count (an indicator for male fertility status) or 
 hormone levels (fsh, inhibin-b, lh, testosterone) were observed, thereby providing no evidence for 
 widespread sitaxentan-induced atrophic tubules in pah patients. pre-clinical findings are reflected in 
 section 5.3 of the spc.</p><p>
 ecg/qt 
 a thorough qt study in healthy volunteers was performed comparing placebo, sitaxentan 100 and 
 1000 mg p.o.qd and moxifloxacin 8mg. neither the uncorrected qt values nor the qtci and the 
 qtcf values indicated a signal of concern. when applying the bazett’s correction the placebo 
 corrected upper 95% ci limit for sitaxentan 1000 mg is 11 ms. this is just above the range of 10 ms 
 that has been suggested as a criterion for a negative thorough qt study (ich e14 chmp/ich/2/04) 
 ensuring that a drug prolongs the mean qt/qtc interval by around 5 ms or less. this is not of 
 concern, however, and can be explained by an overcorrection using the bazett’s correction at a higher 
 hr.</p><p>similarly, the outlier analysis was unremarkable. electrocardiogram results from patients with 
 pah from study fph02, including heart rate, pr interval, qrs interval, qt interval, and qtcb 
 interval, were independently evaluated. overall, the ecg data did not indicate concerns regarding qt. 
 a specific analysis of ecg changes in patients with renal failure did neither indicate a correlation 
 between pharmacokinetics in these patients nor a clinical concern.</p><p>
 • discontinuation due to adverse events</p><p>
 in the phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in patients with pah, a large and comparable proportion of 
 patients treated with sitaxentan (92%), placebo (87%) or bosentan (85%) completed the studies. the 
 most common reasons for premature discontinuation in the all doses sitaxentan, sitaxentan 100 mg 
 qd, placebo and bosentan treatment groups were aes (2%, 0%, 3% and 3%, resp) and need for 
 additional chronic pah treatment (2%, 1%, 3% and 7%, resp). in the largest safety pool of all phase 2 
 and 3 oral studies in patients with pah, the overall ae-associated discontinuation rate was 
 comparable in the sitaxentan &gt;50 to ≤100 mg qd and placebo group (9% and 8%, resp), while being 
 higher in the bosentan group (15%). discontinuations due to cardiac disorders were infrequent across 
 all treatment groups at rates below 1.2%, but respiratory disorder-associated discontinuations were 
 generally more frequently observed at rates between 3.2%-4.8%. clinical investigations-related 
 discontinuations (mainly driven by hepatic function test abnormalities) occurred most often in the 
 bosentan group (placebo 1.3%, all doses sitaxentan 3.9%, sitaxentan &gt;50 to ≤100 mg qd 2.8%, 
 bosentan 4.8%). however, in view of small differences in incidences across treatment groups and a 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 27/37 
 low number of bosentan-treated patients, once again it is noted that these data should be cautiously interpreted.</p><p>
 • discontinuation of treatment</p><p>
 the potential for any sitaxentan withdrawal events was not formally assessed as part of the phase 3 
 clinical program. this was due to the fact that these effects are not usually expected with drugs that 
 take several weeks to show efficacy, and due to feedback from investigators involved in the initial 
 high dose tbc3711-211 study, as well as the fph01 and bosentan trials. however upon request this 
 point was further analyzed comparing the treatment-emergent aes reported by the final day of therapy 
 compared to those that occurred 24-72 hours beyond discontinuation.</p><p>the conclusion was that even 
 though it is impossible to be definitive with respect to a lack of withdrawal effects, the data continue 
 to support the opinion of the investigators that acute withdrawal effects are not a concern with 
 sitaxentan sodium or this class of drugs.</p><p>

 the name review group has required monitoring of potential medication errors with teolin, and as 
 such this has been reflected in the risk minimisation activities and has been included as a post-
 authorisation commitment.</p></section><section><header n="6">6 overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
  quality</header><p>there are no unresolved quality issues that could have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance. the quality of the product is satisfactory.</p></section><section><header>non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology</header><p>sitaxentan sodium is a highly selective eta receptor antagonist that has shown in several animal models to be effective for pulmonary hypertension. 
 overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that sitaxentan is effective 
 for pulmonary hypertension (pah) in response to hypoxia. the safety pharmacology studies using 
 rats, mice and dogs showed that the effects of sitaxentan on the renal, gastrointestinal and respiratory 
 system in different species had no major side effects.</p><p>
 the data obtained form the general pharmacokinetic point of view give a good picture of sitaxentan 
 kinetics at high doses in several different animal species, however there is no pk data at lower doses 
 i.e. for human application a dose of 100 mg/day. sitaxentan binds to high degree to plasma proteins, 
 and its metabolites are weak or potent inhibitors of cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and cyp3a4 activity, and 
 possibly of cyp2c8. sitaxentan may induce enzymes responsible for its own metabolism, and is 
 eliminated via hepatic and renal clearance. studies on interaction of sitaxentan with the hepatic 
 transporter protein and on the metabolite in fraction p8 are still to be performed as post authorisation 
 commitments to further elucidate the mechanism of action and possible toxicity of sitaxentan.</p><p>the results of the toxicology programme revealed that a qd administration was better tolerated than a 
 bid dosing regimen. dose-related liver changes (weight, centrilobular hypertrophy, occasionally 
 necrosis), induction of hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and slightly decreased erythron parameters 
 were seen in mice, rats and dogs. at high doses, dose-related increases in prothrombin time (pt) and 
 activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) were also seen, most prominently in rats, and 
 coagulopathy (bleedings) in rats and dogs, but not mice. the significance of these findings for humans 
 is unknown. genotoxicity studies both in vivo and in vitro did not provide any evidence for a 
 clinically relevant genotoxic potential. carcinogenicity studies gave negative results when conducted 
 for 97-99 weeks in rats, and for 6 months in p53
 (+/-) transgenic mice.</p><p>reproductive toxicology was evaluated only in rats where considerable teratogenicity was observed. 
 this was seen at the lowest tested dose, corresponding in rats at exposures more than 30 times the 
 human exposure. since lower doses have not been tested, it is not clear whether there is a safety 
 margin for human, and if the teratogenic effects observed represent a class effect of endothelin 
 receptor antagonists. thus far, bosentan is the only registered et receptor antagonist. available 
 preclinical information is insufficient to compare the reproduction toxicity findings of sitaxentan with 
 those of bosentan. there are no data on the use of sitaxentan in pregnant women, but there is a need to 
 treat hypertensive women of child bearing potential, also in situations when other treatment 
 alternatives are not suitable. following with these data the discussion scheme in the discussion paper 
 on contraindications in pregnancy, it is concluded that there is no need to contraindicate sitaxentan 
 sodium in pregnancy.</p><p>medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 33/37 
 sitaxentan sodium is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under the age of 18 years. to further investigate its use in the children population, the mah will perform a paediatric clinical 
 programme as a post-authorisation commitment. the mah has also agreed to perform a phototoxicity 
 study as part of the post-authorisation commitments in order to evaluate the possibility that the 
 increased number of skin tumours could be related to phototoxicity.</p><p>repeated-dose toxicity studies and the carcinogenicity study did not reveal any concern regarding a possible immunotoxic effect of sitaxentan.</p><p>
 finally, no ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (era) has been performed as the current draft “note for guidance on the environmental risk assessment” waives the need for era in orphan 
 drugs.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>the main randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with pah were fph01, fph02 and fph04.</p><p>all the patients included in these 
 studies had pah ranging from nyha/who functional class ii to iv, and presented primary, ctd-
 associated, or chd-associated pah.</p><p>the primary efficacy endpoint in fph01 was the change from 
 baseline to week 12 in percent of predicted peak oxygen uptake (vo
 2). in the other two pivotal trials the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 18 in the 6-minute walk test 
 distance. these studies were not designed to evaluate long-term efficacy of sitaxentan or to 
 demonstrate improved survival. at present, combination studies with non-conventional pah 
 treatments have not been performed, but a clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 
 sitaxentan and sildenafil (revatio
 ®) in co-administration is has been committed to as a follow up measure</p><p>
 results on study fph02 are considered of main importance, since this study included a sufficient 
 amount of patients per treatment group (n=60), adjucated the 6-minute walk test as a primary 
 endpoint, and incorporated a bosentan active-control arm as well for descriptive purpose. the 
 improvement in 6-minute walk test distance showed dose dependency in this study, and a 
 statistically significant moderate improvement in 6-minute walk test distance was noted with 
 sitaxentan 100 mg qd compared to placebo. the results were generally confirmed in study fph01 
 also conducted in a predominantly caucasian who functional class iii primary and ctd-associated 
 pah population, showing a comparable placebo-corrected improvement with sitaxentan 100 mg qd 
 at 12 weeks. the alternative primary endpoint in fph01 reflecting maximal aerobic capacity was 
 shown to be of questionable validity as it was not consistent with the relative improvements in 6-
 minute walk test distance on sitaxentan.</p><p>
 the third pivotal study, fph04, was conducted in a different population of mainly non-caucasian 
 patients with a lesser disease severity (who functional class ii). a smaller placebo-corrected 
 improvement with sitaxentan 100 mg qd was noted in study fph04 compared to studies fph01 and 
 fph02, consistent with an assumption of disease severity-related efficacy. across studies, sitaxentan 
 50 mg qd showed insufficient efficacy, while sitaxentan 300 mg qd showed no larger efficacy 
 compared to sitaxentan 100 mg qd</p><p> 
 overall, the relative improvement in exercise capacity (6-minute walk test distance) with sitaxentan 
 100 mg qd versus placebo appears to be clinically relevant, in view of a numerically comparable 
 relative improvement observed with the previously licensed medicinal product bosentan. as expected 
 in a rare disease, non-inferiority has not been formally demonstrated.</p><p>
 sitaxentan’s efficacy was generally consistent in subgroups according to sex, race, age, weight, and 
 region. no reliable conclusions could be drawn in patients below 18 years of age, and as such 
 treatment is not recommended under this age. the mah has agreed to develop a clinical paediatric 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 34/37 
 programme to address the lack of safety and efficacy data. the data from the subgroup analyses did not provide compelling evidence for a clinically relevant treatment effect in patients with chd-
 associated pah that offsets the significant safety risk associated with sitaxentan, limiting the 
 therapeutic indication to primary pulmonary arterial hypertension and pah associated to connective 
 tissue disease. a discrepancy between the expected baseline walking distance for patients in who 
 functional class ii and the reported mean baseline walking distance for patients in class ii in the 
 clinical programme was also observed. the findings raise doubts on the representativeness of the 
 enrolled class ii population for patients with class ii disease severity in clinical practice. in addition, 
 the improvement with sitaxentan 100 mg qd versus placebo in patients with who class ii disease 
 severity was small, and the conclusion reached was that the data do not allow who class ii patients to 
 be included in the therapeutic indication for sitaxentan.</p><p>
 further supportive efficacy data were obtained from the long-term safety studies fph01-x, fph02-x 
 and fph03. overall, these studies suggested maintenance of sitaxentan’s efficacy up to 28 weeks of 
 treatment.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>across all phase 2 and 3 studies in patients with pah, 899 patients had been treated with sitaxentan with a mean exposure of 29 weeks.</p><p>
 the most common drug reactions considered to be at least possibly related to sitaxentan treatment 
 were headache (15%), peripheral oedema (9%) and nasal congestion (9%).</p><p>
 identified risks, appropriately addressed in the submitted risk management plan, include hepatic 
 toxicity, reductions in haemoglobin, bleeding events, teratogenicity, oatp interaction with sitaxentan 
 sodium, and pulmonary oedema. the key safety issue is the hepatic toxicity. cases of symptomatic 
 hepatitis have occurred in patients receiving sitaxentan 100 mg once daily. as the effect of liver 
 impairment on the pharmacokinetics is not clear and non-linear pharmacokinetics may result in 
 disproportionately higher plasma concentrations of sitaxentan in patients with liver impairment, 
 sitaxentan should not be used in patients with impaired liver function. the data suggest that the 
 hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan is at a comparable level versus bosentan, although firm conclusions 
 should not be drawn on the basis of these limited data obtained so far. the underlying mechanism of 
 hepatotoxicity remains unclear at present. the spc contains contra-indications, warnings, and strict 
 monitoring plus stopping rules related to hepatic function. also, sitaxentan will be distributed using a 
 controlled access system and hepatotoxicity will be monitored in a post-marketing surveillance 
 system.</p><p>
 from the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
 summary of product characteristics.</p><p>
 having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the chmp considered that the 
 proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.</p><p>
 all the information has been appropriately translated into the package leaflet for which a user test has 
 been adequately performed.</p></section><section><header>risk-benefit assessment</header><p>the clinical programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of sitaxentan in a population of patients with mainly primary and connective tissue disease (ctd)-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension 
 (pah) at who functional class ii and iii. overall, the relative improvement in exercise capacity (6-
 minute walk test distance) with sitaxentan 100 mg qd versus placebo (~33 meters) is considered 
 clinically relevant, in view of a numerically comparable relative improvement observed with the 
 previously licensed medicinal product bosentan (30 meters) in a head-to-head comparison. as 
 medicinal product no longer authorised ©emea 2006</p><p> 35/37 
 expected in a rare disease, non-inferiority has not been formally demonstrated. the placebo-corrected improvement in the subgroup of patients dominated by those with who class iii functional status was 
 46 meters. the findings were generally supported by results on the secondary endpoints change in 
 who functional classification and rate on clinical worsening. however, the efficacy demonstrated in 
 patients with who class ii functional status and patients with chd-associated pah is considered 
 insufficient.</p><p>
 the limited amount of patients included in the clinical trial programme for this orphan drug 
 application has impact on the assessment of safety as these studies had low power to elucidate 
 potential clinically relevant differences in the occurrence of less frequent events, such as serious 
 adverse events and deaths. although the incidence of death and serious adverse events with sitaxentan 
 100 mg qd relative to placebo and bosentan raised no major safety concern, any claim towards 
 reduction of mortality in pah patients treated according to the current standard of medical care 
 remains unjustified given the limited sample size and the absence of clinical outcome studies. 
 accordingly, no such claims are made in the currently proposed spc. safety concerns exist regarding 
 the occurrence of haemoglobin reductions and the potential for hepatotoxicity. limited safety data 
 suggested a reduced risk for aminotransferase elevations with sitaxentan 100 mg qd compared to 
 bosentan under the protocol-specified monitoring and stopping rules for sitaxentan-treated patients, 
 but its clinical relevance remains to be established in the absence of a demonstration of a reduced risk 
 for hepatic failure. cases of symptomatic hepatitis have occurred in patients receiving sitaxentan 100 
 mg once daily. some further safety concerns exist regarding the interaction with frequently used 
 cyp2c9-dependent anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, acenocoumarol) and associated bleeding events. 
 these safety issues are addressed in the spc and the risk management plan.</p><p>
 overall, the data suggest that oral sitaxentan 100 mg qd has a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the 
 non-selective endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan. the benefit/risk ratio relative to other 
 authorised medicinal products for the indication of pah is difficult to assess, since no direct 
 comparative data on clinical efficacy are available besides bosentan. posology advantages apply over 
 the indwelling catheter needed for continuous intravenous administration of epoprostenol (risk for 
 infection and sepsis), the subcutaneous administration of treprostinil, and the frequent daily 
 inhalations required for iloprost (6-9 times a day). no significant safety advantage over the oral 
 medicinal product sildenafil would be expected given sitaxentan’s potential for hepatotoxicity 
 requiring strict monitoring. given the difference in mechanism of action between the oral agents 
 sitaxentan and sildenafil, a clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of co-
 administration was considered necessary.</p><p>
 it was concluded that sitaxentan sodium could be approvable for patients with primary pulmonary 
 arterial hypertension and ctd-associated pah in who/nyha class iii disease severity. the chmp, 
 having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition 
 to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety
