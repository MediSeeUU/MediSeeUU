 the mah sets up a surveillance programme to collect information on: the demographics of patients 
 prescribed thelin, any adverse reactions and reasons for discontinuation of thelin and that this 
 surveillance programme is put in place prior to marketing of the product.</p><p>
 the mah agrees the details of a controlled distribution system with the national competent authority 
 and implements such a programme nationally to ensure that, prior to prescribing, all doctors who 
 intend to prescribe thelin are provided with a physician information pack containing the following:</p><p>
 • product information • physician information about thelin • patient information card • partner of patient information card</p><p>
 the physician information about thelin should contain the following key elements:</p><p>
 • that thelin is teratogenic</p><p>o need for pregnancy testing prior to first and subsequent prescriptions o use of effective contraception in women of child bearing age o possible interaction with oral contraceptives and increased risk of thromboembolism o need to advise female patients about teratogenicity, need for pregnancy testing and contraception, what to do if they become pregnant</p><p>
 o referral of patients who become pregnant to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology and its diagnosis for evaluation and advice</p><p>
 • that thelin is hepatotoxic o need for liver function tests prior to and during treatment o contraindication in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease o discontinue sitaxentan sodium immediately if liver enzymes rise above 5 x uln o need for close monitoring if liver enzymes measure between 3 and 5 x uln, with discontinuation if a repeat analysis is above 3 x uln, and not restarted until levels 
 have returned to below 3 x uln</p><p>
 • that treatment with thelin often causes a decrease in haemoglobin and related red cell parameters 
 o need for full blood count prior to use and monitoring at clinically appropriate intervals</p><p>
 • that there is an increased risk of bleeding with thelin o interaction with warfarin and vitamin k antagonists leading to an increased inr</p><p>o need to decrease established dose of vitamin k antagonist upon starting sitaxentan therapy</p><p>
 o start vitamin k antagonists treatment at a reduced dose if already on sitaxentan sodium 
 o need for regular monitoring of inr</p><p>o co-prescription with sildenafil may increase the risk of haemorrhage</p><p>o be aware of the potential for haemorrhage and investigate as appropriate</p><p>
 • that there is an interaction with cyclosporin a which may lead to higher blood concentration of thelin and hence an increased risk of adverse reactions.</p><p>3 • that the safety database of thelin is limited and physicians are encouraged to enrol patients in a surveillance programme to increase knowledge about the incidence of important adverse 
 drug reactions (adrs).</p><p>the surveillance programme should prompt doctors to report serious 
 adrs and certain selected adrs as below immediately and other non-serious adrs at three 
 monthly intervals. 
 the information collected should include: 
 o anonymised patient details – age, sex and aetiology of pah o concomitant medications o reason for discontinuation o adrs • all serious adrs • increase in hepatic enzymes to &gt; 3 x uln • anaemia • haemorrhage • pregnancy and outcome • pulmonary oedema • suspected interactions • unexpected adrs according to the spc.</p><p>
 the patient information card should include the following information 
 • that thelin is teratogenic • the need for a negative pregnancy test immediately prior to first prescription</p><p>• the need to ensure that women of child bearing age are using effective contraception and that patients should inform their doctors of any possibility of pregnancy before a new prescription 
 is issued 
 • the need for female patients to contact their treating doctor immediately if they suspect that they might be pregnant. 
 • that thelin is hepatotoxic and they will need to attend for regular blood tests • that thelin may cause bleeding • the need to tell their doctor about any adverse events • the need to tell health care practitioners that they are taking thelin</p><p>
 partner of patient information card should include the following information: 
 • that thelin is teratogenic and that women of child bearing age must use effective contraception</p></section></body></xml>
