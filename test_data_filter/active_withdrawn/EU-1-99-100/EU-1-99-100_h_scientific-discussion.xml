 introduction</header><p>for treatment of infertility in female patients with non-functional fallopian tubes, reconstructive surgery has been the only therapy for many years. since new treatment possibilities have been 
 developed over the past 20 years, including in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer (ivf-et) for 
 infertility treatment in women with non-functional fallopian tubes, and intracytoplasmatic sperm 
 injection (icsi).</p><p>
 pharmacological stimulation of follicular growth and ovulation induction are essential for production 
 of high quality oocytes. assisted reproduction techniques (art) are used to help couples with fertility 
 problems. the process is preceded by controlled ovarian stimulation (cos) with human menopausal 
 gonadotropin (hmg) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). human menopausal gonadotropin, 
 containing fsh and lh, is used for stimulation of follicular growth, recombinant fsh (rec-fsh) has 
 also been licensed for this indication. human chorionic gonadotropin in doses of 5000 to 10000 iu is 
 used to trigger ovulation in stimulated cycles. a premature lh surge and premature ovulation may 
 lead to cancellation of the stimulated cycle. in order to avoid a premature lh surge, pituitary down 
 regulation is employed in most centers. 
 the role of a hypothalamic peptide factor controlling the release of the gonadotropin luteinising 
 hormone (lh) and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) was established in the early 1970&apos;s. since then 
 many analogues of gonadotropin releasing hormones (gnrh or lhrh) have been synthesised to 
 enhance the stability and affinity of the natural peptide which has a very short half-life (3-6 minutes). 
 for pituitary down regulation, chronic administration of these agonists results in a desensitisation 
 (down regulation) of pituitary receptors and inhibition of gonadotropin and sex steroid secretion 
 leading to a selective medical hypophysectomy and a so-called chemical castration. gnrh agonist 
 treatment (often as a depot preparation) is started in the luteal phase of the cycle preceeding the 
 treatment (stimulation) cycle. the routine use of gnrh agonists prior to in vitro fertilisation / embryo 
 transfer and gamete intrafallopian transfer results in a lower cancellation rate of cycles suggesting an 
 improved pregnancy rate.</p><p>
 lhrh-antagonists were also used instead of the agonists. they are devoid of the initial stimulation 
 (flare up) and the treatment period can be shorter. a sufficient follicular stimulation may be achieved 
 with lower doses of gonadotropins (hmg). however, many of the antagonists provoked histamine 
 release, edema of the face and extremities, and anaphylactic reactions in rats and humans. 
 cetrorelix, a decapeptide with a sequence derived from lhrh, is a lhrh-antagonist. it effectively 
 inhibits the release of lh from the pituitary gland; sex hormone levels are suppressed to castration 
 levels in men and women. two different dosages have been investigated: multiple doses of 0.25 mg 
 once daily and a single dose of 3 mg cetrorelix.</p></section><section><header n="2">2. chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
 composition</header><p>cetrotide is presented as lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection containing cetrorelix acetate equivalent respectively to 0.25 and 3.0 mg cetrorelix base. the main excipient consists of 
 mannitol. acetic acid and water for injection were used during the manufacturing process. prior to 
 subcutaneous injection, the powders are for reconstitution with 1 ml or 3 ml of water for injection, 
 which are available in pre-filled syringes. all components with the exception of the active substance 
 comply with relevant ph.eur. monographs. the composition of batches used in clinical trials is only 
 different from the intended market formulation in the quantity of cetrorelix and mannitol. no overage 
 of the active substance is introduced.</p><p> 2/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 container</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>the primary packaging material proposed for lyophilisated powders is type i glass vials (2 ml or 4 ml) closed with a brombutyl rubber stopper and protected with an aluminium cap. the 
 brombutyl rubber is stabilised against oxidation. the quality of vials and rubber stoppers meet with 
 ph.eur. requirements, which has been confirmed by full specification with description of test methods 
 used. the pre-filled syringes (type i glass cartridge closed with rubber stoppers) used for water for 
 injection has already been authorised in some member states and are of acceptable quality. however, 
 the shelf-life should be restricted to that agreed for the finished product. 
 pharmaceutical development</p></section><section><header>-</header><p>cetrorelix acetate is thermally labile and unstable in aqueous solution, therefore sterilisation by filtration and lyophilisation (freeze-drying) are considered to be justified. 
 cetrorelix in solution tends to aggregate and gel. mannitol was chosen for building up an acceptable 
 solid cake. in addition, it prevents sublimation during lyophilisation and guarantees an isotonic 
 solution after reconstitution with water for injection. the mannitol concentration was fixed and 
 optimised in the finished dosage form in order to obtain an isotonic solution after reconstitution for 
 parenteral use.</p></section><section><header>active substance</header><p>cetrorelix acetate is a linear decapeptide with a molecular weight of 1431, which comprises five l-amino and five d-amino acids including 1-2 mol acetic acid par 1 mol peptide. it is a white amorphous 
 powder and hygroscopic. its solubility in water and in water/mannitol is approximately</p><p>
 8 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml, respectively. 
 cetrorelix acetate presents no polymorphic forms. the evidence of its chemical structure has been 
 adequately confirmed by the pathway of synthesis, by characterisation of the structure of the isolated 
 key intermediates and of the active substance itself by elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods (esi-
 ms, h
 1nmr, c13nmr, ir and uv), x-ray diffraction, optical rotation. deduction of amino acid sequence and enantiomeric analysis were also performed to provide further supportive evidence of 
 chemical structure. 
 cetrorelix acetate is manufactured by approximately a 26-step synthesis with satisfactory in-process 
 control of intermediates applied at key steps throughout. hplc method was used for final purification. 
 potential impurities have been considered, including a possible by-product of racemisation during 
 synthesis, related substances, paladium and residual solvents. specifications have been set for the 
 synthesis starting materials and intermediates. they are in line with batch release data and batches 
 used in preclinical and clinical studies. the sum of four stereoisomeric peptide impurities, which 
 cannot be completely resolved altogether by hplc, is specified as no more than 0.1%. acceptable 
 limits of 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, were set for the sum of unknown impurities and the total sum of 
 impurities. residual solvents are also specified at a suitable level in agreement with cpmp/ich 
 guidance. appropriate microbiological control is performed with a suitable limit for bioburden. all 
 analytical methods for starting materials and intermediates have been adequately validated. batch 
 analysis data indicate suitable uniformity and batch-to-batch consistency.</p><p>
 the active substance in solid state was tested for up to 18 months under different temperatures and 
 relative humidities. it was also stressed in solution, under the influence of ph, temperature and 
 oxidative conditions. increase of water can be observed, but chemical and microbiological stability 
 was not affected. photostability testing was adequately carried out. potential degradation products 
 remain within the proposed specifications. overall, the data support the re-test period of 18 months 
 under the proposed storage conditions.</p></section><section><header>other ingredients</header><p>the manufacture of water for injection was carried-out in a 6-step distillation process. satisfactory information has been provided on the excipients which are all of ph.eur. quality.</p><p> 3/12 emea 2004</p></section><section><header>product development and finished product</header><p>manufacture, control and validation - bulk solution is filtered and pre-sterilisation is applied. aseptic filling into sterile and depyrogenised vials is performed with a second sterile filtration before filling, 
 then lyophilisation of the solution under aseptic conditions is carried-out. the vials are fitted with 
 sterile stoppers and caps. visual control of all vials is performed. 
 in-process controls are set up and their parameters are specified. aseptic filling process and routine 
 environmental controls are also performed and validated. relevant microbiological control includes 
 bioburden of the solution prior to filtration. maximum holding times are validated. 
 the critical stages in the manufacturing process have been validated. results from production scale 
 batch analyses showed that all batches complied with specifications and demonstrated acceptable batch 
 to batch consistency.</p><p>
 product specification - the specification for content of active substance at release is 95 – 105% of the nomination value, and at least 90% at the end of shelf-life. content uniformity is in accordance with 
 the ph.eur. requirement. related impurities are controlled at release and end of shelf-life based on 
 batch analytical results and stability results, and validated with reference to preclinical studies.</p><p>
 other tests include ph, colour, average filling, turbidity of reconstituted solution, water and acetate 
 content, bacterial endotoxin and sterility. in addition, injectable amount with regard to withdrawal 
 volume has been investigated and mentioned in the spc. all control methods have been validated in a 
 satisfactory way.</p></section><section><header>stability of the product</header><p>stability data up to 24 months are available for 3 batches of each strength. different storage conditions have been studied: -10ºc, 8ºc, 25ºc/60%rh and 30ºc/70%rh (for up to 24 months), 40ºc/75%rh (6 
 months) and light cabinet (3 months). results have been generated by validated methods and support 
 the (un-opened) shelf-life stated in the spc, i.e. 2 years when stored at temperatures below to 25
 °c in the outer carton. in addition, after reconstitution stability tests were conducted, which indicate that 
 both formulations, as mentioned in the spc, should be used immediately. 
 in summary, cetrotide 0.25 mg and 3 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection are conventionally formulated and manufactured using standard pharmaceutical technology. the chemical-
 pharmaceutical dossier is adequately documented and generally acceptable. the company was 
 however requested to provide, within the agreed timeframe, additional information/data which have 
 not been satisfactorily resolved; these are defined in the follow-up measures as listed in the company&apos;s 
 undertaking letter (see section ii.3 of this report).</p></section><section><header n="3">3. toxico-pharmacological aspects 
 pharmacodynamics</header><p>cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist, which competes reversibly with the hormone in binding to the membrane receptors on pituitary cells. due to this mode of action, 
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of two gonadotropins luteinising hormone (lh) and 
 to a lesser degree, follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) from the pituitary gland in mice, rats and 
 cynomolgus monkeys. the onset of suppression is almost immediate and there is no apparent initial 
 stimulatory effect, i.e. no “flare-up”. the suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and has 
 been shown to be reversible after discontinuation of the treatment. given in sufficiently high doses, a 
 reversible cessation of reproductive function is observed in both female and male animals. 
 cetrorelix binds with high affinity to lhrh receptors, and labelled lhrh was shown to be displaced 
 from the two classes of lhrh receptors by the compound. 
 in vitro, cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibited the lhrh-mediated lh release in perfused rat pituitary cell systems. further, in a recently 
 established 
 in vitro assay, cetrorelix proved to be a high affinity antagonist at the lhrh-receptor and dose-dependently blocked the signal transduction induced by lhrh. 
 in vivo, cetrorelix effectively blocked ovulation in female rats. it suppressed the preovulatory lh-peak as well as the fsh-peaks. cetrorelix markedly decreased plasma lh concentrations and to a lesser</p><p> 4/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 degree fsh concentrations in ovariectomized female rats. all effects were reversible. in castrated male rats, cetrorelix induced a dose dependent suppression of the secretion of lh. high doses resulted in a 
 dramatic fall of serum testosterone to castration levels at 6 hours after injection in intact males. 
 thereafter, testosterone levels only slowly recovered. even though the initial fall of plasma 
 testosterone requires rather high doses of cetrorelix, complete and continuous suppression can be 
 maintained by remarkably lower maintenance doses. cetrorelix was also able to block lhrh-agonist 
 induced lh response in male rats. the lhrh-antagonistic effects of cetrorelix were confirmed in the 
 primate 
 macaca fascicularis. the main metabolite of cetrorelix in the rat bile was identified as being the heptapeptide(1-7). this 
 metabolite was pharmacologically inactive in rats, in terms of testosterone suppression. 
 cetrorelix produced growth inhibition in both the rat dmba breast cancer model and mouse mxt 
 mammary adenocarcinoma model. in addition, the efficacy of cetrorelix was confirmed in 
 other in vitro</p><p>and in vivo tumor models, e.g. chemically-induced pancreatic cancer, hormone-independent prostatic cancer, human ovarian- and endometrial cancer models. 
 the histamine releasing potential of cetrorelix is very low. cetrorelix caused histamine release from 
 isolated rat mast cells only after concentrations of &gt;0.9 
 µg/ml. in clinical situations, single s.c. doses of 3 mg of cetrorelix produce plasma levels of about 30 ng/ml. no limiting anaphylactoid reactions were 
 observed within preclinical testing. 
 cetrorelix shows a favourable safety-profile. it had no effects on the cardio-vascular parameters of 
 pigs. similarly, no effects on the respiratory function of anaesthetised guinea pigs or rats were 
 observed. furthermore, cetrorelix induced no gastric erosions in rats and was devoid of effects on the 
 gastro-intestinal transit, spontaneous motor activity and motor co-ordination in mice. 
 cetrorelix had no effect on the hexobarbital-induced or ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex in male 
 mice. no other preclinical drug interaction studies have been performed.</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p>pharmacokinetic studies were performed predominantly in rats and dogs. absorption from the s.c. injection site was rapid and complete and there were no differences in absorption with regard to sex or 
 species. a linear relationship between dose and plasma auc was evident. distribution of cetrorelix 
 was rapid. main target organs were the kidney, liver, small intestine and organs containing the lhrh 
 receptor (pituitary gland, ovaries). plasma protein binding amounted to 86%. elimination from most 
 tissues was rapid and occurred predominantly within 48h. half-lives of 
 ≥100 h were observed mainly in organs of elimination (liver, kidney), spleen and in the organs containing lhrh binding sites. 
 cetrorelix crosses the placenta only to a low extent. the distribution of cetrorelix or its metabolites 
 into milk was not investigated. cetrorelix is excreted unchanged into urine and after metabolism by 
 peptidases into bile. the terminal half-lives in rats after i.v. and s.c. administration were 1-2 h and 7-14 
 h, respectively, indicating that absorption is the rate limiting step for elimination. in humans, the 
 terminal half-life values after i.v. and s.c. administration were 8-9 h and 24-40 h, respectively. studies 
 in healthy volunteers indicate that cetrorelix is excreted in a similar manner in humans, rats and dogs. 
 no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the repeated-dose study and the 
 single-dose data were found. furthermore, no accumulation of cetrorelix occurred following repeated 
 s.c. administration.</p></section><section><header>toxicology</header><p>single dose toxicity of cetrorelix after oral and i.p. administration was studied in rats and mice. the acute oral toxicity was low. after i.p. injection, doses 
 ≥21.5 mg/kg caused reduced or slow movement, sunken sides, cyanosis of the skin and co-ordination disturbances. 68.1 mg/kg was determined as the 
 minimal lethal dose. 
 repeated-dose toxicity in the five repeated-dose toxicity studies of up to 26 weeks, performed on rats and dogs, daily s.c. injections of up to 0.5 mg/kg of cetrorelix were well tolerated. no particular organ 
 toxicity was determined. all observed changes appeared to be related to the pharmacological action of 
 cetrorelix and, thus are secondary to suppression of hormone levels. minimal local irritant effects at 
 the injection sites are partially related to a deposition and an accumulation of the drug in macrophages. 
 all the findings were reversible or tended to be reversed during off-dose.</p><p> 5/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 genotoxicity standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests was carried out. no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential was found and it can be concluded that cetrorelix will not exert 
 genotoxic activities under therapeutic conditions. 
 carcinogenicity no carcinogenicity studies have been performed. reproductive and development toxicity studies cetrorelix expectedly induced a dose-related suppression of fertility, reproductive performance and pregnancy in female rats and a dose-related 
 suppression of fertility in male rats. the effects were reversible after cessation of treatment. no 
 treatment-related foetal abnormalities were detected in rats or in rabbits when the drug was 
 administered during the relative sensitive phase of organogenesis. 
 local tolerance i.v., s.c. and intramuscular injections to beagle dogs were generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant signs of local irritation. 
 special toxicity studies cetrorelix did not induce sensitisation in the guinea pig maximization test. summary and conclusion on preclinical pharmacology and toxicology: cetrorelix is a potent antagonist of lhrh in various in vitro and animal models and binds competitively and with high affinity to pituitary lhrh-receptors. the subsequent lh-suppression is 
 induced within a few hours after the start of treatment and thus avoids the flare-up effect. a dose-
 dependent and reversible suppression of the secretion of gonadotropins, especially lh, from the 
 pituitary gland ensues resulting in a cessation of reproductive function both in female and male 
 animals. 
 cetrorelix shows a favourable safety-profile and no limiting anaphylactoid reactions were observed 
 during preclinical testing. the pharmacokinetics of cetrorelix have been well characterised in rats and 
 dogs. findings in toxicity studies appear to be related to the pharmacological actions of cetrorelix and 
 are thus secondary to suppression of hormone levels. no teratogenicity was detected and mutagenicity 
 tests were also negative. no carcinogenicity studies have been performed and none are necessary given 
 the short duration of intended use. the doses used in repeated-dose and reproductive toxicity studies 
 provide an acceptable safety margin, in terms of c
 max and auc, for the proposed dose regimen. overall, the risk-benefit ratio is considered positive and the preclinical data revealed no special risk for 
 human.</p></section><section><header n="4">4. clinical aspects</header><p>the core clinical programme, consisting of 9 phase ii/iii clinical studies where a total of 878 patients were given cetrorelix acetate (cet), was aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of cet for the 
 prevention of premature ovulation in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by 
 assisted reproductive techniques (cos/art). there were four exploratory studies (0008, 0009b, 0012 
 and ic93005), two dose finding studies (2986 and 2997) and three therapeutic confirmatory studies 
 (3010, 3020 and 3030).</p><p>in addition, a total of 14 phase i clinical pharmacology studies were 
 submitted, where 137 healthy males and 71 healthy females were enrolled. studies were performed in 
 accordance with gcp standards.</p><p>due to the nature of the treatments and the manner of use of this medicinal product, most studies were 
 open label. both single and multiple dose regimens were investigated. 
 (1)</p></section><section><header>human pharmacology</header><p>(2)</p></section><section><header>pharmacodynamics</header><p>- cetrotide (cet) is a lhrh antagonist which competes with endogenous lhrh for receptors on pituitary cells. the evidence for receptor binding was derived 
 from animal studies. the effect of cetrorelix in healthy male or female volunteers was investigated in</p><p>
 8 pharmacodynamic studies. 
 in female volunteers (at doses of cetrorelix 0.25 and 0.5 mg) a rapid dose dependent suppression of 
 lh, fsh and estradiol (e
 2) were observed, the duration of the effect (suppression of lh) was up to 12 hours and increased with increasing dosages. single dose administration (3.0 or 5.0 mg) during the 
 early follicular phase (estradiol exceeded 150 pg/ml) delayed the spontaneous lh surge by at least</p><p>
 3 days. repeated administration (0.5 or 1.0 mg cetrorelix) resulted in constant suppression of lh, fsh</p><p> 6/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 and an estradiol nadir of 12 pg/ml, whereas during repeated administration of 0.25 mg cetrorelix, lh and estradiol were suppressed initially and then tended to increase. 
 in male volunteers the suppressive effect of cetrorelix on lh, fsh and testosterone was observed, both 
 with single doses (0.25 and up to 5.0 mg) and multiple doses (up to 10.0 mg). these effects were dose-
 related. at the higher dose of 10 mg, the testosterone suppression reached castration level</p><p>
 (&lt;2 mmol/l). after 3 mg cetrorelix, the resulting suppression of lh was more than 50 % decrease from 
 baseline and the testosterone suppression lasted 30 hours. the duration of suppression was dose 
 dependent. 
 gnrh stimulation was not totally suppressed by cetrorelix, but gnrh stimulation of fsh was less 
 pronounced following treatment with cetrorelix. the higher doses of 15 and 20 mg did not enhance the 
 suppressive effect. the most common adverse events observed in phase i studies were local injection 
 site reactions. there was also some suggestion of decrease in systolic as well as diastolic blood 
 pressure and an increase in heart rate in the phase i studies.</p><p>
 (3)</p></section><section><header>pharmacokinetics</header><p> - cetrorelix in human plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay, and hplc was employed for measurement in urine. these methods were adequately validated. 
 following subcutaneous injection, the absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix was approximately 85% in 
 both males and females. the apparent volume of distribution was 1.16 ± 0.29 l/kg in females and</p><p>
 1.02 ± 0.33 l/kg in males. the terminal half-life (t
 1/2) was about 10 hours after i.v. and 30 hours after subcutaneous injection with a trend towards lower values in female. protein binding in human plasma 
 was around 85%. linear pharmacokinetics were observed following both single (0.25, 0.5 and</p><p>
 1.00 mg) and multiple dose administration (0.25 to 1.00 mg). the pharmacokinetics were linear up to a 
 3 mg dose. 
 cetrorelix is metabolised by peptidases. small amounts of metabolites (1-9 nonapeptide,</p><p>
 1-7 heptapeptide, 1-6 heptapeptide and 1-4 tetrapeptide) were detected in animal urine (rat, dog) in 
 addition to unchanged cet, whereas only unchanged cet has been detected in human urine. 
 following subcutaneous injection, 3.5-4.0% of the administered dose appeared unchanged in urine, no 
 potential metabolite (1-7 heptapeptide) was detected. no indication of accumulation has been reported. 
 pharmacokinetic studies in special populations (i.e. elderly, children, subject with moderate to severe 
 renal or hepatic impairment) have not been performed. use in elderly and subjects with moderate to 
 severe renal and hepatic impairment are contraindicated in the spc. due to the nature of its indication, 
 cetrotide is unlikely to be used in children. 
 there were no data on drug interactions. interactions with hmg and hcg have not been observed, 
 plasma levels of cetrorelix during follicular stimulation did not differ from plasma levels in healthy 
 individuals. 
 in vitro investigations indicated no evidence of cetrorelix metabolism by cytochrome p450 enzymes, glucuronyltransferases or other conjugating enzymes.</p></section><section><header>efficacy</header><p>in all phase ii/iii studies, the therapeutic procedure for controlled ovarian stimulation (cos) was nearly identical. in the phase iii studies treatment with hmg started on day 2 of the menstrual cycle 
 with daily doses of 150 iu hmg (2 ampoules, each containing 75 iu fsh and 75 iu lh) given i.m.</p><p>
 from day 6 of hmg treatment, the dose of hmg was adjusted according to follicular maturation 
 criteria. on the same day the first dose of cetrorelix was given s.c. into the lower abdominal wall 
 around the umbilicus. in case of daily cetrorelix administration the last dose was given on the day of 
 hcg. as soon as at least one follicle with a diameter of 20 mm was observed or e
 2 exceeded 1200 pg/ml, treatment with hmg was stopped and hcg 10000 iu were administered i.m. oocyte retrieval 
 took place 30-36 hours later 
 patient population – healthy female partners of infertile couples aged between 18 and 39 years (suffering from sterility due to tubal dysfunction) were included. further inclusion criteria were a 
 normal menstrual cycle (24-35 days), normal uterus and at least one functioning ovary, patients with 
 elevated fsh levels at screening were excluded. the usual exclusion criteria for art were applied. 
 efficacy parameters – the primary endpoint in most studies was prevention of premature lh surge (defined in terms of lh &gt; 10 iu/l and prog &gt; 1ng/ml) but the definition of lh surge varied between 
 different study protocols.</p><p> 7/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 in therapeutic confirmatory studies (i.e. 3010 and 3020), the primary objective was the prevention of premature lh surges defined in terms of lh and progesterone (prog) levels. the statistical section 
 of the protocol indicated that a patient will be considered as a responder &quot;if hcg day is reached&quot; 
 (meaning administration of hcg) and it will be the primary variable. 
 secondary variables comprised endocrine profiles of lh, fsh, e
 2 and prog during the procedure, number and size of follicles, number and quality of oocytes and embryos, duration of stimulation and 
 dose of hmg, outcome of the procedure in terms of pregnancy and birth rate, ovarian cyst formation 
 before stimulation period and luteal phase support.</p><p>
 pregnancy and delivery data after cos/art employing the lhrh-antagonist cetrorelix were also 
 analysed in 6 dose-finding phase ii (with a total of 229 patients receiving cetrorelix) and 3 phase iii 
 studies (649 patients receiving cetrorelix).</p></section><section><header>exploratory studies</header><p> - four exploratory studies (0008, 0009b, 0012 and ic93005) were conducted using different dosage regimens of cet: single dose (3 mg or 5 mg) and multiple doses (0.5 mg or</p><p>
 1 mg/day; twice 3 or 5 mg; 1 and 3 mg/day followed by 5 mg or 1 mg/day). no lh surge was reported 
 in either dose group. there was no effect of cet on fsh, prog or e
 2.</p></section><section><header>dose finding -</header><p> two dose finding studies (2986, 2997) were conducted to evaluate the minimal effective single dose and the efficacy of multiple doses of cetrorelix to prevent premature ovulation in 
 patients undergoing cos/art.</p><p>
 a total of 65 patients were recruited (study 2986) to receive a single dose of either 2 or 3 mg cet. 
 while 3 mg dose was constantly effective in preventing lh surge after 4 days, the 2 mg dose effect 
 was not sustained showing a tendency of lh increase after 3 days.</p><p>
 in the multiple dose study (2997), ninety patients were included, who either received a starting dose of 
 0.5 mg/day (with eventually a down-titration to lower dose), 0.25 mg or 0.1 mg/day. none of the 
 patients in cet dose groups of 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg experienced lh surges while one patient in 0.1 mg 
 dose group showed an lh surge. hormonal levels of fsh, e
 2 and prog were not affected by cetrorelix. the minimal dose of 0.1 mg cetrorelix proved to be not sufficiently effective, and therefore 
 was no longer administered. 
 consequently, 0.25 mg cetrorelix was shown to be the minimum effective dose. two dosage regimens 
 were proposed for phase iii studies: (1) daily dose of 0.25 mg starting on day 5 or 6 of hmg; (2) a 
 single dose of 3 mg on day 7 of hmg, eventually followed by once daily 0.25 mg after 4 days. both 
 regimens are administered until ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>therapeutic confirmatory</header><p> - three multicentre prospective studies were conducted to support the claimed indication, one uncontrolled and two comparing cetrorelix (cet) and lhrh-agonists 
 (buserelin and triptorelin). numbers of patients were based on estimating the response rate on 
 cetrorelix, based on a target response rate of 95%, with a slightly larger 5% possible error. efficacy 
 evaluation based on the intention to treat (itt) population was given. the most frequent posology was 
 0.25 mg cetrorelix starting on day 6 of hmg (study 3020) (n=346) or on day 5-6 (study 3010) (n=188) 
 of hmg-stimulation. the single dose of 3 mg started on day 7 of hmg (study 3030) (n=115) or earlier, 
 when the e
 2-levels exceeded 400 pg/ml. the reference treatments were buserelin (bus) 0.15 mg intra-nasal administration four times daily (starting on day 18-22 of the preceding cycle) and triptorelin 
 (tri) 3.75 mg depot single intramuscular administrations. 
 study 3010 was a randomised, parallel group, controlled trial, which compared daily doses of cetrorelix with buserelin in the prevention of premature lh surges in patients undergoing cos/art. 
 a total of 293 patients were randomised and 273 patients were evaluable for efficacy on itt basis 
 (188 received cetrorelix and 85 buserelin). 
 the mean duration of cetrorelix treatment was 5.7 days. success rate, defined as absence of lh surge, 
 was 95.2% for cet group and 98% of patients on buserelin. on an itt basis and in terms of reaching 
 the day of hcg, the success rate was 96.3% in cet group and 90.6% in the buserelin group. increases 
 of lh above 10 iu/l without increase of progesterone occurred in 10.1% (19) of patients in the cet 
 group versus 4.7% (3) in the buserelin group. however, some of these lh increases did not lead to 
 failure to administer hcg or to complete fertilisation procedures, and hence they may not have clinical 
 significance. there was no effect of either treatment on fsh. in buserelin group, levels of lh and e

 were lower on hmg day 1 as well as day 6, but e2 levels were higher on the day of hcg which may be caused by a higher number of small follicles in this group.</p><p>
 study 3020 was an uncontrolled trial aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of daily doses of cetrorelix in prevention of premature lh surges during controlled ovarian stimulation. the multiple 
 dosing schedule used was similar to the study 3010. 
 the primary efficacy variable was defined as reaching the day of hcg but the rate of premature lh 
 surges was also analysed. overall, 352 patients were screened and 346 patients were evaluable as the 
 intention to treat population.</p><p>
 the mean duration of cetrorelix treatment was 5.7 days, with an average of 1 to 1.5 mg cetrorelix 
 administered. the duration of follicular stimulation was 10.4 (6-19) days. surges of lh were observed 
 in 12 patients of the itt population, in eight of which fertilisation and embryo transfer were possible 
 and one woman became pregnant. increase of lh (= 10 ui/l) without concomitant progesterone 
 increase was also observed in 27 patients. the success rate for absence of lh surge was 96.5%</p><p>and</p><p>for 
 reaching hcg day was 96.2% of itt analysis (with a lower bound for the 95% confidence limit of 
 94.1%, which is slightly below the targeted 95%)</p></section><section><header n="">.</header><p>a continuous and homogenous follicle development was observed between day 6 of hmg and the day of hcg. the number and quality of obtained embryos is in accordance with the results of controlled 
 studies. 
 study 3030 was a parallel group study comparing a single dose of cetrorelix and a triptorelin depot. a total of 169 patients was randomised. there were 151 patients (115 cetrorelix and 36 triptorelin) in the 
 itt analysis. a single dose of each treatment was given at different times in an open fashion. the 
 primary endpoint was planned to be the occurrence of premature lh surges defined in terms of lh and 
 progesterone levels and occurring after day 5 of hmg. 
 only 11 patients (9.6%) received one or two additional doses of cetrorelix 0.25 mg. the mean duration 
 of follicular stimulation was 9.4 days for the cetrorelix group and 10.7 days for the triptorelin group, 
 24.3 vs. 35.6 ampoules (mean) of hmg were administered. 
 levels of lh above 10 iu/l occurred in 18 patients in the cet group and in one patient in the tri 
 group. these lh increases in cet group were however observed before the administration of the 
 study medication but not after the administration of cetrorelix. taking the lh surge in terms of 
 luteinising hormone levels alone led to a response rate of 84.3% for cetrorelix. the itt incidence of 
 the responders was 97.4% in cet group and 97.2% in tri group.</p><p>
 on the day of hcg, the number of medium sized follicles (15-17 mm) was slightly higher in the 
 triptorelin group. no differences were observed between the groups concerning fsh, lh and prog, 
 but e
 2 levels on hcg day were higher in tri group which may be attributed to higher number of follicles in tri group.</p></section><section><header>luteal support</header><p> - in cos/art programmes using lhrh-agonists for down-regulation of endogenous gonadotrophin production, luteal phase support is generally recommended as it is believed that the 
 treatment may result in luteal phase defects. controlled ovarian stimulation (hmg and hcg) results in 
 a decrease of lh levels to the detection limit on the day of embryo transfer (et), this has been shown 
 in patients treated with cetrorelix, buserelin or triptorelin. no final conclusions are possible, whether 
 the suppression depends on the lhrh-analogues or on long-term effect of hcg. in all clinical studies, 
 luteal phase support was given according to the rules of the centre, in most cases progesterone, few 
 centres administered hcg or a combination of progesterone and hcg. a recommendation concerning 
 luteal support according to the reproductive medical centre&apos;s practice is mentioned in the spc</p></section><section><header n="">. evaluation of pregnancies and deliveries</header><p> - different art procedures were used in the studies. ivf/et and icsi are highly sophisticated procedures, which differ more or less from centre to centre; 
 ivf and icsi resulted in a similar pregnancy rate which was between 20 and 27% in cetrorelix 
 patients. the following table gives an overview on patients reaching the day of hcg, on patients with

 * including data until july 1998 few of the cycles were replacement cycles in which no cetrorelix treatment was given; in these cases a frozen embryo originating from a cycle during which stimulation with hmg and treatment with 
 cetrorelix or comparator drug took place, was transferred. 
 no firm conclusion can be drawn concerning the effectiveness of the cryopreservation programme. 
 however, the limited data on frozen-thawed cycles did not show a detrimental effect. 
 in phase ii studies, 59 pregnancies (25%) occurred after the first embryo transfer and additional</p><p>
 13 pregnancies were achieved after the first or second replacement of frozen and thawed embryos, 
 showing an overall pregnancy success rate of 31%. a total of 62 children were born. 
 in phase iii, the results of comparative studies in terms of pregnancies and deliveries suggest a higher 
 pregnancy (9% difference) and birth rate under treatment with lhrh-agonists. there is no statistical 
 interpretation for the different pregnancy rates.</p><p>
 miscarriages occurred in approximately 16% of the pregnancies in the phase ii and iii studies; 
 pregnancies achieved in replacement cycles had a higher abortion rate of more than 23%. four 
 abortions in the phase ii studies (three of them in replacement cycles) were performed due to 
 anatomical defects or chromosomal abnormalities. one anatomical defect and no chromosomal 
 abnormality were reported for cetrorelix in phase iii studies. ectopic pregnancies occurred in eight 
 cases of 219 pregnancies. 
 the comparison of the pregnancy rates in cetrorelix and buserelin/triptorelin treated patients with the 
 published data shows an exceptionally high pregnancy rate in triptorelin treated patients and rates for 
 cetrorelix, which are comparable with published literature. a benefit comparable to established 
 treatments can be assumed for cetrorelix.</p><p>
 summary on efficacy: two dosage regimens have been confirmed. cet 0.25 mg as multiple dose and cet 3 mg as single dose are effective in preventing lh surges. treatment with daily doses of 0.25 mg starting (studies 
 3010 and 3020) on day 5-6 of follicle stimulation or with a single dose of 3 mg (study 3030) on day</p><p>
 7 of follicle stimulation (in some cases followed by daily injection of 0.25 mg after 4 days) until 
 ovulation induction is recommended to prevent an lh surge. on either efficacy criteria, absence of lh 
 surge or day of hcg, cet was successful in the majority of patients.</p><p> 10/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 in clinical trials, cetrorelix was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however limited experience with recombinant fsh (61 patients undergoing cos/art in whom ovarian stimulation 
 with rec-fsh took place, 50% of whom received cetrorelix 3 mg single dose and another 50% of 
 whom cetrorelix multiple doses of 0.25 mg) suggested similar efficacy. this was addressed in the spc.</p><p>
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrorelix 3 mg during a repeated 
 ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore cetrorelix 3 mg should be used in repeated cycles only after 
 careful risk/benefit evaluation.</p></section><section><header>safety</header><p>the assessment of the safety of cetrorelix is based on the integrated summary including database from 878 female (during 881 stimulated cycles) and 196 male subjects exposed to cetrorelix, 125 females 
 exposed to reference treatments and 39 males exposed to placebo.</p><p>
 discontinuation - two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, one patient on cet had injection site reaction, and another on placebo had urticaria. 
 adverse events - the most common adverse events were injection site reactions (with an incidence of 9.4% following multiple injections of 0.25 mg cetrorelix), e.g. erythema, inflammatory reactions, 
 bruising, red plaque, itching, swelling and induration. the incidence of these events was higher in 
 females in phase i studies and in single dose studies. among female subjects, other common adverse 
 events observed in phase i studies were hot flushes, menstrual disorder, inter-menstrual bleeding and 
 pruritus; in addition to injection site reaction, those reported in cos/art (phase ii /iii) studies were 
 nausea, headache, hot flushes, menstrual and ovarian disorder. in male subjects with benign prostatic 
 hyperplasia (c2980) treated with cetrorelix, hot flushes and impotence were frequently reported; a 
 dose-related effect was noted. decreased libido was also reported by both male and female subjects. 
 the events reported as likely causally related were injection site reaction, nausea, pruritus and 
 headache. they are mentioned in the spc. 
 serious adverse events - eight serious adverse events were reported, 5 of them were ovarian hyperstimulation syndromes (ohss). the 3 other cases included one patient with urinary infection, 
 one patient with diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain, and one patient with a probable abdominal 
 infection and distension by gas. 
 in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, the serious events observed were cardiac distress (in subject 
 with a history of coronary artery disease), chest pain (assessed as non related), myocardial infarction 
 (in patient with a history of myocardial infarction 3 and half months after study drug medication) and 
 elective coronary revascularisation. the assessment of causal relationship revealed in all cases of 
 serious adverse events that a causal relationship was unlikely. 
 laboratory parameters - in phase i studies, urea increased by 12.7%, triglycerides by 42.8%, hdl by 14.4% and platelets by 9%. in cos/art studies in females, no significant differences were noted 
 between cet group and reference therapy – lhrh agonist. 
 in other studies and in males, cet group showed significant increase in sgot (14.5%), sgpt 
 (31.9%), bun (11%), hdl-cholesterol (9.4%) and cholesterol (5.7%). 
 limited data provided on bun showed no trend of rising bun following cetrorelix treatment. 
 although there was no serious safety concerns regarding liver function tests, a clear trend was noted 
 for late increase in liver enzymes and alkaline phoshatase. their association with cetrorelix cannot 
 entirely be ruled out. 
 repeated administration - there was limited data available on repeated administration, it is unknown whether the efficacy remains unchanged or whether sensitisation has been observed.</p><p>an appropriate 
 statement is included in the spc. 
 the safety data of cetrorelix 3 mg dose did not show a higher number of adverse events or more 
 serious adverse events except for injection site reactions, which were not considered as serious. 
 post-marketing experience - the evaluation of 3rd periodic safety update report signals a higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions at the time of first injection of cetrotide, which in some cases reached the 
 severity of an anaphylactic reaction. at present, occurrence of this kind of reaction cannot be excluded</p><p> 11/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 for subsequent injections. there is a relationship between previous allergic predisposition and hypersensitivity to cetrotide (all reported cases had a history of allergic predisposition). appropriate 
 information have been included in the spc and pl.</p></section><section><header>overall risk/benefit analysis</header><p>in therapeutic confirmatory studies, there was no group-comparative analysis planned initially for the target parameter to show non-inferiority of cetrorelix by the means of significance tests and</p><p>confidence 
 intervals (95%) for the appropriate parameters of all studies. subsequently, confidence intervals for the 
 demonstration of non-inferiority of cetrorelix in comparison to controls with a posteriori fixed margin 
 of 10% were used. however, itt analysis of the results of these studies in terms of their cetrorelix 
 arms, response rates of above 95% were achieved for the prevention of premature lh surges and for 
 reaching the hcg day. the response rates were confirmed by the uncontrolled study of multiple dosing 
 schedule. this may be regarded as evidence of efficacy.</p><p>
 in two studies with a sample size of 303 cetrorelix patients, a parallel comparison of cetrorelix vs 
 buserelin and vs triptorelin depot has been carried out, the results show a very similar effective 
 prevention of lh-surges for both treatments. in these comparative studies, the results in terms of 
 pregnancies and deliveries are lower for cetrorelix. with respect to some secondary efficacy endpoints, 
 the results show partly a tendency towards disfavouring cet in comparison to bus and tri. in phase 
 iii studies, centre effects were observed. furthermore, differences in prognostic factors at baseline 
 (history of pregnancies, male factors) to achieve pregnancy could also account for the inferior rate 
 following treatment with cetrorelix. 
 the comparison with published data, in terms of pregnancy rates, of cetrorelix and buserelin/triptorelin 
 treated patients shows an exceptionally high pregnancy rate in triptorelin treated patients, and the 
 cos/art procedure with cetrorelix results in pregnancy rates similar to those reported in literature for 
 art employing long protocols with lhrh-agonists.</p><p>
 injection site reaction and ovarian hyperstimulation syndromes were identified as main adverse events. 
 the injection site reaction would not alter the risk:benefit ratio of the product and ohss is not an 
 unexpected consequence of cos. headache and nausea were not considered serious in nature. 
 amongst laboratory abnormalities, increased levels of hdl-cholesterol, triglyceride, cholesterol, 
 bun, and abnormal liver function test were notable. patients with moderate to severe renal and hepatic 
 impairment are contraindicated in the spc. the number of investigated women (over 800 treated with 
 cetrorelix) is considered sufficient to detect an adverse reaction, which occur at a frequency of 0.5%. 
 overall, a benefit comparable to established treatments can be assumed for cetrorelix. a lh-surge can 
 be avoided by a daily dose of 0.25 mg starting from day 5-6 of hmg stimulation or a single dose of</p><p>
 3 mg given on the 7
 th day of follicular stimulation. if an lh surge has to be prevented for more than</p><p>4 days, additional injections of 0.25 mg daily are recommended starting 96 hours after 3 mg injection 
 until the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header n="5">5. conclusion</header><p>the quality of cetrotide 0.25 mg and 3 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, as demonstrated in the chemical, pharmaceutical documentation, is generally acceptable. additional data 
 was requested as defined in list of follow-up measures to be provided within an agreed timeframe. 
 the preclinical pharmacodynamic studies have adequately demonstrated that cetrorelix is a potent 
 antagonist of lhrh in various in vitro and animal models and binds competitively and with high 
 affinity to pituitary lhrh-receptors. findings in toxicity studies appear to be related to the 
 pharmacological actions of cetrorelix and thus secondary to suppression of hormone levels. overall, 
 the preclinical data do not raise special concerns for human safety. 
 the clinical efficacy confirmed that lhrh-antagonist, cetrorelix, effectively inhibits the release of lh 
 from the pituitary gland. it has not been investigated prospectively nor in a confirmative approach 
 whether the efficacy of cetrorelix is equivalent to the efficacy of lhrh-analogues. however, the 
 efficacy of cetrorelix is comparable with published literature for lhrh-analogues in terms of achieved 
 pregnancies. in a direct comparison of cetrorelix versus buserelin and versus triptorelin depot, its</p><p> 12/12 emea 2004</p><p>
 efficacy was very similar regarding prevention of lh surges, however, it was inferior in terms of pregnancy and delivery rates. 
 the majority of the reported adverse events were injection site reactions, e.g. reddening, itching, 
 swelling, induration. systemic adverse events were rare, e.g. nausea, pruritus and headache. the 
 administration of cetrorelix outside cos (i.e. in healthy women) results in symptoms of estrogen 
 deficiency, withdrawal bleeding and hot flushes, whereas these symptoms are not expected in cos 
 patients. laboratory parameters did not change in a relevant manner. there were no serious safety 
 concerns with regards to liver function tests, although a clear trend was noted for late increase in liver 
 enzymes and alkaline phosphatase. the spc includes appropriate contraindications regarding 
 moderate to severe renal and hepatic impairments. 
 taking into consideration the data provided, the overall safety issues and the benefit/risk ratio, 
 cetrorelix is considered to be a safe and effective alternative for the prevention of premature ovulation 
 in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation. the cpmp considered the benefit to risk 
 assessment positive and recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for all strengths and 
 presentations of this medicinal product. the product is authorised for the indication &apos;prevention of 
 premature ovulation in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by oocyte pick-
 up and assisted reproductive techniques.</p></section><section><header>abbreviations:</header><p>cos/art: controlled ovarian stimulation/assisted reproduction technique lh: luteinising hormone
