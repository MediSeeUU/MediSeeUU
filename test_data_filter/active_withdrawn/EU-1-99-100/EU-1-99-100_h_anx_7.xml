 4.1
 therapeutic indications</header><p>prevention of premature ovulation in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followedby oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.
 in clinical trials cetrotide 0.25 mg was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however,
 limited experience with recombinant fsh suggested similar efficacy.</p></section><section><header>4.2posology and method of administration</header><p>cetrotide 0.25 mg should only be prescribed by a specialist experienced in this field.cetrotide 0.25 mg is for subcutaneous injection into the lower abdominal wall.
 the first administration of cetrotide should be performed under the supervision of a physician and
 under conditions where treatment of possible pseudo-allergic reactions is immediately available.</p><p>the
 following injections may be self-administered as long as the patient is made aware of the signs and
 symptoms that may indicate hypersensitivity, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for
 immediate medical intervention.
 the contents of 1 vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in
 the morning or in the evening. following the first administration, it is advised that the patient be kept
 under medical supervision for 30 minutes to ensure there is no allergic/pseudo-allergic reaction to the
 injection.</p><p>facilities for the treatment of such reactions should be immediately available.
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should commence on day 5 or 6 of
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period
 including the day of ovulation induction.
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should commence on day 5 of
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until
 the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.

 � pregnancy and lactation.� postmenopausal women.� patients with moderate and severe renal and hepatic impairment.</p></section><section><header>4.4special warnings and special precautions for use</header><p>special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions orknown history of allergic predisposition.</p><p>treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with
 severe allergic conditions.
 during or following ovarian stimulation an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event
 must be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins.
 an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous
 electrolytes/colloids and heparin therapy.
 luteal phase support should be given according to the reproductive medical centre´s practice.
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a repeated
 ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore cetrotide 0.25 mg should be used in repeated cycles only
 after a careful risk/benefit evaluation.</p></section><section><header>4.5interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</header><p>in vitro investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medications that are metabolisedby cytochrome p450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. however, the possibility of
 interactions with commonly used medicinal products cannot entirely be excluded.</p></section><section><header>4.6pregnancy and lactation</header><p>cetrotide 0.25 mg is not intended to be used during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3 “contra-indications“).
 studies in animals have indicated that cetrorelix exerts a dose related influence on fertility,
 reproductive performance and pregnancy. no teratogenic effects occurred when the drug was
 administered during the sensitive phase of gestation.</p></section><section><header>4.7effects on ability to drive and use machines</header><p>due to its pharmacological profile cetrorelix is unlikely to impair the patient’s ability to drive or tooperate machinery.

 following multiple injections of 0.25 mg cetrorelix.</p><p>rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions including
 pseudo-allergic/anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported.
 occasionally nausea and headache have been reported.
 occasionally an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur which is an intrinsic risk of the
 stimulation procedure (see section 4.4 “special warnings and precautions for use”).</p></section><section><header>4.9overdose</header><p>overdosage in humans may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associatedwith acute toxic effects.
 in acute toxicity studies in rodents non-specific toxic symptoms were observed after intraperitoneal
 administration of cetrorelix doses more than 200 times higher than the pharmacologically effective
 dose after subcutaneous administration.</p></section><section><header>5.pharmacological properties
 5.1
 pharmacodynamic properties</header><p>pharmacotherapeutic group: lhrh-antagonist, atc code: h01cc02.cetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (lhrh) antagonist. lhrh binds to membrane
 receptors on pituitary cells. cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous lhrh to these
 receptors. due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (lh and
 fsh).
 cetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland. the onset
 of suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial
 stimulatory effect.
 in females, cetrorelix delays the lh surge and consequently ovulation. in women undergoing ovarian
 stimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. following a single dose of 3 mg of
 cetrorelix a duration of action of at least 4 days has been evaluated. on day 4 the suppression was
 approximately 70%. at a dose of 0.25 mg per injection repeated injections every 24 hours will
 maintain the effect of cetrorelix.
 in animals as well as in humans, the antagonistic hormonal effects of cetrorelix were fully reversible
 after termination of treatment.</p></section><section><header>5.2pharmacokinetic properties</header><p>the absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix after subcutaneous administration is about 85%.the total plasma clearance and the renal clearance are 1.2 ml x min
 -1 x kg-1 and 0.1 ml x min-1 x kg-1 ,respectively. the volume of distribution (v
 d,area) is 1.1 l x kg-1. the mean terminal half-lives followingintravenous and subcutaneous administration are about 12 h and 30 h, respectively, demonstrating the
 effect of absorption processes at the injection site. the subcutaneous administration of single doses
 (0.25 mg to 3 mg cetrorelix) and also daily dosing over 14 days show linear kinetics.</p></section><section><header>5.3preclinical safety data</header><p>5no target organ toxicity could be observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in ratsand dogs following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix. no signs of drug-related local
 irritation or incompatibility were noted in dogs after intravenous, intra-arterial and paravenous
 injection when cetrorelix was administered in doses clearly above the intended clinical use in man.
 cetrorelix showed no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in gene and chromosome mutation assays.</p></section><section><header>6.pharmaceutical particulars
