 additionally, for each vial the packs contain</p><p>
 • one pre-filled syringe with solvent (water for injections) for parenteral use for dissolving the powder in the vial

 (lh), which induces ovulation during the menstrual cycle. cetrotide 0.25 mg inhibits premature 
 ovulation which is undesirable during hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation as only mature 
 egg cells are suitable for fertilisation.</p></section><section><header>therapeutic indications why use cetrotide 0.25 mg?</header><p>cetrotide 0.25 mg is used to prevent premature ovulation during a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.</p><p>
 in clinical trials cetrotide 0.25 mg was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), 
 however, limited experience with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested 
 similar efficacy. hmg and fsh are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header>contra-indications when should you not use cetrotide 0.25 mg?</header><p>do not use cetrotide 0.25 mg if you</p><p>
 • are allergic to cetrorelix acetate, mannitol or exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similar to cetrotide 0.25 mg) 
 • are pregnant or breast-feeding • have already reached your menopause • have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>precautions for use what precautions have to be taken?</header><p>during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones 
 promoting egg maturation). for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient 
 information leaflet of the gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you.</p><p> 
 luteal phase support (a measure to support the onset of pregnancy) should be given according to 
 the reproductive medical centre´s practice. 
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a 
 repeated ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore you should use cetrotide 0.25 mg in repeated

 products cannot entirely be excluded.</p></section><section><header>instructions for proper use how much of cetrotide 0.25 mg should you use and how often should you use it?</header><p>the following statements apply to cetrotide 0.25 mg unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide 0.25 
 mg.</p><p>
 the contents of one vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, 
 either in the morning or in the evening.</p><p>
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 or 6 of 
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with 
 urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin 
 treatment period including the day of ovulation induction.</p><p>
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 of 
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with 
 urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin 
 treatment period until the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>how should you use cetrotide 0.25 mg?</header><p>you may self-administer cetrotide 0.25 mg after appropriate instruction from your doctor.</p><p>
 cetrotide 0.25 mg is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around 
 the navel. to minimise local irritation, please select a different injection site each day.</p><p>
 dissolve cetrotide 0.25 mg powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do 
 not use a cetrotide 0.25 mg solution if it contains particles or if it is not clear.</p><p>
 before you administer cetrotide 0.25 mg yourself, please read the following instructions 
 carefully:</p><p>
 1. 
 wash your hands. it is important that your hands and all items you use are as clean as 
 possible.</p><p>-- 52. lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one 
 injection needle with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two 
 alcohol swabs).</p><p>
 3. flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper 
 with an alcohol swab.</p><p>
 4. take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-
 filled syringe and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of 
 the needle.</p><p>
 5. push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into 
 the vial by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.</p><p>
 6. leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and 
 without residue. avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.</p><p>
 7. draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert 
 the vial, pull back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if 
 you look from the side through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the 
 needle and the liquid. it is important to withdraw the entire contents of the vial.</p><p>
 8. detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle 
 with the grey mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the 
 cover of the needle.</p><p>
 9. invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not 
 touch the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.</p><p>
 10. choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take 
 the second alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one 
 hand. gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the 
 other hand.</p><p>
 11. hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at 
 an angle of about 45 degree.</p><p>
 12. once the needle has been inserted completely, release your grasp of the skin.</p><p>
 13. pull back gently the plunger of the syringe. if blood appears continue as described in step 
 14. if no blood appears, inject the solution slowly by pushing the plunger gently forward. after all of the solution is injected, withdraw the needle slowly, applying gentle pressure 
 with the alcohol swab on the skin where the needle was inserted. withdraw the needle at 
 the same angle as it was inserted.</p><p>
 14. if blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently apply pressure to the 
 injection site. do not use this solution but empty the syringe in a sink. start again with step 
 1.</p><p>
 15. 
 use the syringe and needles only once. dispose of the syringe and needles immediately 
 after use (put the covers on the needles to avoid injury).</p></section><section><header>special advice what do you do if you have used too much of cetrotide 0.25 mg?</header><p> -- 6overdosage of cetrotide 0.25 mg may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated with acute toxic effects. therefore, in case of overdosage no specific measures are 
 required.</p></section><section><header>what to do if you miss a dose?</header><p>if you missed to administer cetrotide 0.25 mg on one day, please contact your doctor immediately and ask for advice.</p><p>
 ideally cetrotide 0.25 mg should be administered at 24 hours intervals. but if you missed to 
 administer cetrotide 0.25 mg at the right time it is no problem to administer this dose at a 
 different time of the same day.</p></section><section><header>side effects what undesirable effects may cetrotide 0.25 mg cause?</header><p>mild and transient reactions may occur at the injection site like reddening, itching, and swelling.</p><p>
 occasionally systemic side effects, like nausea and headache have been reported. in addition, a 
 single case of</p><p>pruritus has been reported during treatment with cetrorelix..</p><p>
 a severe hypersensitivity reaction, associated with cough, rash and hypotension, was observed in 
 one patient after 7 months of treatment of ovarian cancer with cetrorelix (10 mg/day). the patient 
 recovered completely within 20 minutes. a causal relationship could not be excluded.</p><p>
 occasionally, stimulation of ovaries with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg maturation) 
 may lead to a so-called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). symptoms like abdominal 
 pain, tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and breathing difficulties may indicate an ohss. 
 please inform your doctor immediately, if you feel such symptoms.</p><p>
