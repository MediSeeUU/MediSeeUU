 � one pre-filled syringe with solvent (water for injections) for parenteral use for dissolving thepowder in the vial
 � one injection needle with a yellow mark for injecting the water into the vial and withdrawing thesolution from the vial
 � one injection needle with a grey mark for injecting the solution� two alcohol swabs for cleaning purposes.cetrotide 0.25 mg inhibits the effects of a natural hormone, called luteinising hormone releasing
 hormone (lhrh). lhrh regulates the secretion of another hormone, called luteinising hormone
 (lh), which induces ovulation during the menstrual cycle. cetrotide 0.25 mg inhibits premature
 ovulation which is undesirable during hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation as only mature egg
 cells are suitable for fertilisation.
 4</p></section><section><header>therapeutic indications</header><p>cetrotide 0.25 mg is used to prevent premature ovulation during a controlled ovarian stimulation,followed by oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.
 in clinical trials cetrotide 0.25 mg was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg), however,
 limited experience with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) suggested similar efficacy.
 hmg and fsh are hormones promoting egg maturation.</p></section><section><header>2.before you use cetrotide
   do not use cetrotide:</header><p>� if you are allergic to cetrorelix acetate, mannitol or exogenous peptide hormones (medicines similarto cetrotide 0.25 mg).
 � if you are pregnant or breast-feeding� if you have already reached your menopause� if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease.</p></section><section><header>take special care with cetrotide:</header><p>special care should be taken in women with an active allergic condition or a known history of allergy.since treatment with cetrotide is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions it is important
 that you inform your doctor of any allergies.
 during or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can
 occur. this event is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg
 maturation). for symptoms and suitable measures please refer to the patient information leaflet of the
 gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you.
 luteal phase support (a measure to support the onset of pregnancy) should be given according to the
 reproductive medical centre´s practice.
 there is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrotide 0.25 mg during a repeated
 ovarian stimulation procedure. therefore you should use cetrotide 0.25 mg in repeated cycles only
 after a careful risk/benefit evaluation by your doctor.</p></section><section><header>pregnancy and breast-feeding:</header><p>you should not use cetrotide 0.25 mg if you are already pregnant, or suspect that you might bepregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.</p></section><section><header>driving and using machines:</header><p>as far as it is known, cetrotide 0.25 mg does not impair your ability to drive or to operate machinery.</p></section><section><header>using other medicines:</header><p>please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines,even those not prescribed.</p><p>experimental investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medications that are
 metabolised in the liver. however, the possibility of interactions with commonly used medicinal
 products cannot entirely be excluded.</p><p> 5</p></section><section><header>3.how to use cetrotide
  how much cetrotide should you use and how often should you use it?</header><p>the following statements apply to cetrotide 0.25 mg unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.please observe these instructions for use, otherwise you will not fully benefit from cetrotide 0.25 mg.
 the contents of one vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals,
 either in the morning or in the evening.
 administration in the morning: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 or 6 of
 ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to 120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period
 including the day of ovulation induction.
 administration in the evening: treatment with cetrotide 0.25 mg should begin on day 5 of ovarian
 stimulation (approximately 96 to 108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or
 recombinant gonadotropins and is to be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until
 the evening prior to the day of ovulation induction.</p></section><section><header>how should cetrotide be administered?</header><p>the first injection of cetrotide should be supervised by your doctor.</p><p>you can carry out the followinginjections yourself as long as you have been made aware by your doctor of the symptoms that may
 indicate allergy, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate treatment.
 cetrotide 0.25 mg is for injection under the skin of the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the
 navel. to minimise local irritation, please select a different injection site each day.
 dissolve cetrotide 0.25 mg powder only with the water contained in the pre-filled syringe. do not use
 a cetrotide 0.25 mg solution if it contains particles or if it is not clear.</p></section><section><header>before you administer cetrotide yourself, please read the following instructions carefully:</header><p>1.wash your hands. it is important that your hands and all items you use are as clean as possible.
 2.
 lay out on a clean surface everything you need (one vial, one pre-filled syringe, one injection
 needle with a yellow mark, one injection needle with a grey mark and two alcohol swabs).
 3.
 flip off the plastic cover of the vial. wipe the aluminium ring and the rubber stopper with an
 alcohol swab.
 4.
 take the injection needle with the yellow mark and remove the wrapping. take the pre-filled
 syringe and remove the cover. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the needle.
 5.
 push the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. inject the water into the vial
 by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe.
 6.
 leave the syringe on the vial. gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without
 residue. avoid forming bubbles during dissolution.
 7.
 draw the whole contents of the vial into the syringe. if solution is left in the vial, invert the vial,
 pull back the needle until the opening of the needle is just inside the stopper. if you look from
 the side through the gap in the stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the
 liquid. it is important to withdraw the entire contents of the vial.
 68.detach the syringe from the needle and lay down the syringe. take the injection needle with the
 grey mark and remove its wrapping. put the needle on the syringe and remove the cover of the
 needle.
 9.
 invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. do not touch
 the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface.
 10.
 choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. take the
 second alcohol swab and clean the skin at the injection site. hold the syringe in one hand.
 gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection and hold firmly with the other hand.
 11.
 hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil, insert the needle completely into the skin at an
 angle of about 45 degree.
 12.
 once the needle has been inserted completely, release your grasp of the skin.
 13.
 pull back gently the plunger of the syringe. if blood appears continue as described in step 14. if
 no blood appears, inject the solution slowly by pushing the plunger gently forward. after all of
 the solution is injected, withdraw the needle slowly, applying gentle pressure with the alcohol
 swab on the skin where the needle was inserted. withdraw the needle at the same angle as it was
 inserted.
 14.
 if blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently apply pressure to the injection
 site. do not use this solution but empty the syringe in a sink. start again with step 1.
 15.
 use the syringe and needles only once. dispose of the syringe and needles immediately after
 use (put the covers on the needles to avoid injury).</p></section><section><header>if you use more cetrotide than you should:</header><p>overdosage of cetrotide 0.25 mg may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to beassociated with acute toxic effects. therefore, in case of overdosage no specific measures are required.</p></section><section><header>if you forget to take cetrotide:</header><p>if you forgot to take cetrotide 0.25 mg on one day, please contact your doctor immediately and ask foradvice.
 ideally cetrotide 0.25 mg should be administered at 24 hours intervals. but if you missed to
 administer cetrotide 0.25 mg at the right time it is no problem to administer this dose at a different
 time of the same day.</p></section><section><header>4.possible side effects</header><p>like all medicines, cetrotide can have side effects. mild and transient reactions may occur at the injection site like reddening, itching, and swelling.
 rare cases of severe generalised allergic reactions have also been reported.
 occasionally systemic side effects, like nausea and headache have been reported. in addition, a single
 case of pruritus has been reported during treatment with cetrorelix.
 7occasionally, stimulation of ovaries with gonadotropins (hormones promoting egg maturation) maylead to a so-called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). symptoms like abdominal pain,
 tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and breathing difficulties may indicate an ohss. please inform
 your doctor immediately, if you feel such symptoms.
 if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</p></section><section><header>5.storing cetrotide</header><p>keep out of the reach and sight of children.</p><p>do not store above 25
