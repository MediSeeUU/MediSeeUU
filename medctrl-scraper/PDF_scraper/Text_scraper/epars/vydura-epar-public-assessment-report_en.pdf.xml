disease or condition migraine is a serious, chronic, disabling neurological disease characterised by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully treated. people with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 2.1.2.

</section>
<section>

epidemiology  migraine is a highly prevalent disease, occurring in 11% to 12% of people in europe, with higher rates among women (16% to 18%) than men (6% to 7%) (goadsby et al. 2002). the disease is particularly common among individuals between the ages of 25 and 55 years. migraine has been reported to be the second highest cause of years lived with disability, interfering significantly with occupational, educational, household, family, and social responsibilities (gbd 2017). because of intense pain and other burdensome symptoms including photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting (linde and dahlöf 2004; ford et al. 2017), patients with migraine report extensive limitations in life activities (leonardi et al. 2010). people with migraine have higher lifetime rates of comorbid depression, anxiety, panic disorder, sleep disturbances, chronic pain syndromes, and suicide attempts (buse et al. 2009; mrf 2017). they are also at higher risk for ischaemic stroke and other cardiovascular (cv) diseases (blumenfeld et al. 2011; sacco and kurth 2014). 2.1.3.

aetiology and pathogenesis it is currently thought that migraine has a neurologic aetiology (goadsby et al. 2002; goadsby 2009; amin et al. 2013). the brains of patients with migraine are characterised by a generalised neuronal hyperexcitability, evidenced by increased response to visual, sensory, auditory, and nociceptive stimuli, and migraine attacks involve release of neurotransmitters and activation of pain pathways, including the trigeminal nerve (xavier et al. 2017; dodick 2018). migraine pain appears to involve nociceptive neurons in the dura mater being stimulated and releasing vasoactive neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp). the trigeminal nerve pathway transmits nociception from the meninges via intermediate pathways to the cortex.  the cgrp is a neuropeptide that modulates nociceptive signalling and causes vasodilation that has been associated with migraine pathophysiology. 2.1.4.

clinical presentation, diagnosis  standard diagnostic criteria are based the international classification of headache disorders (ichd-3 beta version). they have been developed by the headache classification committee of the international headache society (ihs). as per inclusion criteria in phase 2/3 trials, the target population, for which treatment with rimegepant (rgp) is claimed, was defined along historical numbers of migraine attacks, resp. migraine days (mds). while prevention study 305 was ongoing, amendments to the protocol were implemented widening inclusion criteria as to also include subjects with up to 18 headache days per month. thereby, subjects with cm would potentially be eligible for study participation. definite ichd-3 codes like e.g. 1.1 migraine without aura, 1.2.1 migraine with typical aura, 1.3 chronic migraine, or

management according to current treatment guidelines, unspecific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) like acetylic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol etc. rank among first-line therapies, however, are typically used for less severe migraine attacks. the portion of patients being pain-free 2 hours post-dose is established as the most meaningful measure for efficacy of current migraine therapies. the rates of patients 2-hours pain-free that can be achieved with unspecific nsaids in meta-analyses are in the range of 20-25% (ferrari et al. 2002; cameron et al. 2015). major progress in more specific treatment of acute migraine symptoms was achieved with the advent of the triptans in the nineties. triptans target 5-ht1b and 5-ht1d receptors and their mechanism is thought to involve cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release (rizatriptan summary of product characteristics (smpc)). as the gold standard for acute treatment of migraine, they represent 28% to 36% of prescribed acute migraine medications (mafi et al. 2015; molina et al. 2018). however, triptans are not efficacious for all patients: rates of pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose with triptans in a meta-analysis are in the range of 20% to 40% (ferrari et al. 2002). furthermore, efficacy and tolerability vary, both between agents (7 triptans approved so far), and from patient to patient, with about 30-40% of patients not responding adequately to triptan therapy (viana m et al. 2013). not all patients with migraine tolerate triptans. among those discontinuing triptan therapy, side effects were reported as the reason in 29% of patients (wells et al. 2014). also, triptans are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease (cad), peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or uncontrolled hypertension (dodick et al. 2004; relpax smpc). a large proportion of patients with migraine have cv risk factors, a history of cv events, conditions, or procedures, or a high risk of cv disease (lipton et al. 2017). acute treatment of migraine attacks is to be differentiated from prophylactic treatment of migraine, for which most recently several human / humanised antibodies, selectively binding to the cgrp ligand or its receptor, have been approved (erenumab [aimovig], fremanezumab [ajovy], galcanezumab [emgality], eptinezumab [vyepti, us]. although forming the mainstay of current acute migraine therapy, it is concluded that around 30% of patients fail to respond to a particular triptan (dodick dw 2005). the reasons therefore are not fully understood. on top of considerable inter- and intra-individual attack variability, a large number of other factors modifying responsiveness have been identified, like e.g. concomitant use of preventive medication, moh, inadequate dosing, the time point of medication intake relative to the onset of the attack, incomplete absorption due to concomitant gastric stasis or vomiting, presence resp. absence of aura symptoms etc. (viana m 2013). furthermore, the use of the triptans is limited with regard to their cv risk profile. as evidenced for the leading substance (sumatriptan), triptans are contraindicated in patients with a previous cerebrovascular accident (cva), transient ischemic attack (tia), moderately severe or severe hypertension, or untreated mild hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, established cad, including ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or prinzmetal’s angina.

about the product rimegepant (bhv-3000; formerly bms-927711) is presented as a selective, high-affinity, orally administered, small molecule cgrp receptor antagonist.  calcitonin gene-related peptide is an endogenous 37 amino acid peptide contained within pain-signalling nociceptive afferents, and is thought to play a causal role in migraine (edvinsson 2018, moreno-ajona 2020). multiple lines of clinical evidence point to a role for cgrp in migraine pathophysiology: 1) serum levels of cgrp are elevated during migraine; 2) treatment with anti-migraine drugs returns cgrp levels to normal coincident with pain relief; and 3) intravenous (iv) cgrp infusion produces lasting pain in non-migraineurs and migraineurs. treatment with a cgrp receptor antagonist is thought to relieve migraine by: 1) blocking cgrp-induced neurogenic vasodilation (returning dilated intracranial arteries to normal); 2) halting the cascade of cgrp-induced neurogenic inflammation (which leads to peripheral and central sensitisation); and/or 3) inhibiting the central relay of pain signals from the trigeminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus (durham 2004). the indication proposed for vydura does not align with standard wordings approved for the treatment of migraine so far. rimegepant is the first substance to claim efficacy both for acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine. available, orally administered preventive migraine medications (topiramate, ß-blockers) are not effective in acute migraine and their mode of action in migraine prevention is hypothetical.  2.3.

pharmacology rimegepant is a high affinity (ki = 32.9 pm) oral small molecule antagonist at the human cgrp receptor that is being developed for the treatment of migraine. cgrp is an endogenous 37 amino acid peptide contained within pain signaling nociceptive afferents, and is thought to play a causal role in migraine. rimegepant is a cgrp receptor antagonist at the hcgrp receptor with high affinity binding (ki = 32.9 pm) and functional (kb = 117.8 pm) activity at the hcgrp receptor. rimegepant shows rapid onset kinetics and delayed off-rate for binding to the hcgrp receptor, with a 5x tendency to remain bound versus unbound.  regarding receptor selectivity, rimegepant demonstrates 65- to &gt; 300,000-fold selectivity for the hcgrp receptor over other members of the calcitonin receptor family; binding affinity for amylin 1 was the most similar, with an ic50 of 2.28 nm (compared to 54.3 pm for cgrp). available data indicate that rimegepant does not have a consequential effect in diabetic patients. rimegepant did not significantly alter ligand binding or functional activity against 30 of the 32 unique pharmacological targets at maximum concentrations between 10 and 150 µm, depending on the individual assay. median inhibition concentration (ic50) or half maximal effective concentration  (ec50) values were ≥10 µm, except for pde4 (ec50 of 5.8 µm) and the norepinephrine transporter (net) showing an ic50 of 9.5 um. as rimegepant does not cross the blood brain barrier, significant interaction

pharmacokinetics various in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterise the pk and metabolism of rimegepant in the non-clinical setting. further data on toxicokinetics (tk) were obtained within the different studies conducted to investigate the toxicology of rimegepant. single dose pk studies were performed in male rats, dogs and monkeys. absolute oral bioavailability of rimegepant given as a solution in rats and monkeys was 45% and 67% respectively. when rimegepant was dosed as a suspension in monkeys, bioavailability was 48%. after oral administration, time to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) was 1.7 to 3.3 hours in rats and monkeys, respectively. rimegepant has a significant ph-effect in dogs and oral dosing of the hemisulfate salt reduces the impact of higher gastric ph. accordingly, all clinical phase iii studies were conducted with the hemisulfate formulation.  rimegepant does not readily distribute into red blood cells, is moderately bound to plasma proteins and is highly distributed into tissues. brain distribution was studied as a part of a 2-week exploratory study in male and female rats. brain-to-plasma concentration ratio 24 hours after the last dose was 0.02 to 0.08 in all groups, except for low dose males. the same brain exposure was observed, but 50% lower plasma exposure resulting in brain-to-plasma ratios below 0.19.  in humans and different animal species investigated, unchanged rimegepant was the most prominent circulating component in plasma. rimegepant was metabolised to a wide variety of different metabolites. no major metabolite (&gt;10%) was detected in human plasma as well as in plasma of animal species. all metabolites detected in humans were also observed in at least one animal species. based on data from animals and humans, rimegepant undergoes multiple pathways of metabolism: carbamoylation followed by glucuronidation, hydrolysis and oxidative metabolism. faecal excretion was the major elimination pathway for [14c]-rimegepant in humans and animals (mice, rats, monkeys).  whether rimegepant transfers into breast milk was not investigated in animal studies. however, a clinical study was performed to evaluate rimegepant concentrations in plasma and breast-milk of breast-feeding women. when assessed in vitro, the metabolism of rimegepant was primarily mediated via cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by cyp2c9. no turnover was detected with the cyp2c9 variant forms, cyp2c9*2 and

toxicology a full nonclinical toxicology testing was performed in mice (carcinogenicity), rats (single- and repeat-dose toxicity, in vivo genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity), rabbits (reproductive and developmental toxicity) and monkeys (single- and repeat-dose toxicity). phototoxicity testing was performed in vitro and qualification of the impurity profile of rimegepant was investigated in a 3-month chronic toxicity study in rats. the impurity profiles of the batches used in the non-clinical studies tested was comparable to that used in clinic. no stand-alone local tolerance studies were performed with rimegepant because the intended therapeutic route (oral) was assessed in the repeat-dose general toxicity studies. pivotal studies were conducted in compliance with glp regulations and according to the ich guidelines. all studies used rimegepant as the free base with the exception of the 6- and 9-repeat toxicity studies (rat, monkey), segment i and iii reproductive/developmental (rat), juvenile toxicity (rat), and carcinogenicity studies (mouse, rat) that used rimegepant sulfate, which is the form of this compound for human use. all studies used the oral application, the intended clinical route of administration of rimegepant. tk data for rimegepant was determined in all studies. repeat dose toxicity repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and monkeys. in the two week exploratory studies, rimegepant exposures of males and females were similar. however, in longer term studies (3 month and 6 month) exposures in females were around 2-times higher than in males. no accumulation of rimegepant was observed as well as a dose-proportional increase in cmax and auc in all rat studies.

genotoxicity genotoxicity testing of rimegepant was carried out in two in vitro (bacterial and mammalian mutation assay, chromosome aberration assay) and an in vivo (rat micronucleus tests) study in compliance with glp. rimegepant was negative in in vitro ames tests, chromosome aberration assays in cho cells and in an oral in vivo micronucleus test performed in the rat. carcinogenicity rimegepant was not carcinogenic in a short-term study in hemizygous tg.rash2 mice and a 2 year lifespan study in crl:cd(sd) rats. despite the even lower binding affinity (ki) for the cgrp receptors compared to humans (≥ 1300 x) the exposures (cmax unbound) in rodents exceeded the ki 269 x in mice (ki 0.104 µm) respectively 14 x in rats (ki 0.209 µm) at the noael (300 and 45 mg/kg) for carcinogenicity. therefore, both the on-target and off-target effects of rimegepant were appropriately evaluated in the carcinogenicity studies. the calculated safety margins based on auc compared to the clinical exposure (75 mg/d) were 379x in mice and 45x in rats. additionally, the applicant submitted a comprehensive weight of evidence risk assessment for carcinogenicity of rimegepant based on literature and study data. rimegepant has generally minimal off-target binding, was negative for genetic toxicity, showed no proliferative (hypertrophic/hyperplastic) or preneoplastic/neoplastic changes or persistent tissue injury or chronic inflammation in repeat dose toxicity studies up to the highest doses tested independent of species and study duration. further, no hormonal perturbation, histopathological changes in endocrine or reproductive organs or effects on the immune system were observed in pivotal non-clinical studies. therefore, it can be assumed that rimegepant has no carcinogenic potential under the conditions of the studies. reproductive and juvenile toxicity

ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment at present the environmental risk assessment (era) cannot be finalised. a post-authorisation measure need to be addressed. the applicant has submitted the report detailing the experimental determination of the log kow of rimegepant sulfate in accordance with oecd test guidelines (determined using the shake flask method).  the estimated log (p) kow value for rimegepant sulfate has been experimentally determined to be 0.806. therefore, there is no pbt risk. the applicant used a default fpen value resulting in a pecsurfacewater of 0.375 µg/l that clearly exceeds the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. therefore, a phase ii risk assessment is deemed necessary.

population pharmacokinetics a ppk model has been developed with data of eight studies in healthy volunteers including subjects with different degrees of renal and hepatic impairment and elderly people. a two-compartment disposition model for rimegepant with 4 transit compartments of absorption into the central compartment was identified to best describe the time course of the plasma concentration-time course of rimegepant. the following statistically significant covariates were identified in the final model: allometric weight scaling on clearance and volume parameters, fluconazole and itraconazole use (moderate and strong cyp3a4 inhibitor, respectively), and severe/moderate hepatic impairment on elimination clearance, fed status, itraconazole use, capsule formulation, and odt on transit absorption rate constant (ktr), fed status on bioavailability. impacts on exposure by the statistically significant parameters were not clinically relevant with the exception of strong cyp3a inhibitors. smpc sections 4.4 and 4.5 specify that rimegepant is not recommended for concomitant use with strong inhibitors of cyp3a4.  2.6.3.

early data obtained from literature, animal testing, and modelling to develop a relationship between rgp plasma levels and levels of cgrp signalling inhibition required for clinical anti-migraine effect acute treatment of migraine attacks – dose ranging study phase 2b dose ranging study cn170003 was conducted from oct-2011 to may-2012 at 41 sites in the us. cn170003 was a response-adaptive, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, outpatient evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and dose-response of bms-927711, as compared to placebo, in the treatment of moderate to severe migraine headache. subjects were randomised to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg active control, or 1 of 6 doses of bms-927711: 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg. the study was divided into 3 phases: a screening/baseline phase (3-28 days), an acute treatment phase (up to 45 days during which time subjects treated 1 migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity), followed by an eot visit within 7 days of administration of study medication. subjects were included if presenting with at least a 1-year history of migraines (with or without aura), age of onset prior to 50 years, migraine attacks (on average) lasting about 4 - 72 hours if untreated, and not more than 8 attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last 3 months. eligible subjects had to report less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3 months prior to the screening visit and maintained this requirement during the screening period. prophylactic migraine medication was permitted while on study therapy provided the dose was stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry. a total of 1,026 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 86.3% (885) of these were randomised to treatment. of the 885 randomised subjects, 812 (79.1%) completed the study.  efficacy was measured as the portion of subjects achieving pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose, i.e. headache pain intensity reported as “no pain” using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain). additionally, total migraine freedom was measured (composite endpoint consisting of headache pain freedom coupled with no symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at 2 hours post-dose).

sumatriptan and several dose levels of bms-927711 had a significantly greater percentage of subjects with sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours post-dose as compared with placebo: 26.0% for sumatriptan, 28.2% for 150 mg, 27.9% for 75 mg, 26.1% for 300 mg, 20.7% for the 600 mg, and 16.4% for the 25 mg dose groups. pharmacodynamic interaction with sumatriptan on blood pressure the primary objective of study 114 (oct-2018 to nov-2018) was to evaluate the effect of rimegepant on resting bp when administered concomitantly with sumatriptan in healthy subjects. as a secondary objective, the pk of sumatriptan when administered alone and concomitantly with rimegepant in healthy subjects were assessed. sumatriptan succinate injection was administered as two subcutaneous (sc injections of 6 mg/0.5 ml separated by approximately 1 hour for a total dose of 12 mg on days 1 and 5. rimegepant 75 mg (tablet) or placebo was administered once daily for 4 consecutive days from day 2 to day 5. since sumatriptan was administered as a sc injection, only rimegepant and placebo were administered in a double-blinded fashion. subjects were randomly assigned to receive either rimegepant or matching placebo in a 6 to 1 ratio. the safety and tolerability of rimegepant, sumatriptan, and placebo were evaluated through the assessment of adverse events (aes), clinical laboratory parameters (biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg), vital signs, sheehan suicidality tracking scale (s-sts, and physical examination. automated blood pressure analyses following a manual recording at pre-dose, a total of 37 automated bp recordings were performed over a 15-hour period at pre-determined time points just after the first sumatriptan injection on day 1 and rimegepant administration on days 4 and 5 as follows: •

no relevant differences were observed for vital signs measurements over time. no significant difference was detected in time weighted average bp measures of mean arterial pressure, systolic (sbp) or diastolic pressures (dbp) between co-administration of rimegepant and sumatriptan as compared to sumatriptan administration alone. tqtc study study 180099 (aug 2018 to oct 2018) was a randomised, partially double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled, 4-way crossover, single-centre study of oral rimegepant at therapeutic (75 mg) and supratherapeutic (300 mg) doses, administered as single doses, in healthy adults. moxifloxacin (a single 400-mg oral dose) was used as a positive control. the following figure illustrates the time course of qtcf changes from baseline in the four treatment groups.

mean change-from-baseline qtcf (δqtcf) on rimegepant followed closely the placebo pattern and did not suggest an effect on cardiac repolarisation. mean δqtcf values on rimegepant were negative at all post-dose time points, with the exception a δqtcf value of 0.2 msec at 5 hours post-dose in subjects dosed with 300 mg rimegepant. as a result, mean placebo-corrected δqtcf (δδqtcf) was also very small and ranged from -1.4 msec at 2 hours post-dose to 2.0 msec at 3.5 hours post-dose, both after dosing with 75 mg rimegepant and δδqtcf was within ± 1.6 msec upon treatment with 300 mg rimegepant. after dosing with moxifloxacin, a clear increase of mean δδqtcf was observed with a peak value of 14.1 msec (90% ci: 12.10 to 16.20) at 3.5 hours post-dose. there were no treatment-emergent t-wave or u-wave morphology changes. relationship between plasma concentration and effect targeted ≥ 90% inhibition of cgrp-signalling primate cgrp pd and human pk identified rimegepant 75 mg as the human dose where ≥ 90% inhibition of cgrp-signalling would occur (the predicted target for efficacy). dose selection for rimegepant in migraine was supported from preclinical and phase 1 safety data as well as pd data in primates (marmosets) using the cgrp-induced dermal blood flow assay. this assay employs a strong agonist dose of human-αcgrp (10 μg/kg, iv) that is designed to mimic waves of cgrp release during a migraine attack (human plasma levels of cgrp rise substantially during migraine, reflecting cgrp release from trigeminal afferents). rimegepant was expected to inhibit cgrp-induced increases in dermal blood flow. in early studies, rimegepant 0.3 mg/kg sc produced ≤ 17% inhibition, 1 mg/kg produced up to 46% inhibition, 3 mg/kg produced up to 66% inhibition, and 7 mg/kg produced up to 80% inhibition of cgrp-induced increases in dermal blood flow. based on these data and multispecies allometric scaling, it was predicted that a human single dose of 70 to 140 mg would be efficacious in migraine with a cmax target

(goadsby et al. 2017) two of these agents, erenumab and eptinezumab, conducted pharmacodynamic inhibition efficacy-exposure studies to guide clinical dose selection in prevention. both agents showed that a cmax

rationale for dose selection from human pk modelling of eod (every other day) expected exposures and cgrp inhibition rimegepant has consistently shown sustained benefits through 48 hours after a single rimegepant 75 mg dose was administered for the treatment of migraine (cn170003, bhv3000-301, bhv3000-302, and bhv3000-303). most recently, single dose rimegepant 75 mg showed statistically significant effects over 2 to 48 hour on four measures of durable efficacy: sustained pain freedom 2 to 48 hour, sustained freedom from mbs 2 to 48 hour, sustained ability to function normally 2 to 48 hour and sustained pain relief 2 to 48 hour. these comprehensive and durable benefits through 48 hours from a single dose suggest that daily dosing would not be required for a clinically meaningful preventive effect. it has not been established that constant high blockade of cgrp-signalling is required for efficacy in the preventive treatment of migraine. other cgrp signal-blocking agents, including a long-acting injectable cgrp mab (erenumab) and daily dosing of another oral cgrp receptor antagonist (atogepant), have shown an unwanted signal of constipation when administered for the preventive treatment of migraine. therefore, as part of the rimegepant dose selection process the expected exposure profile and its potential effects on providing a more favourable safety/tolerability profile was considered. rimegepant has a favourable pk profile with a t1/2 of ~11 hours. in this regard, the pk profile of oral rimegepant has the potential to provide both effective therapy (with periods of maximal cgrp inhibition ≥ 90%) and a respite from prolonged blockade (by planned regular excursions into periods of lower cgrp inhibition) when administered in an eod regimen. a population pk model utilizing 10 clinical studies and 337 healthy subjects given doses ranging from 10 to 150 mg was used to simulate single-dose and steady-state rimegepant exposures (e.g., cmax, auc, and overall pk profiles) from dosing scenarios of interest. a representative population of virtual subjects (n = 1,000) were resampled from the analysis dataset demography.

</p>
<p>
values were 1.50 hours for the sl odt and 1.93 hours for the tablet. if placed on top of tongue, the median tmax was 2.0 hours for odt, as compared to 2.3 hours for the tablets (study 113). hence, the benefit of the odt formulation as compared to tablets in terms of rapid increase in blood levels is not evident. however, it is acknowledged that due to associated symptoms of nausea / vomiting it may be advantageous for some patients to administer the odt tablet without water in acute migraine attacks. a considerable food effect was observed for the odt formulation. rimegepant odt, administered either sublingually or on top of tongue, has a lower rate and extent of absorption after ingestion of a standard high-fat meal when compared to fasting conditions. the gmrs for auc and cmax reduced by 32% and 41% after sublingual administration (study 112), and by 38% and 53%, if placed on top of tongue (study 113). under fed conditions, maximum plasma concentration are achieved about one hour later as compared to the fasted state (mean tmax: fed 3.4 hour, fasted 2.4 hour). in clinical trials, rimegepant was administered irrespective of any meals taken or not. by its nature as a medication designed for acute treatment of migraine attacks, which are often accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting, any recommendation in terms of food intake may hardly reflect clinical practice. in any way, given the magnitude of food effect, smpc section 5.2 gives due account about the food effect on the pk of rimegepant. it is important for transferability of pivotal clinical data obtained with the rgp tablet, that the food effect observed for the tablet formulation was similar in nature (decrease of auc, cmax; delay of tmax by about one hour) and magnitude as compared to odt. study 120 further examined the food effect observed in studies 112/113 by measuring the exposure of rimegepant (75 mg odt, sublingual) after ingestion of a low-fat, low calorie (exactly half the calorie amount [400-500 calories] and fat content [25%], as compared to a standard high-fat meal). in general, pk results obtained from study 120 (low-fat, low-calorie meal) confirm those previously obtained from study 112, which examined the food effect of a high-fat, high-calorie standard meal. while ingestion of a high-fat meal lead to about 32% resp, 41% decrease of auc and cmax (study 112) after sd sublingual administration of rimegepant 75 mg odt, auc was reduced by 28% and cmax was reduced by 36% if the respective meal contained half as much fat / calories (study 120). under both conditions, tmax was delayed by 1-1.5 hours under fed conditions. along the same line as the food effect observed for rimegepant, the availability of rgp (if administered as free base) appears to be dependent on ph conditions in the git. in part a of study cn170001, pre-treatment with histamine-2 antagonist famotidine (150 mg, 2 hour prior to rimegepant dosing) lead to markedly reduced rimegepant exposure (cmax and auc reduced by 75% resp. 57%). the decreased availability of rimegepant after prior treatment with antacids is in line with rgp’s ph solubility profile revealing an about 100-fold decrease in solubility if the ph is increased from ph 1.4 to ph 6.8. in [14c] mass balance study cn170006, radio-chromatographic profiling of plasma, urine and faecal samples revealed that in plasma, unchanged parent was the most prominent drug-related circulating component, no major metabolite (i.e., representing &gt;10% of drug-related material) was present in plasma. the auc0-inf ratio of rimegepant to total radioactivity was 77%, which indicated that although there were metabolites in the circulation, rimegepant was predominant. on the other side, rimegepant was extensively metabolised to a wide variety of minor metabolites with an overall low rate of metabolic clearance prior to elimination. the primary biotransformation pathway was the cleavage of the carbamate bond of the rgp molecule, apart from hydroxylation and formation of a number of minor secondary oxidative metabolites. rimegepant and its metabolites were primarily eliminated in the faeces

and cmax values were 34-21% resp. 42-21% lower during the non-migraine control period as compared to administration during an acute attack. as concerns tmax (mean), results are not consistent. while for the 300 mg dose peak rgp concentrations were achieved about 30 min earlier during an acute attack, it took about 35 min longer for the 600 mg dose. median tmax values, however, were equal for the 600 mg dose under both conditions (2.0 hour). in essence, although study cn170004 did not examine the 75 mg rgp dose, it can be concluded that an acute migraine attack does not appear to negatively impact the rate and extent of rimegepant absorption. pharmacokinetics in special populations dedicated studies were conducted in renally and hepatically impaired subjects and the elderly were undertaken to characterize the pk profile of rimegepant in special populations. in hepatic impairment study 107, a sd of 75 mg rimegepant was administered to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment as compared to matched healthy controls. administration of a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant to subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment resulted in similar cmax and auc0-inf values compared to matched controls, whereas both rate and extent of rgp absorption in subjects with severe hepatic impairment were elevated approximately 2-fold. the applicant’s

conclusions on clinical pharmacology taken together, it is concluded that a comprehensive pk data package was provided. the pk of rimegepant in special populations was adequately characterised. the rationale for eod dosing of 75 mg rimegepant to achieve a 90% inhibition of cgrp signalling in migraine prevention was based on nonclinical testing in marmosets, published data for other cgrp antagonists, and pk/pd modelling.  there are principle differences in the way migraine “prophylaxis” is achieved between rimegepant and other orally administered preventive agents, like ß-blockers, topiramate, antidepressants or others.  2.7.

migraine prevention study 305 bhv3000-305 was a multi-centre study to assess the safety and efficacy of rimegepant 75 mg in migraine prophylaxis. the study consists of 4 phases: a 28-day screening phase, a 12-week double-blind treatment (dbt) phase, a 52-week open-label extension (ole) phase, and an 8-week follow-up safety phase. screening phase the screening phase included a screening visit and a 28-day observation period (op). the subject’s migraine history and medical history were collected at the screening visit. upon completion of the screening visit, subjects were provided an electronic diary (ediary) to document each day of the 28-day op if a migraine occurred and the migraine intensity and characteristics. subjects recorded the standard of care migraine treatment received on a paper diary and female subjects recorded their menstrual period information on a paper log. double-blind treatment phase after completing the 28-day op, subjects returned to the clinic for the baseline visit, during which their eligibility for continued participation in the study was assessed. if eligible, subjects were randomised and entered the 12-week dbt phase (weeks 1 through 12), during which they were instructed to take 1 tablet of blinded study drug (rimegepant 75 mg or placebo) eod. if subjects had a migraine during the

prophylaxis study 305 overall, 747 subjects were randomised, and 741 subjects were treated with rimegepant (370 subjects) or placebo (371 subjects) in the dbt phase. the reasons that 6 subjects were randomised but not treated were due to protocol deviations (2 rimegepant subjects and 2 placebo subjects) and lost to follow-up (1 rimegepant subject and 1 placebo subject). there are no ongoing subjects in the dbt phase. the majority of treated subjects (626/741, 84.5%) completed the dbt phase. the most common reasons for the 115 treated subjects not completing the dbt phase were withdrawal by subject (11 rimegepant subjects and 22 placebo subjects), lost to follow-up (19 rimegepant subjects and 12 placebo subjects), and eligibility failure due to baseline laboratory values (8 rimegepant subjects and 13 placebo subjects).

if the sensitivity analysis applying glmem but with jump-to-reference to impute missing data, the net difference between rimegepant and placebo in evaluable mitt subjects in terms of md reduction throughout the last 4 weeks (wk 9-12) of the dbt is diminished to -0.7 mds (p=0.0400), as compared to the primary glmem analysis yielding a net difference of -0.8 mds (p=0.0099).

during the op subjects experienced 10.3 (rimegepant) resp. 9.9 (placebo) mds. in both arms, the number of mds per 28-day assessment period decreases constantly per month throughout the 12-week dbt period. in terms of percent reduction, the number of mds was reduced by -50.3% in rimegepant subjects, while placebo subjects achieved to reduce the mean number of mds from week 9-12 by -41.7%. the overall net difference of -0.7 mds per month between rimegepant and placebo corresponds to less than 10% of the number of mds experienced at baseline. the applicant specified that subjects must have &gt; 14 days of efficacy data (not necessarily consecutive) in the specified month to be counted as mitt evaluable. the portion of subjects not considered mitt evaluable due to less than 14 days of ediary efficacy data in any of the 3 treatment months (28 day intervals) was about equally distributed across arms (rimegepant 5.9%, placebo 6.5%).

use of rescue throughout the 12-week dbt period, subjects could use their individual rescue medication (incl. triptans, nsaids, antiemetics) in case an acute migraine attack occurred despite preventive study medication. across arms and the three 28-day treatment intervals of the dbt, subjects used rescue on a mean of about 4-5 days per month. rimegepant did not significantly separate from placebo in any of the three 28-day intervals of the dbt in terms of rescue medication use.

subgroup analyses a number of subgroup analyses were conducted. factors like age, sex, bmi, number of baseline mds (&lt;14 or &gt; 14 mds), history of cm did not impact on the outcome for the primary endpoint. however, subjects recruited for study 305 were stratified according to concomitant prophylactic migraine medication yes or no. in the subgroup of subjects receiving concomitant non-study migraine prophylactic medication (rimegepant arm: 75/348, 21.6%), rimegepant numerically hardly separated from placebo. throughout the last period of the dbt (week 9-12) subjects with non-study preventive medication reduced the mean number of mds by -3.5 in the rimegepant arm as compared to a reduction of -3.4 (p=0.8993) in the placebo arm.

open-label extension phase, study 305 ole at the completion of the 12-week dbt phase, subjects could enter into the 52-week ole phase (weeks 13 through 64) if they continued to meet study entry criteria and laboratory test results were acceptable per protocol. the 52-week ole period of study 305 was still ongoing at the time of dossier submission. carry-over to ole from the dbt period was high. the vast majority of evaluable mitt subjects (rimegepant: 302/348 [86.8%], placebo: 301/347 [86.7%]) continued treatment and entered the ole period. during the ole phase, subjects were instructed to take one tablet of rimegepant 75 mg every other calendar day. if subjects had a migraine on a day that they were not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, they could take one tablet of rimegepant 75 mg on that calendar day to treat a migraine. therefore, during the ole phase, subjects could take a maximum of one rimegepant 75 mg tablet per calendar day for this 52-week period. contrary to the dbt, triptans were not allowed as rescue during the ole. the figure below displays the mean change in total mds per month data for open-label evaluable rimegepant mitt subjects.

in open-label, long-term safety study 201, subjects were not randomised, but allocated to three different enrolment groups according to the self-reported historical rate of migraine attacks per month for the subjects preceding enrolment in the cohort: prn (2-8) [n=1033], prn (9-14) [n=481], and eod+prn (4-14) [n=286]. in prn groups rimegepant could be taken as needed (max. 1 tablet 75 mg rpg per day) over 52 weeks, in the eod+prn group, which was treated for 12 weeks, rimegepant was administered prophylactically eod plus the option to take rimegepant on non-scheduled days for acute attacks.  subject demographics do not inform about mds prior to study entry, hence, do not specify whether subjects suffered episodic or cm. the self-reported number of migraine attacks per month was 4.9 (prn 2-8 group), 10.8 (prn 9-14 group), resp. 6.8 in the eod+prn (4-14) group.

discussion on clinical efficacy design and conduct of clinical studies the sponsor introduces rgp as the first orally administered cgrp antagonist to demonstrate benefit for both the acute treatment and prophylaxis of migraine. accordingly, vydura™ is proposed to be indicated for the comprehensive management of migraine in adults, including prophylaxis of migraine and acute treatment of migraine with or without aura.  the wide indication proposed by the applicant does not differentiate between em or cm subtypes. the present assessment of the clinical dossier was based on currently valid diagnostic criteria (ihcd-3) and most recent european resp. ihs treatment guidance, which make a clear distinction between both the em and cm target population, and the acute vs preventive treatment approach. the clinical dossier of rimegepant includes efficacy data from two separate sets of clinical studies that were provided for the acute (single attack studies 301 [n=1.084] / 302 [n=1.072] / 303 [n=1.351]) and preventive treatment (study 305 [n=695]) of migraine under randomised, placebo-controlled conditions. supportive data include phase 2b dose-ranging study cn170003 ([n=811], with capsule) establishing rimegepant 75 mg as the minimum effective dose, and a phase 2/3, open-label, long-term safety study where subjects could receive rimegepant 75 mg doses for up to 52 weeks (201 [n=1.800]). all studies were conducted in the us. single aspects of the phase iii programme were designed according to current ihs resp. ema guideline provisions, like e.g. the choice of efficacy endpoints. however, a number of uncertainties resp. shortcomings were also identified, which will be further explored in the following. with regard to acute treatment of migraine, single attack studies 301, 302 and 303 followed standard guidance and were almost identical in design, apart from the study drug formulation (study 303 with final odt formulation, studies 301/302 with intermediate tablet formulation). bioequivalence between the tablet and odt formulation was established.  as concerns migraine attack frequency, subjects were required to have suffered not more than 8 attacks of moderate / severe intensity per month, and have suffered less than 15 days with headache (migraine

conclusions on clinical efficacy to support the claimed comprehensive management of migraine in adults, including prophylaxis and acute treatment, four pivotal rcts were provided to demonstrate the efficacy of rimegepant in acute migraine treatment (single attack studies 301/302/303) and migraine prevention (study 305). statistical significant effects along primary efficacy endpoints could be shown, however, the following considerations need also to be taken into account.  •
</header>
<p>
the placebo-subtracted treatment effect observed across the 3 pivotal single attacks studies (net risk difference over placebo for 2-hour pain freedom: 301: 4.91%, 302: 7.59%, 303: 10.37%) is modest.  •
</p>
<p>
a guideline-conforming prospective, placebo-controlled proof of within-patient consistency in acute migraine is lacking. exploratory data obtained from acute migraine treatment during ole of study 305 on unscheduled eod dosing days were provided post hoc. these provide some insight into reproducibility of treatment success in consecutive acute attacks, however, have severe limitations. they reflect uncontrolled open-label conditions in patients with maintenance eod preventive dosing that could only take rimegepant for acute migraine on non-scheduled dosing days. a focused analysis in subgroups of patients with &gt; 3 moderate to severe mds (n=350) and those with &gt; 4 mds (n=310) was provided on the first 3 resp. 4 attacks, detailing the number of patients achieving 2-hours pain freedom in 0, 1, 2, 3, (4) of the first attacks and calculating the portion of subjects achieving pain freedom in at least 2 out of first 3, resp. 3 out of first 4 attacks.
</p>
<p>
the profile obtained largely corresponds to the modest treatment effect already observed across the single attack studies 301/302/303. in both subgroups of patients with &gt; 3, respectively &gt; 4 moderate to severe migraine attacks, more than half of patients could not successfully treat a single attack of the first three resp. four attacks (0 out of 3: 58.4%; 0 out of 4: 52.4%). only a very small minority of patients achieved pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose in every single of the first 3 resp. 4 attacks (3 out of 3: 5.3%; 4 out of 4: 3.4%).
</p>
<p>
as could be expected, the magnitude of requested within-patient consistency parameter (2 out of 3: 16.5%, resp. 3 out 4: 9.7%) is considerably smaller than the average absolute responder rates observed across the three single attack studies 301/302/303 of 19-21% (placebo 10.9 – 14.2%). •
</p>
<p>
in study 305, the net difference over placebo in terms of md reduction was limited (-0.8 mds for the primary glmem analysis; -0.7 mds for the relevant jump-to-reference sensitivity analysis over a 28-day treatment period (week 9-12) of dbt), corresponding to less than 10% of the mean number of md at baseline (10.3-9.9 mds). •
</p>
<p>
the modest treatment effect for the primary endpoint goes along with non-significant treatment effects in relevant subgroups of patients (e.g. cm history, subjects with less than 8 attacks per month, subjects &gt; 65 years of age, subjects continuing their non-study prophylactic medication). the applicant claimed a broad indication of migraine prevention irrespective of em or cm classification. however, the cm subgroup was too small to be able to show any effect independently. furthermore, data does not allow a precise estimation on the treatment effect in this subgroup

as of 03-sep-2020, more than 7,200 subjects have participated in phase 1 studies in healthy subjects or phase 2 and 3 studies in subjects with migraine in the rimegepant clinical development programme. among these subjects, more than 3,800 unique subjects have received the rimegepant clinical dose of 75 mg in phase 2 and 3 studies, including 1,857 unique subjects who received rimegepant 75 mg in single-dose studies: 1,771 unique subjects in the three pivotal phase 3 single-dose, placebo-controlled acute treatment studies (i.e., bhv3000-303, bhv3000-302, and bhv3000-301), and 86 subjects in the phase 2b dose-ranging study cn170003. safety data are also available for the 2,471 subjects who received rimegepant 75 mg in the phase 2/3 multiple-dose studies (bhv3000-201 and bhv3000-305).  in the pivotal migraine prophylaxis study (bhv3000-305), the ole phase remains ongoing as of the safety snapshot for this summary and a total of 527 subjects received rimegepant (eod or eod + prn up to qd) for at least 6 months, and 311 subjects received rimegepant for at least 1 year. overall, among the 1,800 subjects treated in bhv3000-201 with an average rimegepant exposure of ≥

discussion on clinical safety safety data were analysed in pooled groups of phase 2 and 3 single-dose (301, 302, 303) and multiple-dose (201, 305) studies in subjects with migraine who were treated with rimegepant 75 mg or placebo. also, safety data were evaluated in healthy subjects receiving rimegepant doses ranging from single doses of 25 mg through 1,500 mg, multiple-dose regimens of up to 600 mg qd for 14 days, or 300 mg twice daily for up to 14 days. exposure the safety database comprises a total of n=4,628 unique treated subjects receiving either single or multiple doses of rimegepant throughout the clinical development programme. these include a total of 527 subjects receiving rimegepant (eod or eod + prn up to qd) for at least 6 months, and 311 subjects receiving rimegepant for at least 1 year. the ole period of study 305 was ongoing at the time of dossier submission and has reached its final database lock on 23-april-2021. the minimum requirements for drug exposure as specified per ich e1 guidance are fulfilled. demographics at screening, subjects were identified that present with a contraindication to triptan use. these were not per se excluded from single or multiple attack studies. contraindications to triptans mainly concern cv safety. however, patients with uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed cv disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, mi, acute coronary syndrome etc. were excluded from 301/302/303/305. hence, there is large overlap between the cv contraindications to triptans and the cv study exclusion criteria, which explains the low portion (0.4-1.2%) of subjects with apparent contraindications to triptans, but eligibility for studies 301/302/303. the applicant will conduct a pass of rimegepant in patients with migraine and a history of cardiovascular diseases to further characterise this population.

<p>
subjects with general risk factors for cv disease that did not contraindicate triptan use (e.g. family history of coronary artery disease, treatment for hypertension, current smoker, treatment with a statin, or history of diabetes) were included in rimegepant trials. no upper limit of age was defined. the mean age of study participants was around 40 years. the subgroup of subjects &gt; 65 years of age was small, around 2-3% in sd studies and 5.8% in prevention study 305. moh is common among severely affected patients requiring prophylactic migraine medication. the portion of subjects with existing moh at the entry of long-term studies 201 and 305 is unclear. subjects with moh were initially excluded both from study 305 and 201. however, in study 201 this restriction was removed with revised protocol v2.0. in study 305, 22.7% of subjects presented with a history of cm after implementation of protocol

conclusions on clinical safety the clinical safety profile of rimegepant in the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine is obtained from n=4,628 unique treated subjects receiving either single or multiple doses throughout the clinical development programme. by the entirety of available data, the safety profile of the orally administered cgrp antagonist rimegeapnt is considered rather favourable. on-treatment aes related to study drug in long-term study 201 comprise mainly unspecific aes like nausea (1.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhoea (0.4%), dizziness (1.5%). somnolence (1.1%). the first pbrer covering the first 6 months of marketing in the us (acute migraine indication) confirms findings based on the clinical trial data package. these include rather modest efficacy on the one side and overall good tolerability on the other side. 2.9.

disease or condition migraine is a serious, chronic, disabling neurological disease characterised by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully treated. people with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 3.1.2.

available therapies and unmet medical need according to current treatment guidelines, unspecific analgesics like acetylic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol etc. rank among first-line therapies, however, are typically used for less severe migraine attacks. major progress in more specific treatment of acute migraine symptoms was achieved with the advent of the triptans in the nineties. triptans target 5-ht1b and 5-ht1d receptors and their mechanism is thought to involve cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release (rizatriptan smpc). as the gold standard for acute treatment of migraine, they represent 28% to 36% of prescribed

main clinical studies the clinical dossier of rimegepant includes efficacy data from two separate sets of clinical studies that were provided for the acute (single attack studies 301 [n=1.084] / 302 [n=1.072] / 303 [n=1.351]) and preventive treatment (study 305 [n=695]) of migraine under randomised, placebo-controlled conditions. in terms of baseline demographics of acute migraine studies, the mitt population is considered as typically representative of the migraine target population in terms of age (mean of 40-42 years, 96.8% &lt; 65 years), gender (85-89% female), history of migraine with aura (30-37%), and the portion of subjects receiving preventive medication (13-17%). at screening, about one third of subjects was currently using triptans for the treatment of acute attacks. the mean duration of migraine history is about 20 years at study entry. the median number of moderate to severe migraine attacks per month is 4.0 across treatment arms. the majority of subjects is considered moderately to severely affected by the disease.

favourable effects high rate of study completion in terms of subject disposition, study completion was very high across the 3 single attack studies 301/302/303 and dose arms (around 99% for rimegepant 75 mg and placebo), which does not surprise, given the shortness of intervention. equally, a high portion of subjects completed the 12-week double-blind treatment period of prevention study 305 (84.5%, equally distributed across arms: rimegepant 85.4%, placebo 83.6%). only very few subjects discontinued due to ae on dbt or subsequent ole period (n=13 [3.5%] rimegepant, n=5 [1.7%] placebo patients). about equal portions of subjects continued to the ole phase after terminating the dbt period (rimegepant: 81.6%, placebo: 81.4%). co-primaries in acute studies: effects significant, but modest across the 3 pivotal single attack studies, superiority over placebo could consistently be shown for both co-primary endpoints, i.e. portions of patients achieving pain freedom resp. mbs freedom at 2 hours post-dose.  secondaries in acute studies: modest effects, partly significant due to hierarchical testing a multitude of secondary efficacy endpoints were tested hierarchically in studies 301, 302. in line with ema guideline provisions, demonstration of sustained freedom of pain from 2-24 hours and/or from 2-48 hours post-dose were included. across all single attack studies, numerical differences in favour of rgp could be shown (risk difference (%) / p-values: pain freedom 2-24 hour: 301: 5.86 / 0.002, 302:

uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects liver enzyme elevations - hepatotoxicity a dedicated analysis of liver enzyme elevations and associated hepatotoxicity in patients receiving rimegepant was conducted to address concerns about potential hepatotoxic effects that were observed in other previously developed cgrp antagonist and lead to termination of their clinical study programme. there were no reported elevations of alt or ast &gt; 3 x uln with concurrent tbl &gt; 2 x uln among subjects treated with rimegepant in the double-blind or open-label phase. no cases of hy’s law have been identified, and there was no signal of dili due to rimegepant when administered at least eod for up to 64 weeks of treatment or up to once daily prn for up to 52 weeks of treatment. given the low number of hepatic–related aes, it is concluded that, based on available clinical data, there is no evidence of hepatotoxicity with the acute (prn, as needed) or eod preventive use of rimegepant 75 mg. however, relevant elevations of alt or ast (study 305 dbt or ole: &gt; uln: 20.9%), tbl (&gt; uln: 3.2%) and alp (&gt; uln: 10.0%) were observed both in pivotal migraine studies and in pk/pd studies with healthy volunteers. vital signs recordings of vital sign abnormalities were provided. however, these do not inform about the actual effect of rimegepant on vital signs, in particular when there is no placebo control and no temporal association between vital sign measurement (201/305: every 4 weeks) and as-needed administration of study medication (201). however, vital signs (bp, hr) were recorded in temporal relation to rpg administration in pk study cn170001 and qtc study 109. as part of pharmacology study 109, changes in hr post-dose were measured at numerous time points. no clinically relevant changes in hr were observed as compared to placebo. measurement of bp was less frequent. recordings of bp pre-dose were compared at one time point 3h-4h post-dose only. again, no clinically relevant changes in bp were found in healthy volunteers after 75 mg rimegepant administration in qtc study 109. withdrawal and rebound potential withdrawal of rimegepant resp. rebound of increased migraine attack frequency after abrupt cessation of longer term eod preventive dosing of rimegepant was not monitored during follow-up of studies 201 and 305. however, pts potentially indicative of withdrawal (e.g. irritability) were observed only very rarely (1/1693 of follow-up patients). medication overuse headache (moh) since moh is commonly encountered among patients requiring migraine preventive medication, the ihs guidance does not recommend to exclude moh patients, but to stratify accordingly. moh is widespread across a variety of headache medications with different modes of action. the liability of orally administered cgrp antagonist rimegepant as another type of drug contributing to the development of

importance of favourable and unfavourable effects rimegepant is introduced as the first orally administered cgrp antagonist with claimed benefit for both the acute treatment and prophylaxis of migraine. accordingly, vydura™ was proposed to be indicated for the comprehensive management of migraine in adults, including prophylaxis and acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. the clinical dossier of includes pivotal efficacy data from two sets of clinical studies that were provided for the acute (single attack studies 301/302/303) and preventive treatment (study 305) of migraine under randomised, placebo-controlled conditions. supportive data include phase 2b dose ranging study cn170003 (with free base rgp capsules, establishing rimgepant 75 mg as the minimum effective dose) , and phase 2/3 open-label, long-term safety study 201, during which subjects could receive 75 mg rgp doses as needed for up to 52 weeks. the overall safety profile of rimegepant appears favourable. on-treatment aes related to the study drug comprise mainly unspecific aes like nausea (1.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhoea (0.4%), dizziness (1.5%), somnolence (1.1%) and were reported at low frequency. there were no signs for potential abuse or hepatotoxicity. no relevant effects on vital signs like hr or bp were observed. the effect size of rimegepant, however, was shown to be modest both in the acute and prophylactic clinical trial programme.  single attack studies 301/302/303 followed standard guidance and were almost identical in design. significant superiority over placebo could be shown in terms of the co-primary endpoints, freedom from pain and most-bothersome associated symptoms at 2 hours post-dose. the magnitude of effect, however, was modest. the modest treatment effect, shown in single attack studies, contributes to concerns that arise from the lacking proof of consistency of effect across multiple attacks. although a consistency of effect study was planned and discussed within the scope of chmp-sa (may 2018), no such data were actually provided. concerns over consistency of effect are further underlined by the poor outcome of long-term study 201. in the largest prn(2-8) enrolment group (n=1023), representing the majority of patients in clinical practice, i.e. subjects with a history of 2-8 attacks experienced per month, mean md were not reduced over the 52-week treatment period, as compared to the 28-day op. concerns over lacking proof of within-patient consistency were addressed by exploratory analysis of efficacy data obtained from prn use of rimegepant on unscheduled days during the ole period of study 305. a focused analysis in subgroups of patients with &gt; 3 moderate to severe mds and those with &gt; 4 mds was provided on the first 3 resp. 4 attacks. the profile obtained largely corresponds to the modest treatment effect already observed across the single attack studies 301/302/303. as could be expected, the magnitude of requested within-patient consistency parameter is considerably smaller than the average absolute responder rates observed across the three single attack studies 301/302/303 of 19-21%. the limitations of the requested post hoc data on the efficacy of rimegepant for acute migraine attacks experienced during the ole period of study 305 are evident: they were generated post hoc under uncontrolled, open-label conditions in patients receiving maintenance rgp on scheduled eod days and reflect only those attacks that were experienced on days not scheduled for regular eod preventive dosing. in the absence of guideline-conforming data prospectively demonstrating within-patient consistency, however, they provide some exploratory insight into within-patient consistency of effect of rimegepant in a series of 3-4 consecutive migraine attacks.

similarly, there remain concerns about the clinical relevance of the effect in prophylactic migraine treatment with rimegepant. during the 12-week dbt of study 305 migraine days were reduced by only -0.7 mds (net effect over placebo, p=0.040), corresponding to far less than 10% of the number of mds experienced during the observation period (rimegepant: 10.3, placebo 9.9 mds).  the clinical relevance of the -0.7 mds net difference over placebo is not supported by results for important secondary endpoints, like rescue medication use. in the relevant subgroup of patients with concomitant non-study prophylactic medication (rimegepant arm 75/348, 21.6%), rimegepant did not separate from placebo. equally, the modest treatment effect for the primary endpoint goes along with non-significant treatment effects in the subgroups of patients with cm history, subjects with less than 8 attacks per month, and subjects &gt; 65 years of age. it is acknowledged that study 305 was not powered to demonstrate significant effects in subgroups. on the other side, however, it is considered that the findings in subgroups round up the profile of rimegepant as a moderately effective agent. in the case of prevention study 305, subjects with a reported history of cm were initially excluded, however, were admitted with protocol amendment vs. 04 (07-march-2019). a stratified analysis according to migraine subtypes was not pre-specified. robust efficacy in the “cm history” subgroup could not be shown. this contrasts with the general label claim of comprehensive management of migraine in adults, irrespective of the underlying em/cm subtype. the available clinical database does not provide sufficient evidence for a positive b/r balance in the cm population. therefore, the wording of indication has been revised in section 4.1 of the smpc to restrict the indication of preventive migraine to those with em in adults who have at least 4 migraine attacks per month. with regard to timelines in the course of clinical development, it could be that the concept of also testing rimegepant for migraine prophylactic treatment was prompted after receipt of preceding single attack study results. the observation that rimegepent achieved sustained pain relief over 48 hours post-dose in a subgroup of patients in acute attacks, contributed to the concept of administering rimegepant in migraine prevention eod.  in so far, it is different from migraine prevention with other orally administered agents like ß-blockers, topiramate etc., for which no effect in acute attacks could be shown.  there are no controlled data to prove efficacy against acute attacks occurring in subjects receiving eod rimegepant for migraine prevention. separate rcts were undertaken for efficacy in single attacks (301/302/303) and prevention (305, 12-week dbt). the efficacy of rimegepant in acute attacks in eod patients was not shown under placebo-controlled conditions.  on the other side, it could be shown in the 1-yr ole period of study 305 that the reduction in mmds was maintained following the eod+prn dosing scheme. the mean number of mds per month during the initial observation period of study 305 was 9.9 mds/month (10.1 mds in previous rimegepant patients during dbt, 9.6 in placebo subjects). the major part of md reduction was then achieved during the subsequent 12-week dbt. nonetheless, the mean number of mds per month continued to decline throughout the 52-week ole period from a mean of 4.6 mds at month 1 (n=548) to 2.7 mds at month 13 (n=420).  a maximum daily dose of 75 mg rimegepant was specified, i.e. in case an acute attack occurs, rimegepant may only be taken on days not scheduled for regular eod dosing. it is unclear how restriction of rimegepant to be taken for acute treatment on non-scheduled days only, is compatible with clinical practice, which requires to treat acute attacks whenever they occur, irrespective of eod dose schedules.  the applicant argued that it would be common practice to have recourse to other types of rescue medication once the mdd maximum daily dose of the “standard therapy” is achieved. this is self-evident, however, contrasts with the claimed “comprehensive management of migraine” with a single agent, i.e. rimegepant. indeed, the use of rimegepant in case of an acute migraine attack occurring on a scheduled eod dosing day is ruled out.

further insight was obtained from an analysis how the remaining mds and rescue medication use spread across scheduled and unscheduled days across the 1-year ole period. the results do not indicate any substantive difference between scheduled and non-scheduled days in the mean number of remaining mds per month or in the mean number of rescue medication days per month. remaining mds were about equally distributed across scheduled and non-scheduled days across the 52-week ole. the overall open-label mean number of rescue medication days of 1.3 per month was also equally distributed between scheduled days and non-scheduled days. 3.7.2.

balance of benefits and risks the overall safety profile of rimegepant appears favourable. statistically significant superiority over placebo could be shown across primary endpoints, i.e. freedom of pain and mbs at 2-hours post-dose in acute treatment and for the reduction of mmds in migraine prevention. however, the magnitude of effect achieved in both treatment settings is considered modest. the clinical relevance of the net treatment effect over placebo may still be acknowledged in view of the favourable safety profile of rimegepant. the clinical database did not point to cv or hepatic safety risks associated with the use of rimegepant in acute and preventive migraine treatment. 3.7.3.
