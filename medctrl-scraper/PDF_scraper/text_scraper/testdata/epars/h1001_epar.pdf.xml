2.1.  introduction problem statement
</header>
<p>
nausea and vomiting are among the side effects associated with cancer treatment that patients and their families often fear the most. if nausea and vomiting are not controlled in a cancer patient, serious metabolic problems such as fluid and electrolyte balance disturbances and nutritional status deficiencies can develop. psychological problems associated with nausea and vomiting may include anxiety and depression. in addition, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting may also lead to the decision by the physician to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to the wish by the patient to stop potentially beneficial cancer therapy. cinv is classified as acute, occurring within the first 24h after chemotherapy, or delayed, occurring after the first 24h. the development of acute emesis is known to largely depend on serotonin (5-ht). the 5-ht3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response, thus providing a physiologic explanation for the demonstrated and clinically useful antiemetic effects of 5-ht3 receptor antagonists (ras). the pathophysiology of delayed emesis is less understood, and multiple mechanisms may contribute, including substance p. substance p belongs to the neurokinin (nk) family of neuropeptides and exerts its biological effects via interaction with the nk1 receptor.
</p>
<p>
presently, a four-level classification of intravenous chemotherapy agents, based on incidence of emetogenicity (high &gt;90%, moderate 30%-90%, low 10%-30% and minimal &lt;10%) has been accepted by the major organizations producing recommendations on antiemetics, who recommend that patients receiving hec regimens or mec regimens with anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide should be treated with a combination of a 5-ht3 ra, nk1 ra and a systemic corticosteroid.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
about the product
</header>
<p>
the proposed palonosetron-netupitant fixed combination (combination or fdc) is composed of palonosetron - (aloxi) - a registered 5-ht3 ra, and the new molecular entity, nk1 ra netupitant. it is a hard gelatin capsule for oral route.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron is a well-known potent and selective 5-ht3 receptor antagonist with demonstrated efficacy by the intravenous (i.v.) and oral route for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron 250 mcg solution for injection (aloxi eu/1/04/306/001) was approved via the centralised procedure on march 22, 2005 and is indicated in adults for:
</p>
<p>
• the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy,
</p>
<p>
• the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 11/153 palonosetron 500 mcg oral capsules (aloxi eu/1/04/306/002-003) were approved as a line extension application on may 5, 2010 and are indicated in adults for:
</p>
<p>
• the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
netupitant is a novel, potent and selective nk1 receptor antagonist. it has been shown to be a highly effective antiemetic in a variety of pre-clinical models. in human volunteers, the antiemetic effect of netupitant was assessed using an apomorphine challenge model. overall, netupitant appeared to reduce the incidence of emetic episodes following the apomorphine challenge in a concentration-dependent manner, with the incidence of vomiting decreasing as netupitant plasma concentration increased.
</p>
<p>
the characteristics of the two active pharmaceutical ingredients supported the development as a fixed combination, since their mechanism of action is exerted on different neuropathways (5-ht3 receptors and nk1 receptors) and both drugs show an extended half-life (approximately 40 and 90 hours for palonosetron and netupitant, respectively). the main advantages of the netupitant-palonosetron fixed-dose combination product are to improve patient compliance due to a simplification and convenience of therapy and to increase adherence to guidelines for administration of both a 5-ht3 and nk1 ra.
</p>
<p>
the claimed and approved indication is: akynzeo is indicated in adults for the: prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.

type of application and aspects on development
</header>
<p>
this marketing authorisation application (maa) for the combination capsule netupitant 300 mg - palonosetron 0.50 mg, for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in adult patients is a full application in accordance with directive 2001/83/ec as amended and regulation 726/2004. the development program of the product to support its marketing authorisation application (maa) was agreed with chmp during a scientific advice procedure, where clinical aspects were presented together with quality, multi-disciplinarily, and non-clinical items.
</p>
<p>
with regard to clinical efficacy and safety, the chmp agreed that the proposed netupitant/palonosetron combination is based on valid therapeutic principles, in accordance with guidance on fixed-dose combination (cpmp/ewp/240/95) and that the proposed safety and efficacy program, if successful, is suitable to support the registration of the combination in the hec and mec target therapeutic indication.
</p>
<p>
hec study netu-07-07: the chmp agreed that the study has the potential for consideration as the sole pivotal efficacy trial to support the hec indication, considering the robustness of results, and provided that the similar study conducted in mec induced cinv (netu-08-18) is similarly positive, since the hec and mec diseases are closely related. the netu-07-07 primary efficacy endpoint and analysis were considered adequate to demonstrate efficacy to support the proposed target indication in hec.
</p>
<p>
mec study netu-08-18: the chmp judged the proposed superiority design acceptable to provide evidence of efficacy and therefore to support the proposed target indication in mec. the choice of the
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 12/153 primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. proportion of patients with complete response in the delayed phase at cycle 1) and key secondary efficacy endpoints (i.e. proportion of patients with complete response in the acute and overall phases at cycle 1), including the proposed approach to address multiplicity for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in the study netu-08-18 were considered acceptable. the adoption of a 5% type i error (2-sided) was accepted for this single mec pivotal study since the results of the hec trial netu-07-07 were strongly supportive. the definition of the full analysis set (fas) was considered adequate for the primary efficacy analysis in cycle 1. for the primary efficacy analysis of the multiple cycle extension (mce) the party recommended to include all patients from the cycle 1 full analysis set in the mce full analysis set, because the proposed mce fas is not appropriate as patients were not re-randomised at the time of entering the mce. the proposed primary efficacy analysis in netu-08-18 was considered acceptable to demonstrate efficacy and the proposed patient population in netu-08-18 adequate to support the proposed target label.
</p>
<p>
safety hec and mec study netu-10-29: the comparator, the sample size assumption and the population (in term of represented chemotherapy regimens) were considered adequate to characterize the safety profile of the combination in chemotherapy repeated cycles.
</p>
<p>
hec study palo-10-01: as a general perspective, the chmp considered the study probably not necessary to provide evidence of efficacy of palonosetron 0.50 mg oral capsules in the hec setting, since the efficacy of oral palonosetron monotherapy in hec can be inferred both from its proven efficacy in mec and from the results of study netu-07-07, where the monotherapy arm performed far better than a non-active treatment could possibly achieve. the chmp considered the design of the study reasonable and the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with cr in the acute phase) acceptable. the 15% non-inferiority margin was deemed sufficiently narrow given the poor expected efficacy of placebo. the choice to set the type i error at 1% was judged even more stringent than requested; the definitions and proposed roles for populations of analyses in palo-10-01, were considered appropriate. the proposed primary efficacy analysis in palo-10-01 was considered acceptable to demonstrate efficacy. finally the proposed patient population in study palo-10-01 was adequate to support the proposed target label, in view of the proposed role of palo-10-01 in the development program of the combination.
</p>
<p>
in relationship to the overall characterization of the safety profile of the combination in the global registration program, the party considered it adequate in term of number of individuals and type of patient population and agreed on the adequateness of safety measures proposed in both clinical studies netu-08-18 and netu-10-29. based on the long half-lives of both compounds, it was recommended to add additional investigations approximately 10 days after dosing. finally, the chmp agreed on the adequateness of the global pk evaluation, including population pk/pd assessment, without performing a full pk study in cancer patients. a full waiver for a paediatric investigation plan for the combination was obtained based on the lack of significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for all subsets of the paediatric population (0 to 18 years of age) in the condition of prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (ema decision p/0014/ 2012 dated january 24, 2012).

general information
</header>
<p>
the information on netupitant is provided according to the active substance master file (asmf) procedure. the chemical name of netupitant is 2-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-n,2-dimethyl-n-[4-(2-methylphenyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridine-3-yl]propanamide and has the following structure and properties:
</p>
<p>
molecular formula: c30h32f6n4o
</p>
<p>
-
</p>
<p>
relative molecular mass: 578.61 gmol-1 the structure of netupitant was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy, ir spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and xrpd. netupitant is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. it is very slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in a range of organic solvents such as acetone, toluene, and methanol. the active substance is milled to reduce particle size. three physical forms are known, including unstable amorphous and solvated forms. the chosen commercial form is the most thermodynamically stable and is stable to the particle size reduction process. netupitant is achiral.
</p>

manufacture, characterisation and process controls
</header>
<p>
netupitant is synthesized convergently in nine main steps using commercially available, well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. five manufacturers are listed in the dossier with
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 14/153 responsibility for different steps in the netupitant manufacturing process, an additional two manufacturers are responsible for the subsequent micronization of the active substance. the characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the eu guideline on chemistry of new active substances. potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. genotoxic impurities can potentially form at several steps of the process. the applicant provided impurity spike and purge data to demonstrate that these are removed by the process and not present in the isolated active substance. in addition the applicant will test the first three batches of netupitant synthesized from intermediates sourced from each intermediate manufacturer for genotoxins, using the relevant analytical methods, to provide further assurance of active substance safety. adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. the specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the asmf and it was considered satisfactory.

general information
</header>
<p>
the information on palonosetron hydrochloride is provided according to the active substance master file (asmf) procedure. the chemical name of palonosetron hydrochloride is (3as)-2-[(s)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1h-benz[de]isoquinoline hydrochloride and it has the following structure and properties:
</p>
<p>
molecular formula: c19h24n2o.hcl
</p>
<p>
-
</p>
<p>
relative molecular mass: 332.87 gmol-1 the structure of palonosetron hydrochloride was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy, ir spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis. the absolute configuration was determined by xrpd. palonosetron hydrochloride is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. it is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in polar organic solvents, and practically insoluble in apolar organic solvents. palonosetron contains 2 stereocentres and is synthesized as the (s,s)-isomer. enantiomeric purity is controlled in the specification of the starting material which contains a single chiral centre, and by specific optical rotation in the active substance. the enantiomeric and diastereomeric impurities are controlled in the active substance specification. polymorphism has been observed for palonosetron hydrochloride but since it is in solution within the soft capsule formulation, its physical properties do not impact bioavailability and neither particle size nor polymorphic form is controlled.

manufacture, characterisation and process controls
</header>
<p>
palonosetron hydrochloride is synthesized by the asmf holder in three main steps using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. palonosetron hydrochloride purity is enhanced by recrystallization. the characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the eu guideline on chemistry of new active substances. potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. the specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the asmf and it was considered satisfactory.

stability data on three commercial scale batches of palonosetron hydrochloride from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºc / 60% rh), for 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºc / 60% rh), and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºc / 75% rh) according to the ich guidelines were provided. since the active substance is well-known and has been on the market (as aloxi) since 2003, the intermediate conditions pre-date ich q1a and are thus slightly different from the current guideline conditions. the following parameters were tested: appearance; assay; impurities; loss on drying; bioburden. the analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. there were no significant trends or changes to any measured parameter under any of the conditions.
</p>
<p>
photostability testing following the ich guideline q1b on 1 batch demonstrates that palonosetron hydrochloride is not photosensitive. stability data generated under stressed conditions (in aqueous solution at acidic and basic ph, at high temperature, on irradiation with light, and in the presence of h2o2) indicate that the main degradation pathway is oxidation. solid state studies show deliquescence and degradation at high temperatures and humidities. the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently stable. the stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

description of the product and pharmaceutical development
</header>
<p>
the aim of pharmaceutical development was to produce a dosage form containing fixed amounts of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride. palonosetron is already authorised in the marketed product aloxi, which is available both as a solution for injection and as soft capsules. netupitant is a new active substance. initial studies were focused on the compatibility of the two active substances and attempts to find a common formulation. no degradation was observed when netupitant and palonosteron were combined under a variety of conditions. however, the large difference in dose size (300 vs 0.5 mg) and differences in physicochemical properties, made co-formulation difficult. a solid form formulation of palonosetron was tested and displayed reduced potency, and dry mixtures containing both active substances had poor content uniformity. by contrast, the relatively large dose of netupitant was insufficiently soluble in suitable liquid vehicles for softgel capsule filling. thus, the decision was made to combine palonosetron softgel capsules with netupitant tablets inside a hard capsule.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 17/153 netupitant exhibits low aqueous solubility but high permeability (bcs class ii). in order to ensure a consistent dissolution profile, it is micronized to reduce particle size. all excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with ph. eur. standards or in-house specifications for non-compendial excipients. there are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. the tablets proposed for inclusion in the commercial formulation are round, flat and off-white. the critical quality attributes identified were appearance, identity, assay, purity, uniformity of dosage units, water content and dissolution. a series of bioequivalence studies enabled bridging between the various netupitant formulations used clinically. the choice of dissolution method was adequately justified and its discriminatory power has been demonstrated.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron is highly soluble and highly permeable (bcs class i). its physicochemical properties are not important for formulation purposes as it is in solution within the softgel capsules. the development of the softgels for akynzeo was based on the composition of aloxi. in order to reduce the softgel capsule size to enable it to fit within the larger hard capsule, the amount of glycerol monocaprylcaproate solvent was halved. other excipients were held at the same levels as in aloxi, and comprise butylated hydroxyanisole to prevent oxidative degradation as well as glycerine and water to prevent capsule hardening over time. the solubility and stability of palonosetron hydrochloride in the fill solution was demonstrated. the critical quality attributes identified were appearance, identity, assay, purity, uniformity of dosage units and dissolution. most excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with ph. eur. standards. non-pharmaceutical excipients are also used in the capsule shell but these are mixtures of well-known or pharmacopoeial excipients. the final image of akynzeo is white size 0 capsules with a caramel-coloured cap imprinted in black ink on the white part. each capsule contains three netupitant tablets and one palonosetron softgel capsule. the full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the smpc. the dissolution methods for the combined capsules are considered discriminatory. a switch was made late in the development programme from the white capsules with blue caps used in phase iii clinical studies as the colour faded over time. other than colour, there is no difference between the compositions of the two capsule types. the primary packaging is alu/alu blisters. the material complies with ph. eur. and ec requirements. the choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

manufacture of the product and process controls
</header>
<p>
the manufacturing process of intermediate netupitant tablets consists of five main steps: mixing of netupitant with intra-granular excipients followed by high shear wet granulation; drying and milling; blending with extra-granular excipients; compression to form tablets; bulk packaging. this is considered to be a standard manufacturing process and validation will be performed before commercialisation. acceptance limits have been defined for critical process parameters in the granulation, drying, and compression steps in order to meet the intended quality. the manufacturing process of intermediate palonosetron softgel capsules consists of four main steps: dissolution of palonosetron and excipients in the fill solution; encapsulation into softgel capsules and lubrication; drying and washing; bulk packaging. given the company’s experience of manufacturing aloxi softgel capsules using a similar method, this is considered to be a standard manufacturing process, and so validation will be carried out prior to commercialisation. in-process controls for the critical encapsulation step have been defined and are well justified. for the production of akynzeo hard capsules, three netupitant tablets and one palonosetron softgel capsule are filled into the size 0 hard capsules. controls are in place to ensure the correct filling of each
</p>
<p>

the finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and comprise tests for appearance of capsules (visual inspection), identity (hplc, uv), assay (hplc), impurities (hplc), bha content (hplc), dissolution (ph. eur.) and microbial enumeration (ph. eur.). given the final dosage form comprises netupitant tablets and palonosetron softgels combined in a hard capsule, certain parameters are tested in the intermediate standalone dosage forms as follows:
</p>
<p>
netupitant tablets: appearance (visual inspection), identity (hplc, uv), uniformity of dosage units (ph. eur.), impurities (hplc), dissolution (ph. eur.) and loss on drying (ph. eur.). palonosetron softgels: appearance and aspect of content (visual inspection), identity (hplc, uv), uniformity of dosage units (ph. eur.), impurities (hplc), assay (hplc), dissolution (ph. eur.), bha content (hplc), and microbial enumeration (ph. eur.). the applicant committed to re-evaluate the dissolution specification as a review of the consistency of manufacturing and in vitro performance. the analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ich guidelines. analysis results are provided for five batches of combination capsules. additional data on three commercial batches of a previous product format with different coloured capsules, and six batches used in clinical trials made by different manufacturers, including the commercial one, were provided as additional information and support the above conclusions. analysis results are also provided for intermediate netupitant tablets, (nine commercial scale batches from the commercial manufacturer and four from a previous manufacturer), and for intermediate palonosetron softgel capsules (eight commercial scale batches). the combined provided data confirms the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

stability data on three commercial scale batches of the blue/white capsules and three commercial scale batches of the caramel/white capsules stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºc / 60% rh), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºc / 65% rh), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºc / 75% rh) according to the ich guidelines were provided. the finished product was stored in the proposed commercial container closure system and manufactured using the proposed manufacturing process by the proposed manufacturer. samples were tested for appearance, aspect of the palonosetron softgels, assay (both active substances), impurities (from both active substances), bha content, dissolution (both active substances) and microbial enumeration. the analytical procedures used are stability indicating. there were no significant changes to any of the measured parameters under any condition, other than the fading of the blue colour in the blue/white capsules. some capsules from later time-points under all conditions required s2 and s3 testing to meet specification for dissolution, an observation attributed to hardening of the hard gelatin capsules over time and which is not considered an issue. in addition, one batch of caramel/white capsules was exposed to light as defined in the ich guideline on photostability testing of new drug substances and products indicating that akynzeo is not affected by exposure to light.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 19/153 bulk holding times were investigated on one batch of blue/white capsules for up to 24 months and one batch of caramel/white capsules for up to 9 months. a bulk holding time of up to 24 months is acceptable, starting from the date of manufacture of whichever intermediate product is produced first. bulk stability study results for one batch each of intermediate netupitant tablets and palonosetron softgels were also provided. the results support bulk holding times of up to 12 months for netupitant tablets and up to 24 months for palonosetron softgels. in line with the chmp/cvmp qwp q&amp;a document on “stability issues of pharmaceutical bulk products for use in manufacture of the finished product,” the applicant will made a commitment (located in the post-authorisation stability section for each intermediate product) to carry out bulk stability studies on an additional batch of each intermediate following a request from chmp. the applicant will continue the stability studies of the caramel/white capsules up to the end of the proposed shelf life, and bulk holding time. in addition, the first three commercial batches of akynzeo will be placed on long term stability studies. based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the smpc are acceptable.

primary pharmacodynamic studies
</header>
<p>
netupitant is a high affinity hnk1 receptor antagonist (comparable to substance p and the selective nk1 receptor antagonist mk869) with a 1000-fold greater selectivity for hnk2 and a 34 fold greater selectivity for hnk3.
</p>
<p>
while netupitant at 10 µm indicated approximately 3 orders of magnitude separation between affinity for the nk1 compared to over 50 other receptors and ion channels, interactions at the histamine (h2), adenosine (a3), da and 5-ht reuptake sites, l-type ca2+ channel and diltiazem binding site on the ca2+ channel were observed.
</p>
<p>
additional binding studies (reports netu-10-24, netu-10-16 and netu-12-13) were performed with netupitant and its metabolites (m1, m2, m3 and m4).
</p>
<p>
these studies demonstrate that netupitant and all its metabolites have a high affinity for nk1.
</p>
<p>
furthermore netupitant and m4 show 10,000 fold selectivity over nk2 and nk3 receptors.
</p>
<p>
binding of m1, m2, and m3 to nk2 and nk3 have not been performed.
</p>
<p>
however, based on the inhibition of foot-tapping in gerbils, netupitant and m3 showed comparable potency, whereas m1 and m3 were less potent. therefore, it cannot be excluded that m1 and m3 contribute to the pharmacological activity of netupitant. in further binding studies, the netupitant main metabolites, m1 was shown to interact at the l-type ca2+ channel (ic50 = 2.8 μm; ki = 1.4 μm). in clinical studies, an additional metabolite m4 (n-oxide, n-demethyl derivative) was detected.
</p>
<p>
this metabolite showed activity on hnk1 receptor (ic50 = 3.7 nm; ki = 1.6 nm) and on hnk3 (ic50 was 8 μm and the ki =8 μm).
</p>
<p>
intracerebroventricular injection of the nk1 agonist gr73632 produces a foot tapping response in gerbils which is inhibited by brain-penetrating antagonists of the nk1 receptor. this in vivo assay was employed to examine dose and time dependent effects of netupitant on foot tapping responses in gerbils.

<p>
netupitant blocked the foot-tapping response elicited by the central injection of gr73632 with an ed50 of approximately 0.5mg/kg p.o. and 1.5 mg/kg i.p. the plasma levels of netupitant necessary to achieve a robust inhibition (75%) of this effect were approximately 40ng/ml. the half-life of activity for netupitant was 48h in this test.
</p>
<p>
a 60 minute pre-treatment time with netupitant (3 mg/kg) was required for complete blockade of foot-tapping.
</p>
<p>
moreover, the three main metabolites m1, m2 and m3 were also examined for activity in the gerbil foot-tapping test.
</p>
<p>
these data concluded that m1 and me are active following ip administration and m1 is active following oral administration.
</p>
<p>
the pk for the m1 and m3 were not measured but given the affinity of these metabolites to the respective receptors it can be assume they are present. netupitant demonstrated antiemetic action in ferrets against various acute-induced and delayed models of emesis.
</p>
<p>
the ed50 for oral netupitant for the prevention of emesis induced by ap cisplatin in ferrets was approximately 0.2 mg/kg. netupitant administered orally as a single dose (3 mg/kg) was also found to completely block the acute (&lt;24h) phase of emesis produced by cisplatin and block up to 90-95% of delayed (24-72 h) phase of emesis produced by cisplatin.
</p>
<p>
plasma levels showed that both the parent compound and m1 metabolite were detectable up to 96 hours and were functional at points up to 72 hours (90-95% inhibition of cisplatin-induced emesis).
</p>
<p>
palonosetron is a highly specific 5-ht3 receptor antagonist and has significantly stronger receptor binding than some other such drugs, e.g. ondansetron, granisetron. the drug is highly effective in preventing antineoplastic-induced emesis in dogs and ferrets. it has no clinically significant action on other serotonergic receptors. m4 and m9 exhibited at least 100-fold less antagonistic activity than palonosetron and their activity is not considered clinically relevant.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and netupitant (1 mg/kg, p.o.), alone or in combination together with dexamethasone were able to prevent emesis induced by cisplatin up to 72 hrs.
</p>
<p>
the combination of
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 23/153 netupitant and palonosetron was thought to offer a greater therapeutic advantage versus the treatments alone in that the antiemetic action was 100% maintained for the entire 72 hr duration.

safety pharmacology programme
</header>
<p>
in a non-glp irwin study performed in rats, netupitant up 1000 mg/kg had no effects on gait, reflexes or other neurological signs.
</p>
<p>
furthermore, netupitant (3, 30, and 100 mg/kg p.o.) showed no signs of anti- or pro-convulsant activity in rats following an infusion with pentylenetetrazol. in vitro, netupitant and it’s metabolites (m1, m2 and m3) blocked herg k+ channels with ic50 of 0.76, 0.84, 43 and 4.4 µm, respectively.
</p>
<p>
in isolated canine ventricular mycoytes, netupitant and its metabolite m1 induced a very slight inhibition (21 ± % and 25 ± 2%, respectively) of ikr tail current whereas metabolite m3 induced 14 ± 2% and 57 ± 8% inhibition of ikr tail current at 3 and 30 μm, respectively.
</p>
<p>
netupitant was only tested to 3 μm owing to issues with solubility, m2 showed no effect up to 30 μm.
</p>
<p>
in isolated canine purkinje fibres, significant decreases in action potentials were seen with neupitant and its metabolites at concentrations &gt;3 μm.
</p>
<p>
in isolated canine papillary muscle, only the m3 metabolite was shown to induce significant increase in action potential duration at apd50, apd70 apd90. the safety pharmacology of palonosetron including central nervous system, respiratory system, autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal system, renal/urinary system, blood compatibility and hemodynamic and respiratory effects have been studied. moreover, extensive investigation of cardiovascular safety was performed. in vitro studies confirmed the expected effects of palonosetron, at high concentrations. in vivo studies using several species showed effects on cardiac conduction, but no torsades de pointes were observed, despite the use of doses up to 1 mg/kg (which is 300-fold higher than the proposed human dose). in vivo the combination of palonoestron and netupitant induced a slight prolongation of action potential duration in an in vivo guinea pig study and in an in vivo canine model produced decrease in atrio-ventricular conduction and ventricular depolarization rate associated with a prolongation of ventricular repolarization. cardiovascular effects were observed in conscious dogs with netupitant and its main metabolite m1 only after repeated administration (14-day) at the highest dosages (netupitant 50 mg/kg and m1 30 mg/kg).
</p>
<p>
these studies suggest that m1 is more likely to be associated with the onset of qt prolongation than netupitant – m1 exposure was also higher in the heart and with heart/plasma concentration ratio compared to netupitant (see pk section).
</p>
<p>
moreover exposure to m1 is quantitatively higher in the dog compared to human.
</p>
<p>
netupitant had no significant effect on respiratory, renal or gastrointestinal systems at doses up to 50 mg/kg (respiratory) and 100 mg/kg (renal and gastrointestinal).
</p>
<p>
palonosetron is an approved drug with a known preclinical and clinical safety profile.
</p>
<p>
while, no safety pharmacology studies investigating the respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems have reported with the netupitant/palonosetron combination, no significant effects on on gi, respiratory and cns were reported in the 13-week rat and dog studies.
</p>
<p>
no abuse liability/dependence potential or withdrawal behaviours were observed with netu/palo combination at doses similar to or higher then the proposed therapeutic dose in humans (i.e. 300/0.50 mg netu/palo p.o.).

2.3.3.  pharmacokinetics
</header>
<p>
the pharmacokinetics of netupitant and its major metabolites was determined following single and repeat doses in rats and dogs. distribution was investigated by whole body autoradiography following oral and intravenous doses of [14c]-netupitant, and plasma protein binding was investigated in human, rat, dog and gerbil in vitro. metabolite profiles were determined in rat and dog. absorption was determined following oral and intraperitoneal administration of netupitant in rats and oral administration in dogs and cynomolgous monkeys. absorption following oral administration was moderate with tmax of about 3.5 hours in rats and 2-5 hours in dogs depending on the salt used. in rats following iv administration netupitant had low to moderate clearance and a long apparent terminal half life. volume of distribution was high in all species. oral bioavailability in each species varied substantially between animals, with 42-105%, 34-83% and 37-62% in rats, dogs, and monkeys. the large variation is most likely due to the low numbers of animals used in the studies.
</p>
<p>
netupitant was highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins in all species. the mean percentage of free drug was 0.33% in man, 0.22% in dog, 0.31% in rat, 0.50% in gerbil and &lt; 1% in mouse. the in vitro plasma protein binding of the three major metabolites of netupitant, m1, m2 and m3 was also determined in man, dog (swiss beagle) and rat. the plasma protein binding over 99% for m1 metabolite, and high for m2 metabolite were (2.3% (man), 2.2% (dog) and 0.65% (rat) free drug). for m3, plasma protein binding was 99% in rat and human and 97.5% in dog. in vivo distribution was determined by whole body autoradiography in rats. following oral doses of 10 mg/kg netupitant, distribution was extensive. radioactivity was seen highest (&gt;20 fold plasma exposure) in the harderian gland, followed by lung, adrenal, spleen, pituitary, exorbital and intraorbital lachrymal glands and thyroid. netupitant related material crossed the blood brain barrier, but was not detectable by 216 hours post-dose. the m1 metabolite was the predominant drug-related material by 24 hours, so distribution behaviour was considered to be due largely to m1. repeated administration indicated accumulation in nasal mucosa, mandibular lymph nodes, epididymis and choroid plexus. administration to pigmented rats showed 5-8 times greater levels in the uveal tract than in unpigmented animals. binding was reversible, and netupitant was not phototoxic in vitro. netupitant and its three major metabolites were shown to cross the blood brain barrier in a specific study in rats. in dogs, netupitant, m1 and m3 were measurable in the heart. at the end of the two 4 weeks toxicology studies and the telemetry study in dog m1 was on average approximately 5-fold more concentrated than netupitant in heart tissue. in human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver microsomal incubations, two major metabolites, an n-demethylation product (m1) and an n-oxidation product (m2), in addition to hydroxylation products (m3), were identified in all species. cyp3a4 was found to be responsible for the oxidation of netupitant to the same metabolites observed also in the incubations with human liver microsomes. in rats and dogs in vivo, the three major metabolites were all identified.
</p>
<p>
metabolism was extensive, with the metabolites generally reaching greater concentrations than parent drug by 24 hours. m1 and m2 exposure was similar in rat to humans, but higher in dogs, however m3 was lower in both species than in humans. in both rat and dog, excretion was predominantly by the faecal route, with over 85% of the administered dose recovered in faeces. less that 0.5% and 2% of dose was recovered in the urine in rats and dogs respectively. in dogs administered netupitant intravenously, recovery was largely in faeces, indicative of biliary excretion. in rat and dogs, elimination was very slow. in rats excretion was not complete after 1 week following oral or iv dosing, with 6% of the oral dose remaining in the carcass. in dogs, 87.8% and 88.1% of the dose was recovered following oral and iv dosing at two weeks post-dose, and radioactivity
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 25/153 was detectable 1008 hours after the dose. the data indicate that drug related material is eliminated very slowly and persist in the species tested for considerable time following administration. for palonosetron, protein binding was approximately 48 % in rat and 66 % in dog plasma. the moderate extent of plasma protein binding suggests that small changes would have no influence on palonosetron availability. palonosetron was extensively distributed, including to the brain. it did not accumulate and is rapidly cleared. no metabolites were measured in the brain, suggesting that they did not pass the blood-brain barrier or were cleared very rapidly. palonosetron was rapidly absorbed in rats and dogs when administered orally. despite high absorption, oral bioavailability was low in rats and dogs (6.4% and 12.5 % respectively), attributed to a strong firstpass effect in all two species, which suggest the possibility that some animal toxicities may not be relevant to humans. a range of metabolites was identified from animal oral studies but many were not relevant to the clinical situation, being products of first-pass metabolisms. in accordance with “the guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinatons of medicinal products” (emea/chmp/swp/258498/2005), pharmacokinetic studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are not required.

repeat dose toxicity
</header>
<p>
a number of preliminary, non-pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in rat and dog to examine the effects of netupitant alone and in combination with palonoestron.
</p>
<p>
the applicant has provided results from a series of non-pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies (&lt;1 month) conducted in mice, rats and dogs.
</p>
<p>
the majority of these studies were performed to glp and presented preliminary/dose range finding for the pivotal studies.
</p>
<p>
the main findings for netupitant alone amounted to effects on body weight and food consumption, changes in clinical chemistry parameters, increased liver and adrenal weight increases and occurred at all doses in some studies.
</p>
<p>
microscopic findings included changes in the lung, lymphoid tissues, liver, adrenal glands, kidney, stomach and trachea. some of these changes occurring at does as low as 15 mg/kg were indicative of drug-induced phospholipidosis (foamy/vacuolated macrophage infiltration) with associated necrosis.
</p>
<p>
in combination studies in rats (1 week and 28 day) dosed with palonosetron/netupitant (0/0-60/30 mg/kg) reduced body weight and/or body weight gain, reduced food consumption, changes in clinical pathology and blood parameters, increases in liver and kidney weights, minimal hepatocytic hypertrophy and syncytial macrophages in mesenteric lymph nodes were observed.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 27/153 similarly in dogs, decreases in body weight and food consumption were observed at all dose levels (10/3 and 20/15 mg/kg palonosetron/netupitant).
</p>
<p>
several clinical signs were also seen relating to cns (tremors to severe seizure-like episodes, calm or restless behaviour, abnormal posture, uncoordinated movements, salivation, squeaking, head shaking), as well as effects on heart (prolonged st and qt intervals) and liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy) at 15/7.5 and 20-15/15 mg/kg palonosetron/netupitant doses. as in the non-pivotal studies, the main toxicity findings observed in rats at higher dose levels were in relation to microscopic changes in various organs (liver (hepatocellular vacuolation), lungs (infiltration by foamy macrophages), spleen (histiocytosis), mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes (diffuse histiocytosis and histiocytic aggregates)) that were consistent with drug induced phospholipidosis.
</p>
<p>
these changes were completely or at least partially in the case of liver, lung and lymph nodes reversible after an 8 week recovery period.
</p>
<p>
no evidence of drug-induced lamellar inclusion bodies was observed at dose up to 450 mg.
</p>
<p>
reduced body weight, body weight gain and food consumption, changes in clinical parameters (increased protein, globulin, cholesterol levels &amp; changes in various liver enzymes) were again observed in these studies but these were considered related treatment induced inflammatory changes in some organs and microscopic changes in the liver.
</p>
<p>
increased liver and kidney (female only) weights were also observed.
</p>
<p>
noaels of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg were established for the 13 week and the 26 week repeat-dose toxicity, respectively. in the 13 week pivotal study in dogs, mild drug induced phospholipidosis was observed as indicated by vacuolated macrophages in lymphoid tissue in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg).
</p>
<p>
however this was reversible upon the 8 week recovery period.
</p>
<p>
in the 9 month study, slightly longer qt intervals (males only) and prolonged pq intervals were noted in high dose animals but were reversible upon cessation of treatment. increased liver weights with correlated microscopic evidence of minimal periacinar hepatocytic hypertrophy and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in the plasma were also seen in the high dose males.
</p>
<p>
as with all other studies, changes in body weight and body weight gain and reduced food consumption were also apparent.
</p>
<p>
a noael of 3 mg/kg was established for both studies. in rat combination studies with palonosetron / netupitant (0, 2/1, 6/3, 18/10, 18/0, or 0/10 mg/kg), the main target organs identified were the adrenals in females and liver and mesenteric lymph node in males and females.
</p>
<p>
toxicities amounted to adrenal zona fasciculate hypertrophy at 118/10 and 0/10 mg/kg which was reversible at the end of the recovery period; reversible hepatocytic hypertrophy in high dose females at combination therapy (18/10), as well as for males and females with netupitant monotherapy (0/10) and for females with palonosetron monotherapy (18/0).
</p>
<p>
these liver changes were also associated with increased liver weights.
</p>
<p>
mesenteric lymph node syncytial macrophages with increasing severity were also observed at 6/3 (females), 18/10 (males and females) and 0/10 mg/kg (males and females).
</p>
<p>
these findings were not reversible at the end of the recovery period and are thought to represent a precursor to phospholipidosis which was one of the main toxicity findings seen in the repeat dose toxicity studies.
</p>
<p>
of note form the toxicokinetic studies, after single administration of the combination product some gender differences were observed where exposure in males was lower than that observed in females particularly in the 6/3 dose group. the noael for this study was 2/1 mg/kg palonosetron/netupitant. in dog combination studies with palonosetron / netupitant (0, 3/1, 5/3, or 10/10 mg/kg), the main toxicities observed were reduced body weight gain in females at 10 mg/kg, prolonged st- and qt intervals at 10/10 mg/kg and increased liver weights that maintained in some animals until the end of the recovery period (10 mg/kg).
</p>
<p>
the noael concluded for this study was 5/3 mg/kg palonosetron/ netupitant. studies submitted for palonosetron to assess the repeated dose toxicity in mice used the oral route. the applicant’s justification for performing oral studies to mimic the exposure profile during intravenous
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 28/153 administration in humans was considered acceptable. the chmp assumes that, with the intended clinical human exposure being a single i.v. injection (the intended clinical i.v. dose of palenosetron (0.25mg) equates to approximately 0.004 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult), and at a dose many multiples lower than the lowest animal i.v noael (7 mg/kg/day and 6 mg/kg/day for rat and dog, respectively), palenosetron, in the absence of drug interactions, is safe for the intended use in human.

genotoxicity
</header>
<p>
two ames bacterial cell reverse mutation assays were performed with netupitant.
</p>
<p>
owing to precipitation and toxicity observed, concentrations from 2 to 200 μg/plate (study no. 1004078) and from 5 to 500 μg/plate and 1 to 100 μg/plate for the plate incorporation and pre-incubation versions of the assay respectively (study no. 1006128) were tested.
</p>
<p>
even at these concentrations, toxic effects were visible at the upper concentrations, with variation depending on strain and presence or absence of metabolic activation. netupitant did not induce any dose related increased of the number of revertant colonies/plate in any of the five tester strains examined (salmonella typhimuriurn: ta1535, ta97, ta98, tal00 and ta102).
</p>
<p>
netupitant did not increase the mutant frequency in a mouse lymphoma assay in the absence (5.0 to 17.5 μg/ml (3 h treatment) and 1.0 to 7.0 μg/ml (24 h treatment)) or presence of metabolic activation (5.0 to 30.0 μg/ml (3 h treatment). no chromosome damage was detected in vivo in rat bone marrow micronucleus test at concentrations up to 1000 mg/kg. with palonosetron in vitro bacterial mutation and mammalian cell mutation studies were negative. a chromosome aberration study in chinese hamster ovary cells was positive without s9 mix at concentrations of 201μg/ml or more. a positive result with s9 mix at the highest concentration, 650μg/ml, was considered equivocal. an intravenous mouse micronucleus test at dosages up to 10mg/kg, and an intravenous rat liver unscheduled dna study at dosages up to 30mg/kg, were both negative. the highest dosages were close to established lethal dosages. treatment in the rat study was associated with clonic convulsions. based on toxicokinetic data from other studies, high exposures can be assumed.

carcinogenicity
</header>
<p>
no carcinogenicity studies were performed with netupitant which is considered acceptable given the short duration of treatment. two long-term studies assessed the carcinogenic potential of palonosetron in rat and mouse. although the oral gavage route was used in these studies, whereas bolus intravenous is the route of administration of the proposed indication, all dosages used were multiples of the proposed human dosage and comparison of auc0-24h values indicated large multiples, ranging from 136 to 1220-fold in males and from 61 to 706-fold in females. high doses applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice. the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because ofthe high doses employed and since palonosetron is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not considered relevant for clinical use.

reproduction toxicity
</header>
<p>
in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, higher numbers of foetuses with tarsal hyperflexion and/or pes adductus were reported in rats at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. these limb variations were not associated with alterations in skeletal or soft tissue parts and could be considered related to restricted movement in the uterus such as caused by loss of amniotic fluid or crowded uterine horns.
</p>
<p>
at the noael for both maternal and developmental endpoints, there was no safety margin (exposure ratio = 0.6).
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 29/153 in rabbits, litter parameters were unaffected except the slight decreases foetal body weight at 30 mg/kg/day. position anomalies of forelimbs and/or hindlimbs and forepaws were noted in dose-related manner. at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, these effects occurred at a higher incidence than in study and historical controls.
</p>
<p>
a treatment-related increase in the number of minimally/partially fused sternebrae was observed at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg (fetal incidence: 7.9% and 15.0%; litter incidence: 40% and 58.8%) in the pivotal study. this finding occurred at a higher incidence than in study and historical controls (fusion and/or abnormal shape of 2 or more sternebrae: 1.1%-8%), and is considered as a malformation in spite of the lack of reduction in inter-sternebral spaces. agenesis of accessory lung lobe was observed at a higher incidence at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (25%-29%) than in study controls (10%) or in historical controls. as regards historical control data, it is limited to 5 studies (the current study being excluded). the incidence of absent accessory lung lobe ranged from 0% to 23%, with incidence exceeding 15% in only one study (0%, 0%, 9%, 14%; 23%). overall, a treatment-related effect is considered given the increased incidence of this malformation in treated rabbits. palonosetron oral application to rats (one –month repeat-dose toxicity study in rat) was associed with degeneration of the seminferous epithelium, this was not observed in i.v. fertility studies, leading to the conclusion that this toxic effect might be due to metabolites. reproductive and developmental studies conducted were overall acceptable and the noaels were high enough to allow a reasonable assumption of safety in human. no treatment-related teratogenic effets were seen with palonosetron. maternal toxicity was the limiting factor in the embyo-foetal studies. overall the reproductive and developmental studies conducted were appropriate and the noaels were high enough to allow a reasonable assumption of safety in human. in accordance with “the guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinatons of medicinal products” (emea/chmp/swp/258498/2005), no embryo-foetal development studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are not required.

pivotal study toxicokinetics

<p>
in the 13 week study in rat, maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 426/553 and auc (0-24h) values were 2550/6070 h.ng.ml (male/females) on day 91 at the noael dose of 3 mg/kg/day. plasma concentrations of netupitant in male and female rats were similar although there was a tendency to higher plasma concentrations in female than in male rats. an accumulation of netupitant was observed throughout the study. a high exposure to the main metabolite m1 was observed with auc(0-24h) values of 14300/12500 h.ng/ml in male/female rats at the noael dose. in 26 week study in rat, maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 126/318 and auc (0-24h) values were 7150/11100 h.ng.ml (male/females) on at the noael dose of 1 mg/kg/day. an accumulation of netupitant and metabolites m1 in week 4 compared to week 1. a high exposure to the main metabolite m1 was observed with auc(0-24h) values of 14300/12500 h.ng/ml in male/female rats at the noael dose. palonosetron/netupitant combination treatment did not appear to have a significant effect on exposure to netupitant or metabolite m1 compared to netupitant alone. in the 13 week dog study maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 324/342 ng/ml and auc(0-24h) were 3520/3970 h.ng/ml (female/male) on day 87. slight to moderate accumulation was evident compared to day zero values. in all dosing groups there was a tendency for higher plasma concentrations of netupitant and all three metabolites in male than in female dogs. auc(0-24) was 5780/5740 h.ng/ml in males/females. there was a high accumulation of m1 with mean accumulation factors ranging from 2.2 to 2.9 in females and from 2.4 to 4.3 in males, and a dose proportional increase between 1 and 10 mg/kg. tk parameters for netupitant in the 3-month combination study was approximately similar to that in the 28-day combination therapy study in dogs, although auc levels in males apeared to be increased in 5p/3n males. in the 9 month study maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 466/417and auc (0-24h) values were 6280/5520 h.ng/ml (male/females) at the noael dose. cmax and auc increased generally in a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 1 to 3 mg/kg and from 3 to 10 mg/kg, with ratios for cmax ranging from 2.1-5.4 and 1.7-3.2 respectively. auc ratios were 2.2-4.8 and 2.2-4.2 respectively. cmax and auc increased generally in a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 1 to 3 mg/kg and from 3 to 10 mg/kg, with ratios for cmax ranging from 2.1-5.4 and 1.7-3.2 respectively. auc ratios were 2.2-4.8 and 2.2-4.2 respectively. auc values slightly increased over time in males and females at all dose levels. netupitant and its metabolites m1, m2 and m3 was similar in males and females, and showed dose proportional kinetics. netupitant accumulated slightly, in terms of auc, in both sexes at all dose levels.

local tolerance
</header>
<p>
in an intravenous local tolerance study in rabbits, marked local non-reversible reactions along with increased neutrophils and monocytes were noted at 10 mg/kg i.v. however, netupitant was considered non-irritating and non-sensitising to eye and skin of rabbits and albino guinea pigs.
</p>
<p>
the relevance of
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 33/153 these studies is limited owing to the proposed clinical oral indication. for palonosetron, no evidence of local tolerance toxicity was observed in the i.v. toxicology investigations. in accordance with “the guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinatons of medicinal products” (emea/chmp/swp/258498/2005), local tolerance studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are not required.
</p>

other toxicity studies
</header>
<p>
the possible phototoxic potential of netupitant was examined in vitro by the 3t3 fibroblast neutral red uptake assay. netupitant absorbs uv light between 240 and 380 nm. murine fibroblasts were incubated for 1 h with 0.75-96.0 μg/ml netupitant in the presence of uva exposure and in the dark. under these experimental conditions netupitant was considered to be non-phototoxic. neputipant was not antigenic in male guinea pigs tested for active systemic and for passive anaphylaxis (study no. 1007385; glp). neputipant did not appear to be phototoxic, irritating or sensitizing and was not antigenic.
</p>
<p>
the genotoxic potential of impurities was evaluated by sars analysis (derek). the results of this assessment were negative.
</p>
<p>
furthermore, the specified impurities 12-netu and 14-netu i10 were negative in an ames test in the absence or presence of s9 metabolism at concentrations up to 5000 μg/plate. given that an additional metabolite m4 was detected in clinical studies, the mutagenic potential of this metabolite was examined in an ames assay.
</p>
<p>
the m4 metabolite was considered to be non-mutagenic in the ames assay.
</p>
<p>
moreover, an ic50 of 66.6 µg/ml for the m4 metabolite was obtained in the in vitro cytotoxicity assay in balb/c 3t3 cells.
</p>
<p>
given that the m4 systemic exposure (auc) is 3% of netupitant systemic exposure, the results of the in vitro studies sufficiently characterise this metabolite. for palonosetron in vitro photo-cytotoxicity and photo-clastogenicity tests, and a photo-allergenicity investigation that included a preliminary single-dose photo-irritation study were conducted and no evidence of phototoxicity were observed. in accordance with “the guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinatons of medicinal products” (emea/chmp/swp/258498/2005), others toxicity studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are not required.

<p>
palonosetron pec surfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l and is not a pbt substance as log kow does not exceed 4.5. therefore, palonosetron is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. netupitant pec surfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l but log kow exceeds 4.5 as a result the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of netupitant to the environment.
</p>
<p>
the applicant has initiated a tiered risk assessment with regards to pbt in a stepwise manner:
</p>
<p>
step 1) oecd 301 ready biodegradability test; step 2) oecd 308 sediment-water transformation test; step 3) oecd 305 bioconcentration test with fish; step 4) oecd 201 (algae), 210 (fish early life stage) and 211 (daphnia reproduction). from work completed (oecd 301 ready biodegradability test), netupitant was not considered readily biodegradable.
</p>
<p>
in the context of the obligation of the mah to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the chmp recommends for further investigation: to conduct the remaining studies and submit the data upon finalisation.

</header>
<p>
in accordance with “the guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products” (emea/chmp/swp/258498/2005), the repeat-dose and dependance studies with combination netupitant / palonosetron were performed and no other studies are required. in the non-clinical studies the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological effects of netupitant alone and in combination with palonoestron have been sufficiently characterised. the pharmacodynamic studies provide sufficient proof of efficacy (antineoplastic-induced emesis in ferrets &amp; inhibition of nk1 agonist-induced foot-tapping in gerbils) for the individual actives alone as well as in combination with palonosetron.
</p>
<p>
interactions at the histamine (h2), adenosine (a3), da and 5-ht reuptake sites, l-type ca2+ channel and diltiazem binding site on the ca2+ channel were observed with netupitant.

however, taking into account the protein binding for both netupitant and palonosetron, the free plasma concentration of both drugs were well below the concentrations that are reported to affect binding sites at h2, a3 receptors, da, 5-ht reuptake and l-type and diltiazem binding sites, thus significant clinical interactions are not expected at therapeutic dose on these mechanism. in further binding studies, the netupitant main metabolites, m1 was shown to interact at the l-type ca2+ channel (ic50 = 2.8 μm; ki = 1.4 μm).
</p>
<p>
however, given the low systemic exposure to the m1 metabolite in human studies, the interaction of m1 with l-type ca2+ channel is unlikely to have any clinical implications.
</p>
<p>
this is further supported by the lack of any significant cardiovascular side effects observed in human studies. cardiovascular effects were observed in conscious dogs with netupitant and its main metabolite m1. since m1 has a major role in the qt prolongation and it is present in higher concentrations in dogs than in humans, the findings obtained in animals are not considered to be directly correlated to human cardiotoxicity.
</p>
<p>
this is further supported by the lack of significant changes of qt prolongation with netupitant alone and in combination with palonosetron in a thorough qt prolongation study (study no. netu-07-20) and in a phase i clinical studies in healthy volunteers (study no. np16603/1007847 &amp; np16601-1014020). for palonosetron, in rats changes were mainly detected in bone, kidney, testis, adrenal zona glomerulosa and spleen. the target organs in the dogs were thymus and liver. the chmp assumed that, with the intended clinical human exposure and at a dose many multiples lower than the lowest animal i.v noael was safe for the intended use in human. while the m3 metabolite had comparable pharmacological activity with respect to netupitant, the toxicity profile of the metabolite (outside of the well characterised cardiovascular effects) in the pivotal repeat-dose studies is unclear.
</p>
<p>
however, given that m3 auc concentrations in the 4 week dogs study following higher doses of netupitant were equivalent to the expected clinical exposure, and that patients will only receive a single dose prior to the chemotherapy cycle, it can be accepted that the lack of exposure in the pivotal toxicity studies does not pose a significant clinical safety risk. in vitro cyp450 inhibition studies indicated a potential for clinically relevant cyp3a4 interactions, with both netupitant and metabolite m1. a concentration dependent inhibition of cyp3a4-mediated docetaxel inhibition was also seen, with an ic50 of 3.7 um. the interaction is described in the smpc. induction of cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 or cyp3a4 was not seen in human hepatocytes. based on the cmax/ic50 ratio, interaction with bcrp is considered a possibility and is highlighted in section 4.5 of the smpc.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 36/153 at higher dose levels microscopic changes in various organs (liver (hepatocellular vacuolation), lungs (infiltration by foamy macrophages), spleen (histiocytosis), mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes (diffuse histiocytosis and histiocytic aggregates)) that were consistent with drug induced phospholipidosis were shown in rats and dogs.
</p>
<p>
these changes were completely or at least partially in the case of liver, lung and lymph nodes reversible after an 8 week recovery period.
</p>
<p>
furthermore, risk of phospholipidosis induction in humans was examined in a phase i clinical trial where peripheral lymphocytes were isolated and examined for the presence of lamellar bodies.
</p>
<p>
no evidence of drug-induced lamellar inclusion bodies was observed at doses up to 450 mg. no clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed in the completed phase i studies and review of adverse events (aes) from the completed phase iii studies showed that overall slightly higher proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron combination group had liver transaminases increased (aes in the investigations soc) in comparison to palonosetron group but none of these laboratory abnormalities was assessed as a serious ae. the toxicological significance of pld is still unclear in humans, but considering the evidence of toxicity and adverse functional changes in non-clinical studies “phospholipidosis” was included as an important potential risk in the rmp and in 5.3 of the smpc. alteration of hepatic structure and function has been observed in non-clinical studies. the review of adverse events from the phase iii studies showed that overall slightly higher proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron combination group had liver transaminases increased (aes in the investigations soc) in comparison to palonosetron group, with no impact on hepatic function. none of these laboratory abnormalities was assessed as a serious ae, but the applicant proposed to include “liver transaminases increase” as an important potential risk in 4.8 of the smpc and this was agreed by the chmp. administration of netupitant to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was shown to increase the incidence of some foetal malformations: limb and paw positional anomalies, minimal/partial fusion of sternebrae, and agenesis of accessory lung lobe. the noael for embryo-fetal development is 3 mg/kg/day.
</p>
<p>
taking into account the teratogen effect of netupitant in rabbit without a safety margin, a contraindication of akynzeo during pregnancy with a contraception measure for women of childbearing potential was included into the smpc. the applicant has initiated a tiered risk assessment with regards to pbt.
</p>
<p>
from work completed (oecd 301 ready biodegradability test), netupitant was not considered readily biodegradable.
</p>
<p>
the remaining studies are underway or are being planned. in the context of the obligation of the mah to take due account of technical and scientific progress full and final reports are recommended to be submitted when completed for final assessment.

2.3.7.  conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
</header>
<p>
the main toxicities observed during the non-clinical development of netupitant were in relation to phospholipidosis and qt prolongation.
</p>
<p>
these toxicities were partially if not fully reversible upon cessation of treatment.
</p>
<p>
moreover, the toxicities appear to be related to continued administration and to the abundance of the m1 metabolite both in the rat and dogs.
</p>
<p>
lamellar inclusion bodies (biomarker of phospholipidosis) after single and multiple administration doses of netupitant up to 450 mg were not detected in humans while no significant changes of qt prolongation were seen in the tqt study in healthy volunteers. appropriate information was included in section 5.3 of the product information. in view of a number of foetoxic findings observed in the rabbit reprotoxicity studies’, a teratogenic risk of the fdc is probable. alternative treatment options are available in this indication. therefore akynzeo has been contraindicated in pregnant women and it is advised in the smpc that women of childbearing
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 37/153 potential must use effective contraception during therapy. the smpc of akynzeo in section 5.3 summarizes the foetotoxic effects seen in animal studies seen with netupitant and in combination with palonosetron such as an increased number of minimally/partially fused sternebrae, cleft palate, microphthalmia and aphakia and lobular agenesis of the lung. overall, the non-clinical data for the fdc are considered appropriate to support the proposed indication.

<p>
as the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron are already well characterised, this section will focus predominantly on the pharmacokinetics of netupitant. more than one fixed dose formulation of the fixed dose formulations has been investigated in pk studies as well as extemporaneous combinations of palonsetron and netupitant which were used in the earlier pk studies. overall 23 pk studies were submitted in the dossier including five bioequivalent studies. proposed analytical methods were adequate and had been satisfactorily validated.

absorption • bioavailability
</header>
<p>
netupitant bioequivalence studies were presented to investigate the pk of the formulation to be used commercially. absolute bioavailability studies with the palonseteron/netupitant combination were not carried out in humans. based on two studies with iv netupitant (bp17085 and netu-11-01) the oral bioavailability in humans was greater than 60%. a number of studies were undertaken which enable the characterisation of the extent of absorption in healthy volunteers (netu-11-23, netu-08-12, netu-09-07 and netu-11-02). overall measurable plasma netupitant concentrations were detected between 15 minutes and 3 hours after dosing in single dose oral studies. after this lag time, plasma concentrations followed a first order absorption process and reached cmax in approximately 4-5 hours. netupitant is eliminated from the body in a multi-exponential fashion, with an apparent mean elimination half-life ranging from 30 to approximately 100 hours (across all studies for doses of 30 mg to 450 mg) with a few longer outliers. palonosetron after single oral doses using buffered solution mean maximum palonosetron concentrations (cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (auc0-∞) were dose proportional over the dose range of 3.0 to 80 μg/kg in healthy subjects.
</p>
<p>
in 36 healthy male and female subjects given a single oral dose of 500 mcg palonosetron, maximum plasma palonosetron concentration (cmax) was 0.81 ± 1.66 ng/ml (mean ± sd) and time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 5.1 ± 1.7 hours. in female subjects (n=18), the mean auc was 35% higher and the mean cmax was 26% higher than in male subjects (n=18). in 12 cancer patients given a single oral dose of palonosetron 500 mcg one hour prior to chemotherapy, cmax was 0.93 ± 0.34 ng/ml and tmax was 5.1 ± 5.9 hours. the auc was 30% higher in cancer patients than in healthy subjects.

<p>
the influence of food was investigated in two pk studies an older study conducted by roche in 2002 (np16600d) and a more recent one conducted by helsinn birex in 2010 (netu-10-12).
</p>
<p>
np 16600 was an open labelled randomised cross over study with 12 healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years of age) who

received a single oral dose of 300mg ro-67 3189 (netupitant) on two occasions under fasting and fed conditions. there was a minimum of a two week washout period between

blood samples for pk assessment were taken pre-dose, 15 minutes and 45 minutes post-dose and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours post-dose. one subject was withdrawn from the study. following oral administration of 300 mg of the study drug, the plasma concentration of ro0673189 increased in a first order fashion. the relative exposure and 95% confidence intervals for treatment under fed conditions compared to fasting treatment were determined based on the results from anova on log-transformed parameters. the plasma exposure, judged by peak plasma concentration and auc of the parent compound, increased by between 69% (cmax) and 47% (auclast), in the fed compared to the fasted state. amongst healthy subjects, the impact of food on the bioavailability of ro0673189 ranged from no effect to &gt; 3-fold increase.

</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 48/153 tissues following single or multiple (7 days) oral dosing in the rat. the drug is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99%) with apparently no large differences in free fraction between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic failure.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron at the recommended doses is widely distributed in the body (volume of distribution of approximately 8.3±2.5 l/kg) and approximately 62% is found as bound to human-plasma proteins. • distribution in cancer chemotherapy patients data on distribution in cancer chemotherapy patients comes from the a population pk analysis (netu-10-02), performed in association with the phase 3 study netu-08-18.
</p>
<p>
netupitant disposition was characterized by a 2-compartment model with an estimated median systemic cl of 20.5 l/h and a large volume of the central (486 l) and peripheral compartments (1170 l), respectively. these estimates for cl and volume indicated that the drug was extensively distributed in body tissues and the plasma elimination was rapid.

elimination • excretion
</header>
<p>
netupitant is primarily excreted via hepatic/biliary routes, with renal clearance (clr) accounting for less than 5% of cl. in early studies, 3 active metabolites were identified (m1, m2 and m3). in plasma from humans who were administered oral netupitant, netupitant and its 3 major metabolites were extensively bound (&gt; 97%) to plasma protein at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1500 ng/ml. in an open label label, single dose study (netu-09-21) in 6 healthy males designed to assess the mass balance recovery, pk, metabolic profile and metabolic identification of 300mg [14c]-netupitant, approximately half the administered dose of radioactivity was recovered within 120 h of dosing. however, for all subjects, insufficient radioactivity data (ie &lt;90%) was recovered by 336 h. therefore, subjects were required to collect faeces samples for a 24 h period (456 to 480 h) at home, and both faeces and urine samples for an additional 24 h period (672 to 696 h) in the clinic. based on the total radioactivity recovered in all samples, including the additional collection periods, total radioactivity from the urine accounted for 3.95% (range 2.2% to 4.6%) of the dose and total radioactivity from the faeces accounted for 70.7% (range 62.1% to 75.2%) of the dose at 696 h post-dose. these data indicate that the hepatic/biliary route, rather than renal clearance, is the major elimination route for drug-related entities. the mean recovery from subjects after the second additional 24 h collection was subsequently estimated to be approximately 90% (based on the assumption that the excretion was proceeding at a steadily decreasing rate). including the extrapolated values for the periods 336 to 456 h and 480 to 672 h, the total drug-related material to have been excreted by 696 h post-dose via the faeces was estimated to be 86.49%; a mean of 4.75% of drug-related material was estimated to have been excreted in the urine for the same time period. palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites. following administration of a single oral 0.75 mg dose of [14c] palonosetron to six healthy subjects, 85% to 93% of the total radioactivity was excreted in urine, and 5% to 8% was eliminated in faeces. the amount of unchanged palonosetron excreted in the urine represented approximately 40% of the administered dose. in healthy subjects given palonosetron capsules 500 mcg, the terminal elimination half-life (t½) of palonosetron

ema/236963/2015 page 49/153 was 37 ± 12 hours (mean ± sd), and in cancer patients, t½ was 48 ± 19 hours. after a single dose of approximately 0.75 mg intravenous palonosetron, the total body clearance of palonosetron in healthy subjects was 160 ± 35 ml/h/kg (mean ± sd) and renal clearance was 66.5± 18.2 ml/h/kg.

• metabolism
</header>
<p>
four metabolites have been detected in human plasma at netupitant doses of 30 mg and higher (m1, m2, m3 and m4). m1, m2 and m3 are considered major metabolites. m4 was identified as a minor metabolite (&lt; 10% exposure of the parent) late in the development process in study netu-09-21. in netu-09-21 netupitant was shown to undergo extensive metabolism, forming both phase i and phase ii metabolites. phase i metabolites observed included those formed through n-demethylation (mono and bis), mono and di-hydroxylation, n-oxidation, desaturation, n-formylation, oxidation and reduction to a keto group, and oxidation to an acid (including oxidation of the toluene methyl group to an acid). intermediate metabolites in the 1-methylpiperazine degradation pathway to the further oxidised 6-amino-pyridinyl derivatives were also observed. phase ii metabolites included those formed by glucuronidation and conjugation to a hexose (c6 sugar) group. a glucuronic acid conjugate of the acid-half molecule of netupitant was also observed in urine.
</p>
<p>
analysis of the plasma samples for the metabolites m1, m2, and m3 indicated that based on the auc0-t values, metabolites m1, m2 and m3 represented 9.8%, 4.8% and 11.3% of the total radioactivity exposure and netupitant represented 34.0% of the total radioactivity exposure. exposure to m1, m2 and m3 as a percentage of netupitant exposure (based on auc0-t values) was approximately 29%, 14% and 33%, respectively.
</p>
<p>
these results confirm that m1, m2, and m3 are all major metabolites of netupitant and account for &gt;10% of parent drug exposure. a fourth metabolite, m4 (n-oxide, n-demethyl derivative, see
</p>
<p>
figure 10) was discovered during this study, having a peak at the same location as the parent. m4 had a cmax &lt;7% of the parent. (m4 pk parameters were confirmed in study netu-11-23, showing a systemic exposure of approximately 3% compared to the parent). m1, m2 and m3 were all shown to be pharmacologically active in in a gerbil foot tapping nk1 assay. m3 was the most potent and m2 the least active. • pharmacokinetics of metabolites pharmacokinetic data for metabolites from study np16603 are shown in table 14. additional data for

• consequences of possible genetic polymorphism
</header>
<p>
netupitant is primarily metabolized via hepatic cytochrome p450 3a4.
</p>
<p>
in general, genetic polymorphism of cyp3a4 results in a decrease in enzyme activity, but occurs in a small proportion of the population across all of the affected alleles and are not expected to lead to clinical relevant increase in netupitant exposure. specific studies to evaluate effect of genetic polymorphism of cyp3a4 on netupitant disposition were not conducted. palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: n-oxide-palonosetron m9 and 6-hydroxy-palonosetron m4. these metabolites each have less
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 51/153 than 1% of the 5-ht3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. the n-oxide metabolite m9 (08-palo-d1), accounted for approximately 13% of the iv and oral dose, and metabolite m4 (08-palo-m4), represented approximately 11% of the dose after iv administration and approximately 17% after oral administration. in vitro metabolism studies have suggested that cyp2d6 and to a lesser extent, cyp3a4 and cyp1a2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. however, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of cyp2d6 substrates (palo-99-39). moreover, in vitro testing indicated that palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome p450 isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations. palonosetron is almost exclusively metabolised by cytochrome p450, primarily via cyp2d6 and, to a lesser extent, by cyp3a and cyp1a2. small amounts of m9 were present in the plasma relative to the parent compound in all studies. exposure, as measured by auc, to m9 was generally less than 10% after both oral and iv administration in healthy volunteers and cinv patients. plasma concentrations of palonosetron generally increased with increasing doses, similar to what was observed with iv dosing. dose proportionality of m9 was generally observed. exposure to m4 was measured in cancer patients. at 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg dose of palonosetron, when m4 concentrations were measurable, there was high variability between patients. overall mean exposure ranged from 9-16% compared to the parent.

a double-blind placebo controlled single ascending oral dose study (np16603) was conducted in 2003
</p>
<p>
to assess the tolerability, safety, pk, and pd of netupitant (ro0673189)after single oral ascending doses in healthy male volunteers. five dose levels were investigated 10, 30, 100, 300 and 450. for each dose group four subjects were randomly assigned to netupitant and 2 to placebo. blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and at 15 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h post-dose.
</p>
<p>
following a lag time of up to 3 hours, netupitant was absorbed in a first-order fashion, with cmax being reached at approximately 5 hours post-dose (see table 4). for doses up to 300 mg, there was a statistically significant over-proportional increase with dose in cmax, auclast and auc0-∞ for netupitant. dose-proportionality was observed between the 300 mg and 450 mg doses, with ratios being close to one. ro0673189 (netupitant) showed a statistically significant over-proportional increase with dose for cmax (p=0.0001), auclast (p=0.0002) and aucinf (p&lt;0.0001) for doses up to 300 mg. the measures of deviation from dose-proportionality between the 100 mg and 300 mg doses are 1.48, 1.77 and 1.75 respectively for cmax, aucinf and auclast. for the 300 mg and 450 mg doses, the increase in exposure appears to be dose-proportional, with ratios for cmax, auclast and aucinf all being close to one. metabolites ro0681133 (m1), ro0713001 (m2) and ro0731519 (m3) were measured in plasma for the 30mg doses of netupitant upwards. exposure to metabolites was considerably lower than to parent compound, with cmax values of one tenth to one fifth of parent levels and auc values between one twentieth and one third of the parent compound.
</p>
<p>
metabolite ro0681133 (m1), was dose proportional for cmaxbut not auclast. the increase in auclast was over proportional for doses from 10mg to 300mg but not from 300 mg to 450 mg.
</p>
<p>
for ro0713001 (m2), none of the parameters showed a statistically significant deviation from dose-proportionality. for ro0731519 (m3) there was an over-proportional increase in auclast but a dose proportional increase in cmaxwith increasing doses of netupitant.

<p>
a fed study (np16601) was undertaken to assess the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of netupitant following one week daily oral dosing in ascending fashion in healthy volunteers. the study also included 3 elderly volunteers, however only two completed the study. results are presented for the non-elderly population only as a full plasma concentration profile was only available for one elderly person.. exposure to netupitant showed a slightly greater than proportional increase with dose. for day 1, there was statistically significant evidence against dose proportionality for auc(0-23.5) and cmax. after 7 doses, there was statistically significant evidence against dose proportionality for auc(0-23.5) but for cmax the results were of borderline significance (p=0.062). for both parameters, the results for the 300 mg and 450 mg doses were higher on days 1 and 7 than would be expected if dose proportionality held. in keeping with its long estimated half-life, these data showed increase in netupitant exposure of approximately 3-fold after 7 days’ dosing. results of the anova confirmed that the accumulation of netupitant by day 7 was statistically significant for both auc(0-23.5) and cmax. overall the pk data showed an increase in netupitant exposure of approximately 3-fold after 7 days of dosing. this is consistent with the long t1/2 of the compound. mean maximum plasma concentrations and auc (0-23.5) values recorded on days 1 and 7 of dosing with 100, 300 or 450 mg of netupitant are shown in table 17. exposure netupitant showed a slightly greater than proportional increase with dose. the small magnitude of this effect is considered unlikely to have any clinical relevance.

palonosetron in study palo-02-12, the pk profile of palonosetron was studied after iv administration of 0.25 mg daily doses for 3 consecutive days. a 2-fold increase in systemic exposure was estimated on day 3 as compared to day 1, which is consistent with the long plasma elimination half-life of palonosetron. the main pk parameters for palonosetron are summarized in the following table.

netupitant no clear patterns between inter-individual variability and dose emerged e.g. cv% for the 30mg single dose in np 16603 was 55.83% and for the 300mg dose was 24.9%. in np16601 cv% for the 300mg dose on day 1 was 26.5% similar to that for np16603 (these were both fed studies). inter-individual variation appeared to be higher in fasted studies (49.05% in those in the fasted study of np16600 and 41.9% in those in the fasted study in netu-10-12). inter-subject variability was higher for those in the hepatic impairment pk trial from 54.8, 55.2 and 63.8% respectively for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment respectively (netu-10-10), in some interaction studies e.g netupitant and etoposide (49.05%) and in the elderly (netu-10-12) where inter-subject variability was 54.4%. the inter subject variability of palonosetron was lower, with a variability of 20 to 29%.

pharmacokinetics in target population • pk in cancer patients
</header>
<p>
the pk of netupitant and its metabolites were evaluated in a drug interaction study (netu-10-09) and population pk study netu-10-02 (performed in association with the phase 3 study netu-08-18.
</p>
<p>
in study netu-10-09, male and female cancer patients were treated with the netupitant/palonosetron fdc and docetaxel, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents, provided they were not inhibitors, inducers or substrates of cyp3a4. overall, exposure to netupitant and its metabolites in terms of cmax, auc0-t and auc0-∞ values were consistent with previous data reported in healthy subjects and generally appeared to be independent of the chemotherapeutic regimen administered. variability was high (50 to 70%) for cmax and moderate for other parameters. mean t1/2 ranged from approximately 70 h to 90 h, consistent with the known profile of netupitant, and were not different across the 3 treatment groups. exposure to netupitant metabolite m1 and m3 relative to netupitant was 8 to 14% for cmax and approximately 30 to 35% for auc0-t. exposure to netupitant metabolite m2 relative to netupitant ranged from approximately 45 to 70% for cmax and from 20 to 30% for auc0-t. these data are also consistent with previous data in healthy subjects. overall, mean pk parameters of palonosetron in cancer patients from study netu-10-09 with the fdc were consistent with its known pk profile and support previous studies in both healthy volunteers and cancer patients. mean palonosetron pk variables from this study indicated a slightly higher exposure (cmax and auc0-∞) and longer t1/2 in patients receiving docetaxel, compared to etoposide or cyclophosphamide, with moderate variability. in the population pk analysis (netu-10-02), netupitant disposition was characterized by a 2-compartment model with an estimated median systemic cl of 20.5 l/h and a large volume of the central (486 l) and peripheral compartments (1170 l), respectively. these estimates for cl and volume indicated that the drug was extensively distributed in body tissues and the plasma elimination was rapid. based on the pk model parameter estimates, the median t1/2 for netupitant was calculated as 88 hours. none of the covariates (body mass index [bmi], age, gender, race, chemotherapy regimen, rescue medication, smoking status, doxorubicin, epirubicin and flororuacil, alanine aminotransferase [alt], aspartate aminotransferase [ast], alkaline phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, eastern cooperative oncology group [ecog]status and neutrophil count) had a significant impact on the disposition of netupitant. metabolites m1 and m3 showed a large vd and a slower elimination compared to the parent compound (cl accounted for 20% and 30% of the parent, respectively). a 3-compartment model was used to describe the concentration data of m2 due to the multiple exponential decay and flat elimination phase. the estimated parameters indicated that cl (1.24 l/hr) was approximately 6% of the parent. palonosetron estimates
</p>
<p>
from the population pk analysis (netu-10-02)were consistent with a previous analysis with regard to cl and vd (median palonosetron cl was estimated to be 7.61 l/h; estimated median volume of the central compartment was 367 l). palonosetron cl was influenced by creatinine clearance but this reduction (approximately 29%) would not result in a significant change in palonosetron exposure and would not necessitate a dosing reduction.

<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 57/153 no specific studies were performed to evaluate netupitant in patients with renal impairment. in the adme trial, less than 5% of all drug-related material was excreted in urine (netu-09-21) and less than 1% of the netupitant dose was eliminated unchanged in the urine (netu-06-27) and therefore any accumulation of netupitant or metabolites after a single dose would be negligible. the population pk study showed no correlation between pk parameters of netupitant and markers of renal dysfunction. in this study, patients with a reduced creatinine clearance (clcr) also had a reduced palonosetron cl, but this reduction would not result in a significant change in palonosetron exposure (netu-10-02).

<p>
total palonosetron exposure was also increased in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy subjects. in study netu-10-10 exposure to palonosetron (cmax, auc0-t and auc0-∞) compared to matched healthy subjects was 14%, 35% and 33% higher in mild and 1% lower, 60% and 62% higher in moderate hepatically-impaired subjects, respectively. a numerical decrease of palonosetron exposure was observed in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to matching healthy subjects, which was not statistically significant.

<p>
a pooled analysis using data from 3 phase 1 single-dose studies (netu-11-02, netu-09-07 and netu-11-23) in 153 healthy subjects was performed to evaluate a possible gender effect with netupitant and palonosetron (nepa-13-11). a gender effect for palonosetron had previously been established, and data from the current analysis confirm that exposure (geometric mean) is higher (40% for auc0-t, 31% for cmax) in females. palonosetron t1/2 is also longer in females by approximately 16%. the clinical implications of the gender findings for palonosetron are of limited significance, as the safety margin is large (doses have been administered and well tolerated up through 12-fold the proposed oral dose) and the dose-response relationship has not been demonstrated to be closely linked to plasma concentrations, and as such, a difference in the range observed would not impact efficacy. for netupitant, females also had a higher exposure (geometric mean); there was a 35% increase for cmax, a 2% increase for auc0-t and a 36% increase in t1/2 in females compared to males. for netupitant, these increases in exposure are not considered to be clinically relevant. the tmax did not differ between the genders for netupitant and palonosetron. furthermore, in the population pk study, gender as a covariate did not influence the pk of netupitant, it`s metabolites, or palonosetron. a gender effect for palonosetron had previously been established during the development program, showing a 1.20-1.30 fold increase in exposure for females compared to males. in the pooled data from nepa-13-11, mean palonosetron cmax was approximately 1.30 fold higher and auc was approximately 1.40 fold higher in females. t1/2 also was slightly longer (44 versus 37 hours), while tmax was not different between males and females (nepa-13-11). the population pk evaluation did not reveal gender as a significant covariate affecting the disposition of palonosetron in patients participating in netu-08-18, however the number of males participating was small (netu-10-02).

<p>
the effect of weight on exposure was investigated in a population pk study (study netu-10-02)). neither body weight or bmi had a significant impact on the pk of netupitant. body weight was found to contribute to inter-individual variability in v2 for palonosetron. palonosetron has a large vd with an estimated median v2 of 367 l for patients of median weight (71 kg), comparable to that observed in previous studies, indicative of extensive tissue distribution. over the weight range observed for patients in this study (34 kg to 125 kg), v2 is calculated to vary from 257 l to 527 l. these results are consistent with a previously conducted population pk analysis for palonosetron.

• in vitro the metabolism of netupitant has been studied in vitro in human, rat and dog hepatocyte incubations, microsomal incubations of human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver, as well as with specific recombinant human cytochrome p450 (cyp450) isoenzymes.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 60/153 human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver microsomal incubations showed qualitatively similar metabolite patterns. the similarity in overall metabolism was confirmed by metabolite patterns from human, rat and dog hepatocyte incubations.
</p>
<p>
netupitant is metabolized by cyp3a4 to several metabolites. three major oxidative metabolites of netupitant have been identified after hepatocytes and liver microsomal incubations: m1 (ro0681133, a desmethyl derivative), m2 (ro0713001, a n-oxide derivative) and m3 (ro0731519, a oh-methyl derivative). cyp3a4, the major human liver cyp450 isoenzyme, catalyzed the oxidative metabolism of netupitant (but not cyp2c9, cyp2d6 or cyp2c19). this isoenzyme is known to exhibit considerable variability (approximately 10 fold) in the human population. it is also inducible, and can be inhibited by other drugs, indicating the potential for variability in the clearance of netupitant and for drug-drug interactions. in human liver microsomes, netupitant competitively inhibited the cyp3a4 mediated hydroxylation of testosterone and midazolam (apparent ki of 1.1 and 2.2 μm, respectively). therefore, interactions of netupitant with drugs mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 cannot be excluded. additionally, the drug-drug interaction potential of metabolite m1 and metabolite m2 was investigated in vitro. m1 metabolite showed an inhibition potential similar to that of the parent drug (ic50 ~1.2 μm). for the hydroxylation of diclofenac, catalyzed by cyp2c9, the ic50 value of netupitant was approximately 20 μm. based on the low plasma concentration of netupitant expected in man, significant metabolic interactions with cyp2c9 metabolized drugs are considered unlikely. other cyp450 isoenzymes (cyp1a2, cyp2c19, cyp2d6) were not inhibited by netupitant (ic50 &gt; 100 μm) (report 1003907). from in vitro drug-drug-interaction studies focused on the inhibitory effect of netupitant on vincristine and cyclophosphamide metabolism in human liver microsomes, significant drug-drug interaction effects are not expected in humans in both cases (cmax/ki&lt;0.1 indicated a remote possibility of in vivo drug-drug interaction) (netu-06-15, netu-09-10). on the contrary drug-drug interaction effects are possible in humans when netupitant is co-administered with docetaxel: the ic50 value of netupitant in human liver microsomes was 3.7 μm when docetaxel was used as a substrate. an estimation of the cmax/ki ratio is approximately 0.5 (netu-09-09). as presented below, a clinical study evaluating docetaxel was performed. based on the results of in-vitro studies with p-glycoprotein (pgp), netupitant at 5 μm, modulates the papp of 3h-digoxin in both directions in a similar fashion to verapamil. considering the low plasma concentration of netupitant expected in human plasma, significant metabolic interactions with pgp transported drugs are considered possible only for supra-therapeutic doses (netu-06-13). a clinical study with digoxin was performed for in vivo confirmation. netupitant at concentrations of 0.2, 2 and 20 μm and m1, m2 and m3 at concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 μm did not induce cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 or cyp3a4 activity in human hepatocytes (netu-10-27). in vivo drug-drug interaction between netupitant and drugs that are substrates of bcrp is considered possible because cmax/ic50 ratio, calculated with cmax (bound+unboud) in the range 0.73-1.3 μm ) and the ic50 determined in vesicular transfer inhibition assay, ranged between 0.12 and 0.21. however this result should be handled with caution, as the ic50 value could not be determined in mdckii-bcrp inhibition assay due to the solubility limitation of 30 μm. besides, at 10 μm there was no inhibition of the bcrp-mediated prazosin transport (netu-12-81). in vivo interaction of netupitant with human bsep, mrp2 efflux transporters and with human oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oat1, oat3, oct1 and oct2 uptake transporters, are predicted to be unlikely.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 61/153 based on the circulating cmax concentrations (bound + unbound) of netupitant metabolites (ranging from 0.07-0.11 μm, 0.17-0.35 μm and 0.07-0.16 μm for m1, m2 and m3, respectively) an in vivo interaction with all the transporters tested is predicted to be unlikely (netu-12-81).
</p>
<p>
in summary, netupitant is metabolized mainly by cyp3a4, is a moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4 and a weak inhibitor of all other transport mechanisms evaluated. in vitro metabolism studies for palonosetron have suggested that cyp2d6 and to a lesser extent, cyp3a4 and cyp1a2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. however, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of cyp2d6 substrates. there have been no in vitro animal studies or any in vivo studies of enzyme induction. there were no findings suggesting enzyme induction in any of the investigations.
</p>
<p>
at high concentrations in vitro, palonosetron was a competitive inhibitor of some cytochrome isoforms but this is not considered likely to be clinically relevant. the moderate extent of plasma protein binding suggests that small changes will have no influence on palonosetron availability. the absence of any evidence of enzyme induction and the fact that inhibition was only apparent at high concentrations in vitro suggests that interactions mediated by metabolic enzymes are unlikely. potential pharmacokinetic interactions have not otherwise been investigated.

<p>
a number of interaction studies were conducted with netupitant including: the following cancer drugs (docetaxel, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide); palonosetron; cyp3a4 substrates (erythromycin, midazolam, dexamethasone); cvp3a4 inhibitors and inducers (ketoconazole, rifampicin); and p-gp substrates (digoxin) cyp3a4 substrates
</p>
<p>
model cyp3a4 substrates erythromycin and midazolam were evaluated when administered concomitantly with netupitant alone (np16599). in this study, the pharmacokinetics of netupitant were not altered in the presence of erythromycin or midazolam. however, exposure of both substrates was increased (cmax and auc were approximately 30% higher for erythromycin while cmax and auc were 40% and 144% higher for midazolam).
</p>
<p>
in addition, co-administration of the netupitant/palonosetron fdc with the cyp3a4 substrates ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, was evaluated in women as part of an oral contraceptive regimen (netu-10-08). although the analysis of the effect of the oral contraceptives on netupitant was not part of the study objectives, the data were reviewed with netupitant pk values from earlier studies (netu-10-12; netu-10-11; netu-09-07; netu-11-02), and indicated that there was no apparent effect of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel on netupitant.
</p>
<p>
the netupitant/palonosetron fdc had no effect on cmax and exposure (auc0-∞) of ethinylestradiol. the 90% ci for auc0-t (126.8%) fell just outside the upper limit of bioequivalence criteria indicating a slightly higher systemic exposure after the combination compared to ethinylestradiol alone. for the levonorgesterel component, there was no effect of the fdc on levonorgestrel cmax, while exposure parameters (auc0-∞ and auc0-t) were increased by approximately 40%, and the 90% cis were outside bioequivalence range.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 62/153 dexamethasone
</p>
<p>
dexamethasone is administered as a part of many chemotherapy regimens either to prevent nausea and vomiting or to prevent allergic reactions with medications such as taxotere. in addition, dexamethasone is a known cyp3a4 substrate. a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of netupitant (at three different doses) on dexamethasone, using a dexamethasone regimen similar to that used in some antiemetic regimens for the prevention of cinv (netu-06-07).
</p>
<p>
the mean plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were higher when dexamethasone was co-administered with netupitant. the increase appeared to be dependent on netupitant exposure. auc0-24 was increased 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8 fold with co-administration of 100, 300 and 450 mg, respectively. exposure increased further after multiple doses: auc84-∞ was 1.7, 2.4 and 2.7-fold higher, respectively, after co-administration with netupitant. cyp3a4 inhibitors and inducers
</p>
<p>
administration of the cyp3a4 inhibitor ketoconazole with netupitant/palonosetron fdc increased the exposure of netupitant and resulted in a cmax of 1.3 fold, auc0-∞ of 2.4 fold and auc0-tz of 1.8 fold, when compared to the administration of netupitant/palonosetron fdc alone. the formation of m1 and m3 was also affected when netupitant was co-administered with ketoconazole compared to the intake of netupitant alone. cmax and auc0-tz were lower for all three metabolites after co-administration of ketoconazole. ketoconazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron (netu-10-11).
</p>
<p>
administration of the cyp3a4 inducer rifampicin with netupitant/palonosetron fdc alone decreased the exposure of netupitant. cmax, auc0-∞ and auc0-tz 2.6, 5.9, and 5.5 fold, respectively. co-administration of rifampicin resulted in a non significant decrease in palonosetron exposure (netu-10-11). because in vitro studies showed that netupitant interacted with p-gp resulting in a concentration-dependent modulation of 3h-digoxin transport, a clinical study was conducted to test the clinical relevance of the in vitro observations. the pk of digoxin was similar in the presence and absence of netupitant in healthy volunteers (netu-07-01).
</p>
<p>
considering overall the in vitro interaction studies of netupitant and its three metabolites (m1, m2 and m3) with human bsep, mrp2 and mdr1 efflux transporters and with human oatp1b1, oatp1b3, oat1, oat3, oct1 and oct2 uptake transporters, in vivo drug-drug interactions are predicted to be unlikely.
</p>
<p>
netupitant in vivo drug-drug interaction with bcrp might be considered possible because cmax/ic50 ratio, calculated with the ic50 determined in vt assay, ranges between 0.12 and 0.2. the ic50 value could not be determined in mdckii-bcrp inhibition assay due to the solubility limitation of 30 μm and that at 10 μm there was not inhibition of the bcrp-mediated prazosin transport (netu-12-81). agents prescribed together or likely to be coadministered
</p>
<p>
palonosetron since netupitant and palonosetron are to be co-administered in the fdc, the possible pk interaction between the highest doses used in phase 2 trials was evaluated in a pk study (netupitant 450 mg and palonosetron 0.75 mg) (netu-06-27). the study showed that there was no effect of palonosetron on netupitant exposure and although palonosetron cmax was slightly higher in the presence of netupitant, no significant effect of netupitant on palonosetron exposure was demonstrated.
</p>
<p>
chemotherapy agents
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 63/153 study netu-10-09 evaluated the pharmacokinetics of 3 common chemotherapy agents (docetaxel, etoposide and cyclophosphamide) likely to be used in conjunction with the netupitant/palonosetron fdc; docetaxel and etoposide are also known cyp3a4 substrates while cyclophosphamide is metabolized by a number of cyp enzymes, including 3a4.
</p>
<p>
the study showed that concentrations of docetaxel and to a lesser extent, etoposide, were consistently elevated in patients who received the fdc compared to those who received palonosetron only. mean exposure (auc0-t) increases were 37% and 21% for docetaxel and etoposide, respectively, in the netupitant test period. cyclophosphamide concentrations were not consistently affected and showed wide variability. although concentrations of chemotherapy were elevated following netupitant administration, ae profiles were not different in the two study groups, indicating that there was no clinical impact of the higher chemotherapy concentrations in these patients.

there were no differences in the disposition of netupitant or its metabolites with any of the chemotherapeutic agents. pk parameters were consistent with previous values observed in healthy volunteer trials. palonosetron mean exposure (auc0-∞) was higher (65%) and the mean half-life was 20 h longer in the docetaxel group compared to the etoposide and cyclophosphamide groups. no dose adjustment is necessary, given the large safety margin for palonosetron.
</p>
<p>
in addition, the population pk analysis evaluated doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil and rescue medication as potential covariates that could influence the disposition of netupitant and/or palonosetron. in this population, none were found to have a significant effect on the disposition of netupitant or palonosetron (netu-10-02). other moderately emetogenic chemotherapy agents that are metabolised by cyp3a4 were not investigated for their potential to interact with netupitant e.g. vinorelbine, irinotecan, and imatinib.

three specific pharmacodynamic studies were part of this product development program. two studies evaluated netupitant alone, and the third (thorough qt/qtc study) evaluated the netupitant-palonosetron fdc. in addition, a phase 2 study, netu-07-07 lead to the choice of the 300 mg netupitant dose for phase 3 and a population pk/pd analysis was performed in conjunction with study netu-08-18 (netu-10-02).

mechanism of action
</header>
<p>
netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance p/neurokinin 1 (nk1) receptors.
</p>
<p>
palonosetron is a 5-ht3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. chemotherapeutic substances produce nausea and vomiting by stimulating the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. serotonin then activates 5-ht3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. the development of acute emesis is known to depend on serotonin and its 5-ht3 receptors have been demonstrated to selectively stimulate the emetic response.
</p>
<p>
delayed emesis has been largely associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (nk1) receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance p. as shown in in vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance p mediated responses.

np16602: apomorphine challenge in healthy volunteers was undertaken as a pharmacodynamic efficacy study. this was a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the anti-emetic effect of netupitant following an apomorphine challenge in healthy volunteers in which 32 subjects were randomly to 4 dosing groups (within each group 6 subjects received netupitant and 2 placebo). another study in healthy volunteers (netu-06-08) was undertaken to assess the degree of neurokinin-1 receptor occupancy in the human brain after a single dose of netupitant in healthy male subjects.

emesis occurring during the 90-minute period following apomorphine injection was evaluated by the degree of nausea, measured at 10 minute intervals using a visual analogue scale, the occurrence of vomiting and the total number of vomits and retches.
</p>
<p>
blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and at 15 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h post-dose. blood and urine samples for laboratory safety tests were taken at screening, pre-dose, at 24, 72 and 168 h post-dose, and at follow-up (day 9-15). vital signs were recorded at screening, pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 129, 144 and 168 h post-dose, and at follow-up. 12-lead ecg recordings were performed at screening, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 168 h post-dose and at follow-up. analysis of the results by plasma netupitant concentration at the time of apomorphine challenge showed a decrease in the incidence of vomiting with increasing netupitant levels. no subject in the highest concentration group (&gt; 300 ng/ml, corresponding to 1 subject taking 300 mg and 5 subjects taking 450 mg) experienced vomiting, a statistically significant result compared to placebo (p = 0.010).
</p>
<p>
subjects with lower netupitant concentrations also experienced less vomiting than the placebo group. in the three groups with lower netupitant concentrations, 50% of subjects experienced no vomiting (n=18), compared with 25% of subjects vomiting-free in the placebo group (n=8). in total, 15 out of the 24 subjects who received netupitant experienced no vomiting, with six subjects having fewer than 6 vomiting episodes. only 2 of the 8 subjects receiving placebo experienced less than 6 vomiting episodes.

netu-06-08 was undertaken to assess the degree of neurokinin-1 receptor occupancy in the human brain after a single dose of netupitant in healthy male subjects this was a single dose, randomised, open-label, pet study investigating the degree of occupancy of nk1 receptors in the human brain after single oral doses of netupitant in healthy male subjects. subjects were randomised to a single dose of 100, 300 or 450 mg. the study consisted of a screening visit, a baseline pet visit, a treatment period with up to 5 post dose pet scans and a follow-up visit. the screening assessments were performed within 28 days before dose administration, the baseline pet visit was performed within 7 days before dose administration and the follow-up visit was performed 14 ±2 days after dose administration.
</p>
<p>
pet scans were performed 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after dose administration. 8 healthy white males aged between 20 to 25 years were randomised, 6 completed the study. two subjects were withdrawn because the baseline pet scans were lost. these 2 subjects were replaced by two further subjects. two of the eight were not treated (no reason given).
</p>
<p>
the results of this investigation demonstrated that netupitant is a potent selective nk1 receptor antagonist in the human brain with an ability to block nk1 receptors in the human brain for a relatively long time. the anticipated high nk1-ro (90% or higher) close to expected cmax (6 hours post dose) was achieved for occipital cortex and frontal cortex for all investigated doses as well as for striatum (for 300 and 450 mg netupitant) and anterior cingulate (for 100 and 450 mg netupitant).
</p>
<p>
all doses showed a relatively long duration of blockade of the nk1 receptors and for most regions the nk1-ro declined slowly until 96 hours post dose in a dose-dependent fashion. in the 100 mg dose group, 4 of 6 regions still had a mean nk1-ro over 70% at 96 hours post dose. in the highest dose group (450 mg), 5 of 6 regions had a mean nk1-ro near to 80% or higher at 96 hours post dose. a comparison of the results for the dose groups (100 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg) showed a general but low increase in nk1-ros with increasing dose.

</header>
<p>
a clear relationship was observed between degree of nk1-ro in striatum and plasma concentrations of netupitant (figure 4). based on the pk/pd parameter estimates, a netupitant plasma concentration of 225 μg/l corresponds to nk1 receptor occupancy of 90% in striatum. a good fit of the predicted pk-pd relationship was obtained and the ec50 determined for striatum was 10.2 μg/l (cv: 14.5%). in contrast the other considered brain regions showed a more narrow range of nk1-ro and therefore the ec50 values for the cortex areas could only be estimated with low precision.

one safety study was conducted netu-07-20: thorough qt study in health volunteers. a double-blind randomised parallel-group trial to investigate possible ecg effects of netupitant/palonosetron using a clinical and a supratherapeutic dose compared to placebo and moxifloxacin (a positive control) in healthy men and women: a thorough ecg trial. the primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the administration of netupitant in combination with palonosetron does not prolong the qt interval more than placebo in male and female healthy subjects. secondary objectives were to evaluate the general safety and tolerability of netupitant in combination with palonosetron as well as the relative safety in comparison with moxifloxacin with focus on ecg parameters in healthy subjects and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of netupitant (and its metabolites m1, m2, and m3) and palonosetron (and its metabolites m4 and m9) in plasma. the study was a randomised, double-blind (except for the moxifloxacin active control), double-dummy, parallel-group, placebo and open-label positive-controlled study design involving four study groups: placebo; netupitant with palonosetron (200 mg + 0.50 mg); netupitant with palonosetron (600 mg + 1.50 mg); and moxifloxacin (400 mg). the study was carried out in one treatment period of three days with administration of study drug on day 1.
</p>
<p>
two-hundred (200) healthy subjects (106 men and 94 women) participated in the treatment phase of the study. men and women were included to reflect the target population for the therapy with netupitant. a centralized ecg reading lab was used to read the ecgs with interpretation by a high-resolution semi-automatic on-screen caliper method with annotations to minimize inter-reader variability. the central ecg laboratory was blinded to subjects and their treatment.
</p>
<p>
all treatments included a 24 h baseline and then all the subjects received a single dose of treatment, followed by ecg and pharmacokinetic measurements for 2 days. the results of this ecg trial showed no signal of any effect on av conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the pr and qrs interval durations. there was a non-dose related reduction in heart rate of 3 bpm in the palonosetron/netupitant groups of questionable clinical importance. there were no new clinically relevant morphological changes.
</p>
<p>
the effect of netupitant/palonosetron on cardiac repolarization using all of the qtc interval formulas shows no signal of relevant change. figure 5 below shows the change in qtci (delta-delta) versus time for palonosetron/netupitant combinations and the positive control, moxifloxacin.

the extent of absorption (auc) for netupitant was proportional to the dose administered with a dose proportional increase of the geometric mean auc of 4079 h*μg/l at 200 mg to 12213 h*μg/l at 600 mg oral dose. for cmax the same dose proportionality was observed with 219 μg/l at 200 mg and 648 μg/l at 600 mg dose. the inter subject variability of netupitant pharmacokinetics is high with a variability of 42% and 48% for auc and cmax at 200 mg and 47% and 56% for auc and cmax at 600 mg dose.
</p>
<p>
for palonosetron a dose proportional increase was observed for auc (22641 h*ng/l at 0.5 mg to 67918 h*ng/l at 1.5 mg) and for cmax (822 ng/l to 2588 ng/l). the inter subject variability of palonosetron is lower as compared to netupitant with a variability of 25% and 29% for auc and cmax at 0.5 mg and 20% and 23% for auc and cmax at 1.5 mg dose.

overall measurable plasma netupitant concentrations were detected between 15 minutes and 3 hours after dosing in single dose oral studies. after this lag time, plasma concentrations followed a first order absorption process and reached cmax in approximately 4-5 hours. netupitant is eliminated from the body in a multi-exponential fashion, with an apparent mean elimination half-life ranging from 30 to approximately 100 hours (across all studies for doses of 30 mg to 450 mg) with a few longer outliers. netupitant is not dose proportional in doses from 10 to 300mg but dose proportionality has been demonstrated for the 300mg to 450 mg doses. no absolute studies on bioavailability with netupitant were carried out but it is estimated based on two iv studies with netupitant that the oral preparation has a greater than 60% bioavailability. netupitant is highly protein bound. the mean volume of distribution in humans ranged from approximately 850l to over 2000l indicating substantial distribution of netupitant into the tissues. netupitant is metabolised in the liver and is primarily excreted excreted via the hepatic/biliary routes, with renal clearance (clr) accounting for less than 5% of cl. in early studies, 3 active metabolites were identified (m1, m2 and m3). in plasma from humans who were administered oral netupitant, netupitant and its 3 major metabolites were extensively bound (&gt; 97%) to plasma protein at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1500 ng/ml. based on a gerbil foot tapping nk1 assay these metabolites appear to be pharmacologically active. after one week daily dosing in healthy volunteers a greater than three times exposure to netupitant was shown. given that this fdc is intended for single administration with each chemotherapy cycle subsequent administration can be assumed to be often separated by a 3 week interval to assure a complete washout from the previous administration. with a half-life of netupitant, active metabolites m1, m2, m3 and palonosetron averaging between approximately 40 and 80 h, at the start of a new chemotherapy cycle at least 6.3 half-lives would have elapsed and approximately 99% of the dose would have been eliminated before the next dose. even in patients who underwent chemotherapy every 2 weeks (e.g., study netu-10-29), at the start of a new chemotherapy cycle approximately 95% of the dose would have been eliminated prior to the next dose in 4.2 half-lives, allowing for clinically insignificant accumulation. in an earlier study (n =11) investigating the effect of food netupitant alone showed a marked increase on exposure and cmax in the fed state whereas in a more recent study (n=22) exposing subjects to the fdc only a slight increase in exposure and cmax of netupitant in the fed states was shown. given that the latter study was conducted with a larger population and with the fdc the results from this study are given greater emphasis. as the differences in pk with the fdc combination were marginal the fdc can be given with or without food. the pk in the target population is similar to that in healthy volunteers though greater inter-subject variability was demonstrated in the cancer chemotherapy population. inter-subject variability in the fed state for the
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 72/153 proposed netupitant dose is moderate, and high in the fasted state, in those with hepatic impairment, the elderly and those taking netupitant with etoposide.
</p>
<p>
there is a gender effect for both palonosetron and netupitant with higher exposure and cmax for palonosetron in females and higher cmax for netupitant not deflected in a greater incidence of adverse events in females compared to males. exposure and cmaxare also higher in older people in whom exposure to netupitant and palansetron increased by 25% and 37% respectively and cmax by 10% and 36% respectively. these differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and so no dose adjustments are indicated in elderly subjects. nevertheless all but four of the older people exposed to the fdc were aged under 75 therefore there is limited exposure of the older old (&gt; 75 years) to the fdc in pk studies.
</p>
<p>
as netupitant and palonosetron in the fdc showed increased exposure in older people in general it is possible that exposure with the same dose is greater in patients &gt; 75 years. therefore a precautionary statement to this age population was included in section 4.2 of the smpc and the rmp reflects experience in patients aged 75 years and more as missing information. no studies were carried out with the fdc on subjects with renal impairment. this was justified by the applicant on the basis that renal clearance accounts for only 5% of cl and a population pk/pd study netu-10-02 (which included 118 subjects from the phase 111 study netu-08-18) did not demonstrate any influence of renal impairment on pk therefore the fdc can be administered without dose adjustion. however no patients with severe renal impairment were included in this study. as no conclusions can be drawn regarding dosing in patients with severe renal impairment the smpc states that the use in these patients should be avoided. overall, increases in exposure of netupitant and palonosetron in the fdc were observed in subjects with hepatic impairment presumably due to reduced hepatic metabolism. exposure and c max increased by 70% to 143% patients with moderate hepatic impairment. although the increases were statistically significant, they are of questionable clinical significance and variability in the healthy control groups was large and renders the comparisons difficult to interpret. safety data in the hepatic impairment study showed no differences between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects with respect to safety profile and no dose reduction are indicated. considering that each dose is given as a once off before chemotherapy this is acceptable. furthermore modelling of accumulation has demonstrated minimal accumulation of netupitant with 300mg administered at 3 or 2 weekly intervals. given the lack of evidence for significant accumulation of netupitant with 2 or 3 weekly dosing, and the tolerance of higher exposure levels, no dose adjustment for moderate hepatic impairment is required.
</p>
<p>
limited conclusions can be drawn however for patients with severe hepatic impairment due to the low number of subjects included in this group. therefore a cautionary statement on increased exposure and on the limited data available in severe hepatic impairment was included in section 4.4. of the smpc.
</p>
<p>
netupitant is primarily metabolized via hepatic cytochrome p450 3a4. in general, genetic polymorphism of cyp3a4 results in a decrease in enzyme activity, but occurs in a small proportion of the population across all of the affected alleles. specific studies to evaluate effect of genetic polymorphism of cyp3a4 on netupitant disposition were not conducted but considering that even a remarkable reduction of the cyp3a4 enzymatic activity such as that occurred when a strong cy3a4 inhibitor is co-administered with netupitant, is not expected to increase netupitant exposure more than approximately 2-fold and the large safety margin established for netupitant in the clinical program this is acceptable.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 73/153 cyp3a4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased the auc of netupitant 1.8 fold, whereas cyp3a4 inducer rifampicin as expected decreased the auc to netupitant considerably (5.2 fold). this information is appropriately reflected in the smpc. netupitant increased exposure to other cyp3a4 substrates e.g erythromycin, midazolam, levonorgestrel and dexamethasone therefore it should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant orally anministered active substances that are metabolized through this enzyme as labelled in the smpc. co-administration of a single dose of 300mg netupitant with dexamethasone led to a significant increase in dexamethasone exposure in a time and dose related manner. the auc0-24 (day 1), the auc24-36 (day 2) and the auc84-108 and auc84-∞ (day 4) of dexamethasone increased 2.4-fold, with co-administration of 300 mg netupitant. therefore recommended oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when co-administered with akynzeo as stated in the smpc. dexamethasone, midazolam and erythromycin had no effect on netupitant levels. based on development program, the potential for netupitant interaction with chemotherapy agents metabolized by cyp3a4 was considered, and three in vitro studies were conducted with vincristine, cyclophosphamide and docetaxel as representative chemotherapeutic agents known to be metabolized by cyp3a4. these in vitro results were investigated in cancer patients (netu-10-09) and an increase of auc0-t values was reported for each chemotherapeutic agent when akynzeo was concomitantly administered, as compared to other antiemetic treatments (palonosetron). on average, the exposure increased 1.35-fold for docetaxel, 1.28-fold for etoposide and 1.20-fold for cyclophosphamide. therefore precautionary statements on chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for cyp3a4 were included in the smpc. the potential of netupitant and its three main metabolites m1, m2 and m3 to inhibit ugt enzymes in both pooled human liver microsomes and a panel of cdna expressed recombinant human ugt enzymes showed that in vivo interaction upon netupitant administration is possible at intestinal level during the absorption phase of orally administered drugs with poor/moderate oral bioavailability (f% &lt; 50%) which are mainly metabolized by ugt2b7. whereas the magnitude of such an effect in the clinical setting is not established a cautionary statement on this possible interaction was added to the smpc and it was added to the rmp as a potential risk. bcrp and p-gp are both inhibited in vitro by netupitant with similar ic50 values, i.e., 6 and 3 μm, respectively. since in vitro data show that netupitant inhibits bcrp, and, even though clinical adverse events related to bcrp inhibition are rare, information on inhibition of the efflux transporter bcrp was included in the smpc.

a decrease in the incidence of vomiting was noted with increasing netupitant levels. no subject in the highest concentration group (&gt; 300 ng/ml, corresponding to 1 subject taking 300 mg and 5 subjects taking 450 mg) experienced vomiting, a statistically significant result compared to placebo (p = 0.010). however nausea appeared to increase with increasing exposure. a pet study demonstrated that netupitant is a potent selective nk1 receptor antagonist in the human brain with an ability to block nk1 receptors for a relatively long time. in the population pd analysis a clear relationship was not demonstrated between exposure and response. however there was a correlation between clearance/f and response.

2.5.1.  dose response studies
</header>
<p>
early studies evaluated the clinical pharmacology of netupitant using an apomorphine challenge model (np16602) followed by an nk1 receptor binding assay (pet study; netu-06-08). these two studies led to an understanding that the therapeutic dose in humans was likely to be in the 100-300 mg dose range. subsequently, phase 2 study netu-07-07 was designed to test 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg netupitant with palonosetron 0.50 mg against palonosetron 0.50 mg alone. results led to selection of the netupitant/palonosetron 300 mg/0.50 mg combination dose used in phase 3 trials.

methods study participants
</header>
<p>
the study population consisted of adult (≥ 18 years of age) chemotherapy naïve male or female patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumours who were scheduled to receive highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy. patients were required to have a karnofsky index ≥ 70% and to be able to understand and follow study procedures and complete the patient diary. female patients of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening and to practice concurrently two reliable methods of contraception during the study. patients could not participate in the study if they were currently using illicit drugs or abusing alcohol, were scheduled to receive moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy from day 2 to 5 following cisplatin administration, received (within 1 week prior to day 1) or were scheduled to receive (days 1 to 5 after cisplatin administration) moderately or highly emetogenic radiotherapy, took any drug with potential antiemetic efficacy within 24 hours prior to day 1, took systemic corticosteroids within 72 hours prior to day 1, or took nk1 receptor antagonists or any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to day 1, or had other medical conditions or personal circumstances that would interfere with interpretation of study results or expose the patient to an unacceptable risk.

outcomes/endpoints
</header>
<p>
the primary outcome was complete response rate at 120h (overall) following initiation of cycle 1 chemotherapy regimen. complete response was defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication. secondary outcome measures included; • cr at 0-24h (acute phase) and 25-120h (delayed phase), • complete protection, defined as no emesis, no rescue medication, and no significant nausea (defined as &lt;25mm on vas) • total control, as above with no nausea (defined as &lt;5mm on vas) • no nausea • no significant nausea • no rescue medication • no emesis, these were evaluated during the acute (0-24h), delayed (25-120h) and overall (0-120h) phases. they were also evaluated for each 24h subset during the total evaluation period. other secondary endpoints were; • time to 1st emetic episode • time to rescue medication • time to treatment failure ( defined as time to emetic episode or rescue medication)
</p>

sample size
</header>
<p>
the sample size was estimated to be 680 patients, distributed across five treatment groups (136 patients per group). the assumption was a responder rate of 70% in the netupitant and palonosetron group (plus dexamethasone regimen) and 50% in the palonosetron alone group (plus dexamethasone regimen). for a one-sided test of difference, using α=0.0166 (obtained as type i error divided by the number of comparisons = 0.050/ 3), a sample size of 129 evaluable patients per group was needed to ensure 85% power for each comparison. the number was rounded up to 136 patients per treatment group.

randomisation
</header>
<p>
patients were assigned to treatment groups using a randomisationlist that was stratified by gender. within strata (gender), patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to one of five treatment groups in a balanced design (i.e., in the ratio 1:1:1:1:1). a randomisationlist was prepared prior to the start of the study. according to this randomisationlist, sealed cartons containing the study drug and additional study drug were supplied to the investigational sites. patients were randomised by the investigator using an interactive voice response system (ivrs) in accordance with study-specific procedures. a dynamic adaptive stratification type of randomisation method that balanced the five treatment groups according to the patient gender was used. treatments were balanced across the entire study, not within each individual site. the general strategy of this randomisation was to give additional probability to receiving a specific treatment if it was underrepresented in the current randomisation status. patients who were randomised but never received study treatment were not considered during the following patient randomisation/treatment assignment. this ensured that a balance among treatment groups in the treated population was being maintained. the investigator was trained to immediately notify the ivrs if a randomised patient did not receive study treatment. the relevant algorithm to this method tailored for this study was described in the appropriate ivrs document.

statistical methods
</header>
<p>
the primary study objective was to find out whether or not at least one of three doses of netupitant combined with palonosetron was more effective than palonosetron alone based on the complete response rate at 0-120 hours (cr 0-120).
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 79/153 therefore, the primary statistical analysis of efficacy was designed to reject the composite null hypothesis that none of the three combinations of the active netupitant dose combined with palonosetron was more effective than palonosetron alone. the holm-bonferroni method was used to control for the type i error. the primary efficacy endpoint was the complete response during 0-120 hours.
</p>
<p>
the complete response rate during 0-120 hours was summarized by treatment arm. the number and the proportion of the patients with cr 0-120 were presented in a frequency table. for the response rate and for the difference in response rate between each palonosetron plus netupitant dose group and palonosetron alone group, the 95% ci were provided. pairwise comparisons between palonosetron plus netupitant dose group and palonosetron alone group were performed using chi-square test. the main question of the study was whether or not the null-hypothesis (h0) that none of the regimens of netupitant combined with palonosetron was superior to the oral palonosetron alone (0.5 mg) can be rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis that at least one dose of oral netupitant and palonosetron was superior to oral palonosetron alone (0.5 mg), considering the complete response rate at 0-120 hours. the primary test was performed using a logistic regression adjusted for the covariate (gender), where each dose of netupitant combined with a fixed dose of palonosetron and dexamethasone was compared to palonosetron alone and dexamethasone. in order to test the null hypothesis, three one-sided tests were conducted with three separate null hypotheses: hi (i=1, 2, 3) with the corresponding p-values pi that stated the linear coefficient that corresponds to the i-th active treatment in the logistic regression model was not positive. the general null-hypothesis, therefore, becomes the intersection of these three, and the holm-bonferroni procedure for testing the general hypothesis was used as follows. the three p-values were ordered in the increasing order as p(1)&lt;p(2)&lt;p(3) if the smallest of the three p-values p(1) did not exceed 0.05/3 then the corresponding hi was rejected and the p(2) was compared to 0.05/2, and if p(2)&lt;= 0.05/2, then the hypothesis corresponding to p(2) was also rejected, and the remaining p(3) was compared to 0.05. in case p(3) ≤
</p>
<p>
0.05, then the corresponding hi was also rejected. at this point, all the null hypotheses that were not been rejected remain not rejected, and the procedure terminated with the global h0 rejected only if at least one of the hi was rejected. for the primary analysis, patients with missing data were classified as not having a complete response. the same logistic regression model was used to compare each dose of palonosetron plus netupitant to each other. this was done on a descriptive level, i.e. without adjustment for multiplicity. a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was added which excluded patients who did not complete diaries or did not provide information about emetic episode and/or use of rescue medication who were considered, in the primary analysis, as non responders following the worst case principle. the sensitivity analysis was only performed for the mfas population. additional analyses were suggested by the fda during the interactions for planning the phase iii development. the details of the changes are as follows: i. analysis considering the cr in the delayed phase (defined as 25-120 hours after chemotherapy) as the primary efficacy endpoint. since the delayed phase is the time frame where nk1 receptor antagonists are expected to be more effective, in the fda opinion, the most sensitive endpoint for establishing the contribution of netupitant to the efficacy of the combination product is the cr 25-120 rather than the original primary efficacy endpoint cr 0-120. for
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 80/153 this reason cr 25-120 was suggested to be the primary efficacy endpoint for the phase iii development. also, netu- 07-07, in the light of his potential new role of pivotal study, should have been analysed accordingly. ii. analysis using the cochran-mantel-haenszel (cmh) test stratified by gender. the original analysis of the primary endpoint cr 0-120 was performed using a logistic regression model adjusted for gender. the fda requested to replace this statistical test with the cochran-mantel-haenszel (cmh) test stratified by gender. iii. analysis using a hierarchical procedure to control the type i error. the procedure is to be applied to three endpoints cr in the delayed (cr 25-120), acute (cr 0-24) and overall (cr 0-120) phases. in the original plan, cr 0-24 and cr 25-120 were secondary efficacy endpoints and, as such, no specific procedure was in place for dealing with multiplicity.
</p>
<p>
iv. sensitivity analysis on the intention-to-treat (itt) population defined as all randomised patients. as mentioned, the efficacy analysis was originally performed considering the mfas as the primary population of analysis. in addition, analysis on the pp population and a sensitivity analysis on complete cases were performed.

conduct of the study

<p>
the sponsor conducted a trial site audit to support the use of this study as the pivotal efficacy trial for hec indication.
</p>
<p>
one site in russia (site no. 120) presented multiple major audit findings, ranging from failure to meet eligibility criteria and administration of prohibited medications to inconsistencies between source data and case report forms (crfs). regardless of these findings, according to intent to treat principles, the site remains part of all planned analyses. however, to explore whether this site has had any impact on the treatment effect, the sponsor provided the cr rates obtained after exclusion of all 39 patients enrolled at this site. the following table summarizes the cr rates in the overall (0-120 hours), acute (0-24 hours) and delayed (25-120 hours) phases after the start of chemotherapy administration, which were obtained for the full analysis set (fas) and the cr rates without/withdrawing the 39 patients from site no. 120.

<p>
cr rates across all treatment groups and in all three periods achieved after excluding all 39 patients from site 120 are consistent with the cr rates from fas. the differences in cr rates, with and without site 120, for the netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg group are 0.7% in both, the overall and delayed phases, and 0.1% in the acute phase. when considering all treatment groups, the largest difference is 1.1%. furthermore, the differences in cr rates did not seem to be systematically in one direction. this evidence supports the lack of impact of this site and the overall robustness of the study conclusions.

ema/236963/2015 page 86/153 the populations were defined as follows: the full analysis set population (fas) was defined as all patients who were randomised to treatment and received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen and at least one dose of study treatment. following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were assigned to the study treatment group according to the treatment to which they have been randomised. the fas was used for summarizing demography and baseline characteristics. the modified fas (mfas) population consisted of the fas population excluding patients randomised to aprepitant treatment arm. this was the primary population for efficacy evaluation. mfas was used for demography, baseline characteristics and efficacy parameters analysis. the per-protocol (pp) population consisted of all patients included in the mfas who completed the 0-120 study period and were compliant with the study protocol. the pp population was analyzed for the primary efficacy parameter, demographic data, and selected baseline characteristics. the safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one study treatment and had at least one safety assessment after the treatment administration. patients were assigned to the study treatment group according to the actual treatment received. the safety population was analyzed for demography, baseline characteristics and safety analysis.

\l &quot;t17_2&quot; table 17.2 significant benefit was seen for the 300mg dose in all phases. • time to first emetic event kaplan meier curves of netupitant 300 mg and palonosetron alone started to diverge a few hours after chemotherapy. curves of netupitant 100 mg and 200 mg were very similar, but diverged from the curve for palonosetron alone later than the netupitant 300 mg curve did. the curves clearly show the higher efficacy of netupitant 300 mg in the first 24 hours and up to 44 hours compared to lower doses of netupitant. since more than 75% of patients were considered censored at the end of the 120 hour observation period in all treatment groups (i.e. more than 75% of patients had no emetic episode throughout 120 hours), neither the 25% quantile nor the median time to first emetic episode could be calculated. a log-rank test stratified by gender showed that time to first emetic episode was significant longer for netupitant (p=0.003) and in each netupitant group (p≤ 0.020) than in the palonosetron alone group.

• patient global satisfaction for the mfas population, the daily mean patient global satisfaction ranged from 89.1 to 91.2 for the palonosetron alone group and from 92.3 to 93.8, 92.0 to 94.6, and 94.0 to 95.3 for the netupitant 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg doses, respectively. during each 24-hour interval, the median score was 97.0 or 98.0 in all treatment groups describing a very high patient satisfaction with the therapy for controlling the nausea and vomiting. although the mean global satisfaction was smaller for palonosetron alone than for each dose of netupitant, the differences between palonosetron alone and the netupitant doses were small (0.85 to 5.51) and generally were not statistically significant. • no rescue medication in the mfas population, antiemetic rescue medication to treat emesis or nausea was taken by 6 (4.4%), 3 (2.2%), and 2 (1.5%) patients in the palonosetron, netupitant 100 mg, and netupitant 300 mg groups, respectively. rescue medication included metoclopramide and ondansetron. three patients (2 in the palonosetron group, 1 in the netupitant 300 mg group) received antiemetics as prevention of nausea and vomiting for a subsequent cycle of chemotherapy. since the antiemetic drugs were administered as prevention and cannot be considered as rescue medication, those three patients were not counted. • exploratory analysis – aprepitant and ondasetron arm

the study population consisted of adult (≥18 years of age) chemotherapy-naïve male or female patients scheduled to receive their first course of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide mec regimen for the treatment of a solid malignant tumour. patients were required to have an eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status of 0, 1, or 2, fulfil criteria indicating a hematologic and metabolic status adequate for receiving a mec regimen, and to be able to understand/follow study procedures and complete the patient diary. female patients of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study drugs on day 1 and to practice an acceptable method of contraception during the study. patients could not participate in the study if they experienced vomiting, retching, or mild nausea within 24 hours prior to day 1, if they were currently using illicit drugs or abusing alcohol, were scheduled to receive any highly emetogenic chemotherapy (hec) from day 1 to day 5 or mec from day 2 to day 5 following the allowed mec regimen, received (within 1 week prior to day 1) or were scheduled to receive (between days 1 to 5 of cycle 1) radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis, had symptomatic primary or metastatic central nervous system malignancy or any uncontrolled medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have confounded the results of the study or posed unwarranted risk in administering the study medication. females could not be pregnant or lactating. for inclusion in the multiple-cycle extension, participation had to be considered appropriate by the investigator and could not pose unwarranted risk to the patient. in addition, the patient had to have demonstrated satisfactory study compliance in the preceding chemotherapy cycles and study procedures. patients entered the multiple cycle extension if receiving the same chemotherapy regimen as at cycle 1 and if they had an adequate metabolic status. patients could not participate in the multiple-cycle extension if they had an active infection or uncontrolled disease except for malignancy, had started any restricted medications, or had vomiting, retching, or mild nausea within 24 hours prior to day 1. females could not be pregnant or lactating.

patients were randomised to receive either the oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) fdc with oral dexamethasone 12 mg or oral palonosetron 0.50 mg with oral dexamethasone 20 mg preceding the administration of mec on the first day of cycle 1. after cycle 1, patients could continue in a multiple-cycle extension phase, i.e., they could participate in consecutive repeated chemotherapy cycles (at least 21 days apart from each other) as long as they continued to fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria. on day 1 of each repeat cycle, the patients received the same study drugs as in cycle 1. during cycle 1, patients participated in the study for a maximum of 37 days (including an up to 14 days screening period, one day of treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call of 21±2 days after day 1). in the multiple-cycle extension, patients participated for a maximum of 30 days in every repeat cycle (including an up to 7 days screening period, one day of treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call 21±2 days after day 1.

objectives
</header>
<p>
the primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of a single oral dose of a fixed combination of netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) with oral dexamethasone versus oral palonosetron 0.50 mg with oral dexamethasone in terms of complete response (cr) in the delayed phase (25-120 hours) at cycle 1. secondary objectives were: • to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of a fixed-dose combination (fdc) of netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) with oral dexamethasone to oral palonosetron 0.50 mg with oral dexamethasone for the prevention of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mec)-induced nausea and vomiting in initial and repeat cycles. • to assess the population pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of netupitant (and its metabolites m1, m2 and m3) and palonosetron in patients that have received the combination product.

outcomes/endpoints
</header>
<p>
efficacy: the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with cr (defined as no emesis, no rescue medication) in the delayed phase (time interval 25-120 hours after the start of the mec administration) at cycle 1. key secondary efficacy endpoints were defined at cycle 1 as the proportion of patients with: • cr during the acute phase (0-24 hours). • cr during the overall phase (0-120 hours). other secondary efficacy endpoints were defined at cycle 1 as the proportion of patients with: • no emesis during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. • no rescue medication during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. • no significant nausea (visual analogue scale [vas] &lt;25 mm) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. • no nausea (vas &lt;5 mm) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. • complete protection (no emesis, no rescue medication and no significant nausea [maximum nausea vas &lt;25 mm]) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. • total control (no emesis, no rescue medication and no nausea [maximum vas &lt;5 mm]) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. other efficacy endpoints at cycle 1 were defined as follows: • severity of nausea, defined as the maximum nausea on the vas in the acute, delayed, and overall phase. • time to first emetic episode, time to first rescue medication intake, and time to treatment failure (based on time to the first emetic episode or time to the first rescue medication intake, whichever occurs first) • impact on patients’ daily life activities for the first 120 hours following the administration of mec as assessed by the functional living index-emesis (flie) questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 100/153 secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated during the multiple-cycle extension were the proportion of patients with: • cr during the delayed, acute, and overall phase following subsequent cycles of mec. • no significant nausea during the delayed, acute, and overall phase following subsequent mec cycles. safety: safety assessments included physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg), left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), cardiac troponin i (ctni) levels, laboratory tests (haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis) and adverse events (aes). population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: details on the population pk and pd of netupitant (and its metabolites m1, m2 and m3) and palonosetron are described in a separate study report (netu-10-02).

sample size
</header>
<p>
the sample size was estimated to be 1460 patients, equally distributed in 2 treatment groups (730 patients per group). the assumption was a cr rate in the time interval 25-120 hours of cycle 1 of 60% in the netupitant/palonosetron fixed combination group and 51% in the palonosetron group. for a 2-sided test of difference using α=0.050, a sample size of 661 evaluable patients per group was needed to ensure 90% power to detect the above mentioned 9% difference. this number was increased to 730 patients per treatment group for a total of 1460 patients, to ensure an adequate number of evaluable patients. regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoints, this same sample size gave the study a power of about 60% (61%) to detect a difference of 6% in the cr rate in the acute phase (assuming rates of 70% and 64% in the fixed combination and palonosetron groups, respectively). the power to detect a difference of 9% in terms of cr in the overall phase was close to 90%.

randomisation
</header>
<p>
patients were assigned to treatment groups through a static central blocked randomisation scheme, stratified by region (us, latin america including mexico, europe, commonwealth of independent states [i.e., former soviet republics], asia) and age class (age &lt;55 years and age ≥ 55 years). patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a balanced design (1:1), according to specific procedures using the randomisation and trial supply management (rtsm) system, accessed by electronic data capture (edc) or interactive voice response system (ivrs). two randomisation lists were prepared, one for each age class. for each region a different block of the relevant list was allocated, i.e., each time a new region started to randomize patients or each time a block for the relevant region was completed, the next unused block was attributed to that region.

<p>
efficacy: the number and percentage of patients with cr by treatment group and the difference in response rate between the treatment groups was summarized. the 95% confidence interval (ci) for the response rate
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 101/153 (using the wilson score method) and for the difference in response rate (using newcombe-wilson method) were also provided. the primary analysis was performed on the fas using a 2-sided stratum adjusted cochran mantel haenszel (cmh) test including treatment, age class and region as strata. all missing data were imputed as treatment failures, following the worst case principle. the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments was to be rejected, and the superiority of the fixed combination versus oral palonosetron alone demonstrated, if the 2-sided p-value from the cmh test was less than or equal to 0.050 and in the right direction i.e., the odds ratio (or) was in favour of the fixed combination. the ors and the 2-sided 95% ci for the ors from the cmh test were presented.
</p>
<p>
key and other secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the same way. to avoid type i error inflation, a hierarchical approach to testing was used. once the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for the primary efficacy endpoint was rejected (i.e., primary study objective was met), further confirmatory statistical tests were performed on key secondary efficacy endpoints in the following order: cr in the acute phase, followed by cr in the overall phase (tested only if the fixed oral combination was superior to oral palonosetron for cr in the acute phase).
</p>
<p>
the other secondary efficacy endpoints (no emesis, no rescue medication intake, no nausea, no significant nausea, complete protection and total control) were grouped together into families by phase (delayed, acute, and overall). each family was tested only if the fixed combination demonstrated superiority versus oral palonosetron for cr for that phase. results of analyses for other efficacy endpoints were interpreted descriptively with nominal p-values. safety: all safety analyses were performed for the safety population for cycle 1 and the multiple-cycle extension. the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes), defined as an ae that begins or worsens in severity after the start of the first administration of the study drug, in each treatment group was presented overall, by system organ class and preferred term, and additionally grouped by severity and relationship to the study drug. teae relationship was summarized separately for events related to study drugs (netupitant/palonosetron, palonosetron), events related to dexamethasone, and overall (i.e., related to study drugs or dexamethasone). the number of patients with serious teaes and the number of patients with teaes leading to discontinuation of study were summarized. all aes were listed.
</p>
<p>
laboratory data were summarized as follows: descriptive statistics for observed values and change from baseline (and the same cycle ‘screening’ for cycle 2 onwards), shift tables from baseline (and the same cycle ‘screening’ for cycle 2 onwards) with respect to normal ranges, and tabulation of the number of patients with at least one marked abnormality (national cancer institute common toxicology criteria [nci ctc] grade ≥ 3) for selected haematology and blood chemistry parameters with respect to normal ranges. all data were listed.
</p>
<p>
ctni levels were summarized for each visit by treatment for cycle 1 and the multiple cycle extension using descriptive statistics. all troponin levels were listed.
</p>
<p>
ecg data were summarized highlighting differences from baseline (and the same cycle ‘pre-dose reference value’ for cycle 2 onwards) for quantitative variables and frequencies of treatment-emergent abnormalities. an outlier analysis was performed to show the number of patients who met pre-specified criteria. physical examination, vital signs and left ventricular ejection fraction data were summarized using descriptive statistics, in addition to being listed.

supportive studies study palo-10-01
</header>
<p>
was a phase iii, multicenter, multinational, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, stratified study in patients receiving hec. patients were randomised on day 1 of their first chemotherapy cycle before administration of hec to one of the following treatment groups: • oral palonosetron 0.50 mg (aloxi) and oral dexamethasone 20 mg both given on day 1, followed by dexamethasone (8 mg) twice daily (bid) from days 2 through 4. • i.v. palonosetron 0.25 mg (aloxi) and oral dexamethasone 20 mg both given on day 1, followed by dexamethasone (8 mg bid) from days 2 through 4. patients participated in the study for a maximum of 37 days (including a screening period of up to 14 days, 6+2 days on study of which 4 days on active treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call 21±2 days after day 1). study palo-10-01 was intended to provide evidence of efficacy of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg in the hec setting in comparison to i.v. palonosetron 0.25 mg, focusing on the 0-24 hour period.
</p>
<p>
the primary efficacy objective was the demonstration of non-inferiority of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg versus i.v. palonosetron 0.25 mg in terms of proportion of patients with cr in the acute phase (defined as no emesis and no rescue medication within 24 hours after the start of the hec administration).
</p>
<p>
the percentage of patients with cr in the acute phase in the fas was 89.4% in the oral palonosetron group and 86.2% in the i.v. palonosetron group. the difference in proportion between the oral and i.v. palonosetron groups was 3.21% (99%ci: -2.74% to 9.17%).
</p>
<p>
non-inferiority of oral palonosetron versus i.v. palonosetron was demonstrated since the lower limit of the two-sided 99% ci for the difference in proportions was greater (i.e. closer to zero) than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin set at -15%. similar results were obtained in the pp population with a difference in proportions between the oral and i.v. palonosetron group of 3.77% (99% ci: -3.22% to 10.76% from stratum-adjusted cmh method for difference in proportions). planned sensitivity analyses supported the results obtained on the primary efficacy endpoint.

was a safety trial providing also supportive efficacy information in mec and hec. it was a multinational, randomised active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, unbalanced (3:1), parallel group, stratified multi-cycle trial evaluating the safety and describing the efficacy of the fdc vs aprepitant + palonosetron. the study was stratified by chemotherapy emetogenicity and gender.
</p>
<p>
the primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of fdc in initial and repeated cycles of chemotherapy. the secondary objective was to describe the efficacy of the fdc during the acute (0-24 hours), delayed (25-120 hours) and overall (0-120 hours) phases of initial and repeated cycles of chemotherapy. efficacy data were supportive of the conclusions drawn from the pivotal trials.

design and conduct of clinical studies
</header>
<p>
chmp scientific advice given to the design and conduct of the clinical studies was broadly followed. the patient population recruited to clinical trials was appropriate and generally representative of those normally receiving such chemotherapy regimens. it was noted by the chmp that in the mec study netu-08-18 an anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (ac) regime was chosen to support the mec indication. recently, in the mec setting, mascc/esmo clinical antiemetic guidelines have given special consideration to patient-related risk factors contributing to the emetogenic potential for patients receiving ac-based chemotherapy. while historically guidance has been based solely on the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy the young age and female gender of the population that typically receive ac-based chemotherapy may put this group at an increased risk for cinv over what ac chemotherapy alone would suggest. it is taken into consideration by the chmp that ac chemotherapy has previously served as gold standard of the mec regimen in antiemetic efficacy pivotal trials being a “worst-case” emetogenicity representative for mec chemotherapy. notwithstanding the recent change of the clinical antiemetic guidelines this model is currently considered to be familiar to clinicians for use to prevent cinv induced by mec. therefore, to adequately inform prescribers, the fact that an ac regimen was used in the mec pivotal trial was included into the smpc. dose levels and groups as described are considered appropriate with regards to the objectives of the pivotal trials submitted and dexamethasone doses were appropriately adjusted to balance exposure across groups. objectives were appropriate in the context of the clinical evaluation of agents for the treatment or prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. the primary and secondary outcomes and endpoints of the studies were appropriate and in accordance with advice previously received from chmp. sample size calculations and statistical methods were appropriate, the randomisation schemes appear to be robust and blinding methods are considered satisfactory. for study palo-10-01 the determination of the non-inferiority margin and subsequent sample size calculation was appropriate and in accordance with non-inferiority margins from other cinv trials in the public domain.
</p>
<p>
for study netu-07-07 a sponsor audit of a site in russia presented multiple major audit findings. complete response rates with and without all 39 patients enrolled at this site were consistent with the cr rates from the fas and differences in cr rates did not seem to be systematically in one direction supporting the lack of impact of this site and the overall robustness of the study conclusions.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 116/153 the chmp guidance document for the evaluation of medicinal products for the prevention and treatment of cinv states that patients entering a multiple cycle extension phase of a trial should be re-randomised prior to allocation of treatment to ensure that both treatment arms are balanced. for study netu-08-18, re-randomisation did not occur following enrolment into the multiple-cycle extension (mce)
</p>
<p>
. therefore the applicant was asked to reanalyse this phase. presented results supported the persistence of the antiemetic effect in multiple cycles and are considered satisfactory.

efficacy data and additional analyses  netu 07-07 (hec study)
</header>
<p>
study netu-07-07 evaluated palonosetron alone versus palonosetron plus netupitant 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin-based regimen). all patients also received concomitant dexamethasone. the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete response (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) in the overall phase. results for the primary endpoint showed statistical significance in favour of netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron (p=0.004) with a difference of netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron versus palonosetron alone on the order of 13.2%, which can be considered clinically meaningful. secondary efficacy parameters consistently showed an advantage of the 300 mg netupitant dose compared to lower netupitant doses, particularly in the delayed and overall phases. the percentage of patients in the mfas with delayed cr was 80.1% in the palonosetron alone group and 90.4%, 91.2%, and 90.4% in the netupitant 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg plus palonosetron groups, respectively. differences from palonosetron alone ranged from 10.2% to 11.1%. the logistic regression analysis, including gender as a covariate, showed that all netupitant plus palonosetron doses were statistically superior to palonosetron alone. the contribution of netupitant in the delayed phase (25-120 hour time period) can therefore be considered demonstrated. in addition, a sensitivity analysis done by excluding patients with missing data about emetic episodes/use of rescue medication who were considered as failures in the primary analysis were statistically significant and supported the results of primary analysis (p=0.008), as well as an additional sensitivity analysis with subjects allocated to the actual treatment received (p=0.008). the study was not powered to demonstrate differences in efficacy between the respective netupitant doses. results showed that the 300 mg netupitant dose was statistically superior to palonosetron alone in the acute, delayed and overall period. the 200 and 100 mg netupitant doses were statistically superior to palonosetron alone in the overall and delayed periods only. secondary efficacy parameters consistently showed an advantage of the 300 mg netupitant dose compared to lower netupitant doses, particularly in the delayed and overall phases. additionally the analysis of safety data including treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes), laboratory values, vital signs and 12-lead ecgs in study netu-07-07 did not raise any safety concerns for the administration of palonosetron in combination with netupitant at any of the three dose levels tested.
</p>
<p>
furthermore, there were no increases in severity of aes over the dosing range of 100 mg to 300 mg in netu-07-07 and it is reasonable that the 300 mg dose was carried forward into later clinical trials netu-08-18 and netu-10-29 for confirmation of that finding.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 117/153 in a post-hoc analysis the efficacy of the aprepitant/ondansetron regimen versus the netupitant 300 mg /palonosetron regimen was compared. primary and secondary parameters were analyzed for the overall, acute and delayed phase as an exploratory analysis. the percentage of responders in the netupitant 300 mg arm was numerically higher than the aprepitant/ondansetron for all efficacy endpoints during each phase.

netu-08-18 (mec study)
</header>
<p>
study netu-08-18 evaluated the efficacy of netupitant plus palonosetron (with dexamethasone) versus palonosetron alone (with dexamethasone) in breast cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin). the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with cr in the delayed phase at cycle 1. during the first chemotherapy cycle the percentage of patients in the delayed phase with cr was higher in the combination group (76.9%) than the palonosetron alone group (69.5%), with a difference from the palonosetron alone group of 7.4% which can be considered a clinically relevant difference. the superiority of netupitant/palonosetron to palonosetron alone was demonstrated (cmh or: 1.47 with 95% ci from 1.17 to 1.85; p=0.001). the results of the pp population supported these results. for the key secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients with cr in the acute phase was 3.4% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than in the palonosetron alone group (88.4% vs. 85.0%; from cmh test: or: 1.37, p=0.047) and in the overall phase the cr rate was 7.7% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than in the palonosetron alone group (74.3% vs. 66.6%; from cmh test: or: 1.47, p=0.001). overall, the results of the secondary endpoints consistently supported those of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the delayed and overall phases. in particular, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc group compared with the palonosetron alone group had no emesis in the delayed (81.8% vs. 75.6%; p=0.004), acute (90.9% vs. 87.3%; p=0.025) and overall (79.8% vs. 72.1%; p&lt;0.001) phases. there was a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc group compared with the palonosetron alone group who did not take rescue medication in the delayed (85.8% vs. 80.6%; p=0.007) and overall (84.0% vs. 79.0%; p=0.014) phases, but this difference was not significant in the acute phase.
</p>
<p>
although a slightly higher proportion of patients had no nausea in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc group in the delayed, acute and overall phases, there was no statistically significant difference between the netupitant/palonosetron and the palonosetron groups.
</p>
<p>
however, there was a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc group than in the palonosetron alone group with no significant nausea in the delayed (76.9% vs. 71.3%; p=0.014) and overall (74.6% vs. 69.1%; p=0.020) phases. complete protection rates were statistically significantly higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group compared to the palonosetron group in the delayed (67.3% vs. 60.3%; p=0.005) and overall (63.8% vs. 57.9%; p=0.020) phases, but not in the acute phase.
</p>

, the cr rates were consistently higher for the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than for palonosetron alone in each phase up to cycle 6. similarly, the percentage of patients with no significant nausea was higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group than the palonosetron group in each phase and each cycle up to cycle 6. the impact of nausea and vomiting on patients’ daily lives was assessed using the functional living index–emesis (flie), a validated specific patient-reported outcome measure of the impact of nausea and vomiting on daily life. the proportion of patients with overall no impact on daily life was 6.3% higher (p value =0.005) in the akynzeo group (78.5%) than in the palonosetron group (72.1%).

this study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg compared with i.v. palonosetron 0.25 mg in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint i.e. cr in the acute phase. the two treatment groups showed a similar efficacy profile when considering cr in the delayed and overall phases after administration of hec, and other secondary endpoints in all phases, including, among others, the proportion of patients with no emesis, with no rescue medication, with no nausea or with no significant nausea and the complete protection rate. the data generated were considered supportive for the hec setting.

2.5.4.  conclusions on the clinical efficacy
</header>
<p>
oral administration of akynzeo in combination with dexamethasone has been shown to prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in two separate pivotal studies. results of the pivotal studies show a statistical superiority in terms of acute, overall and, notably, of delayed emesis (endpoint of major clinical interest) of netupitant plus palonosetron over palonosetron alone in cancer patients receiving cisplatin regimen and a combination of anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide regimen. the advantages of this fixed-dose combination [netupitant+palonosetron] include an improvement of the benefit/risk due to an addition of therapeutic activity of the substances, particularly in the delayed phase of emesis.

the study population of 1442 patients with cancer treated with combinations of netupitant (100, 200, and 300 mg) and palonosetron (0.50 mg) in the phase 2/3 studies comprised 401 men (27.8%) and 1041 females (72.2%), was predominantly white (86.0%), and had a mean (sd) age of 54.5 (10.4) years; by age stratification, the majority (82.2%) of treated patients were &lt; 65 years of age. as with the overall safety population, gender differences were largely attributable to those observed in study netu-08-18 (711 females vs 14 males who received the netupitant/palonosetron fdc [300/0.50 mg]). there were no other notable demographic differences between patients who received palonosetron 0.50 mg in combination with netupitant doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg. overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics of patients with cancer in the phase 2/3 studies were well balanced, regardless of palonosetron dose (0.25 mg iv or 0.50 mg po) or 5-ht3 receptor antagonist.

cycle 1
</p>
<p>
during cycle 1 in the phase 2/3 studies, overall 61.7% (2024/3280 patients) reported at least 1 teae. the percent of patients was similar in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (65.5%, 944/1442 patients) and the palonosetron groups (59.1%, 945/1600 patients). in the comparator groups, the overall incidence of patients with at least 1 teae was 56.7% (135/238).
</p>
<p>
throughout the programme teaes were most commonly reported in body systems (soc) that are most often involved with the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy administration. in cycle 1, across the treatment groups, teaes were most commonly reported (&gt; 10%) in the following socs
</p>
<p>
• blood and lymphatic system disorders (21.8%, 716/3280);
</p>
<p>
• skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (19.0%, 624/3280);
</p>
<p>
• gastrointestinal (gi) disorders (15.1%, 496/3280);
</p>
<p>
• general disorders and administration site conditions (14.6%, 478/3280); and
</p>
<p>
• investigations (10.1%, 332/3280)
</p>
<p>
the frequencies of patients reporting teaes in each of these socs were similar across the total (all doses) netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron, and comparator groups, except for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which were reported less frequently in the total comparator group (7.1%, 17/238 patients) than in the total netupitant-palonosetron (22.3%, 321/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (17.9%, 286/1600 patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders, which were also reported less frequently in the total comparator group (13.9%, 33/238 patients) than in the total netupitant-palonosetron (24.5%, 353/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (20.6%, 330/1600 patients).
</p>
<p>
among the patients treated with netupitant-palonosetron, the frequency of patients experiencing at least 1 teae ranged from 40.7% (55/135 patients) in the 100/0.50 mg group to 70.0% (818/1169 patients) in the 300/0.50 mg group. in the palonosetron groups, the frequency of teaes was 51.8% in the 0.25 mg iv group (191/369 patients) and 61.3% in the 0.50 oral group (754/1231 patients).
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 123/153 similarly, the percent of patients with at least 1 teae assessed as being related to study drugs by the investigator was similar in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (9.6%, 138/1442 patients) and the palonosetron groups (6.6%, 105/1600 patients) during cycle 1 in the phase 2/3 studies. in the comparator groups, the percentage of patients with a related teae was 12.2% (29/238). no clear pattern was seen across the netupitant-palonosetron dose groups or between the 2 palonosetron dose groups. the most frequently reported teaes (i.e., those reported by &gt; 5% of patients in any treatment group overall) were alopecia, neutropenia, leukopenia, asthenia, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, and decreased appetite but these events generally occurred in similar percentages of patients across the 3 treatment groups.
</p>
<p>
in the phase 2/3 cancer patients overall, most teaes were of mild (27.4%, 900/3280) or moderate (24.5%, 803/3280) intensity. less than 10% of patients had severe teaes (9.8%, 320/3280) which were mostly caused by chemotherapy toxicity (haematologic disorders and alopecia). the frequency distribution of severity was similar across the treatment groups.
</p>
<p>
as far as drug-related teaes, the only pts that were reported in ≥ 2% of patients overall or in any total treatment group were headache and constipation. headache occurred in 2.2% of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron groups, 2.0% in the palonosetron groups and 1.7% in the aprepitant+palonosetron comparator groups. constipation occurred at a frequency of 1.6% after oral palonosetron and 2.0% after the fdc 300/0.50 mg but was not greater than 2.0% in the overall dose groups.
</p>
<p>
there was no increased incidence of teae or suggestion of accumulated toxicity with repeated dosing.

all cycles considering all cycles in the phase 2/3 studies, the incidence of aes was higher compared to cycle 1 only, as multi-cycle events were added for this analysis. overall, there were 72.3% (2373/3280) of patients with at least 1 teae in all cycles compared to 67.1% (2024/3280 patients) in cycle 1.
</p>
<p>
the percent of patients with teaes was higher in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (78.2%, 1127/1442 patients) than in the palonosetron groups (67.5%, 1080/1600 patients) and in the comparator groups (69.7%, 166/238 patients).
</p>
<p>
the percent of patients with teaes assessed as being related to study drugs by the investigator was similar in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (13.5%, 194/1442 patients) and in the comparator groups (13.4%, 32/238) and lower in the palonosetron groups (8.4%, 134/1600 patients). no clear pattern was seen across the netupitant-palonosetron dose groups or between the 2 palonosetron dose groups. phase 3 multi-cycle studies

<p>
of the 1862 patients in the multi-cycle study safety population, 89.7% (1670/1862) experienced at least 1 teae in the two multi-cycle studies, with a similar frequency across the 3 treatment groups: 90.3% (933/1033 patients) in the netupitant-palonosetron group, 88.6% (642/725 patients) in the palonosetron group, and 91.3% (95/104 patients) in the comparator aprepitant+palonosetron group. overall, 11.7% of patients experienced at least 1 teae assessed as being related to study drugs by the investigator, with higher percentages of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron group (12.7%, 131/1033 patients) and in the palonosetron group (11.2%, 81/725 patients) than in the comparator aprepitant+palonosetron group (5.8%, 6/104 patients). however, the number of patients in the comparator group is small and may therefore not allow a fair comparison.

the overall incidence of serious teaes during cycle 1 of the phase 2/3 studies was 3.8%; 2.3% in the netupitant-palonosetron groups, 5.4% in the palonosetron group, and 1.7% in the aprepitant+5-ht3 group.
</p>
<p>
the most commonly reported events were coded to the system organ classes of blood and lymphatic system disorders (1.2%, overall), gi disorders (0.8%), general disorders and administration site conditions (0.5%), and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (0.5%).
</p>
<p>
by preferred term, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were the most commonly reported serious teaes; these are known to be frequent events associated with the administration of chemotherapy. both of these serious teaes were reported in the palonosetron (0.9% and 0.6% for neutropenia and febrile neutropenia) and netupitant-palonosetron groups (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively), but not in the aprepitant+5-ht3 group.

four patients (&lt; 0.1%) in cycle 1 of the phase 2/3 studies had serious teaes that were considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product: 2 patients in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (events of loss of consciousness and acute psychosis) and 2 patients in the palonosetron group (0.50 mg po; events of abdominal pain and constipation in 1 patient, and diarrhoea and asthenia in 1 patient). all cycles
</p>
<p>
across all cycles of the phase 2/3 studies (including cycle 1, the overall subject incidence of serious teaes was 6.3%, with similar incidences being noted among patients treated with netupitant-palonosetron (6.0%; 87/1442), palonosetron (6.2%; 99/1600), and aprepitant+5-ht3 (8.0%; 19/238). overall, a similar pattern is seen for all cycles compared to cycle 1; serious teaes were most commonly (≥ 1% overall incidence) reported within the system organ classes of blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.1%) and gi disorders (1.3%). by preferred term, the most frequently (≥ 0.5%) reported serious teaes were febrile neutropenia (0.9%), neutropenia (0.8%), and anaemia (0.5%), also consistent with cycle 1 data.
</p>
<p>
in addition to the 4 patients in cycle 1 having serious treatment-related teaes, 1 patient in the netupitant-palonosetron group experienced a treatment-related serious teae before her 6th cycle during the phase 2/3 studies (for a total of 5 patients with related serious teaes during all cycles of the phase 2/3 studies. this patient experienced ventricular extrasystoles judged by the investigator to have a probable causal relationship with investigational product. phase 3 multi-cycle studies
</p>
<p>
all cycles
</p>
<p>
the overall subject incidence of saes was 6.9% across all cycles of the phase 3 multi-cycle program, with saes being reported more frequently for patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group (18.3%) than in the netupitant-palonosetron (8.2%) or palonosetron groups (3.3%). in general, the most common saes were categorised within the system organ classes of blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.1% netupitant-palonosetron; 1.1% palonosetron; 4.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), gi disorders (1.8% netupitant-palonosetron; 0.3% palonosetron; 3.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), and infections and infestations (1.5% netupitant-palonosetron; 0.7% palonosetron; 3.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), consistent with those expected for a population of patients with cancer receiving multicycle chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
by preferred term, the most common saes (≥ 0.3% overall) observed in patients were febrile neutropenia (1.2%), neutropenia (0.7%), vomiting (0.4%), anaemia (0.4%), and leucopenia (0.3%). in the netupitant-palonosetron and palonosetron groups, febrile neutropenia was the most frequently reported sae (1.5% [16/1033] and 0.8% [6/725], respectively), while anaemia was the most frequently reported sae among patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group (2.9%; 3/104). for other individual preferred terms, there did not appear to be a pattern observed with respect to the types of saes that were reported with greater subject incidence, and the low incidence of each of these saes across treatment groups precludes meaningful comparison.

deaths
</header>
<p>
of the 3280 patients in the 4 key phase 2/3 studies in patients with cancer, 39 patients (1.2%) died on-study. none of the deaths was considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product, with most of the deaths being attributable to disease-related progression or to complications due the toxic effects of chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
in the phase 2/3 studies, 28 patients (0.9%) died during cycle 1, and 11 patients died during the remaining chemotherapy cycles, as follows:
</p>
<p>
• in cycle 1, of the 28 patients who died, 20 patients out of 1600 (1.3%) had received either iv or oral palonosetron (19 were treated in single-cycle study palo-10-01 and 1 in study netu-08-18); 8 patients (of 1442 [0.6%]) had received netupitant-palonosetron
</p>
<p>
and
</p>
<p>
no subjects in the aprepitant+5-ht3 group had a fatal teae during cycle 1.
</p>
<p>
• during the remaining cycles (i.e., patients in the phase 3 multi-cycle studies), 19 patients died (of 1862 patients treated during the multi-cycle studies [1.0%]). there did not appear to be an influence of repeated dosing on the incidence of fatal adverse events, as the overall incidence of adverse events resulting in death was similar across chemotherapy cycles (range of incidences: 0.1% [cycle 2 and cycle 4] to 0.4% [cycle 1 and cycle 6]). overall, for patients in the phase 3 multi-cycle studies, the incidence of fatal teaes (across all cycles, 1 through 6) was generally comparable across treatment groups: teaes resulting in death were experienced by 1.5% of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron group, 0.3% of patients in the palonosetron group, and 1.0% of patients in aprepitant+palonosetron group.
</p>
<p>
in addition to the deaths reported above, there were 5 patients in study netu-10-29 who experienced teaes with a final fatal outcome, but who were not included in the data as on-study deaths: 3 of these patients (2 in the netupitant-palonosetron group and 1 in the aprepitant+5-ht3 group) died after completion of all chemotherapy cycles to which they were scheduled (i.e., these patients, per protocol, were considered to have completed study); 1 patient withdrew from the study due to an ae (which ultimately had a fatal outcome); and 1 patient withdrew from the study due to other reasons (investigator assessment: worsening of global health condition) and died a few days after discontinuation.
</p>
<p>
of the remaining patients in the netupitant-palonosetron clinical development programme (i.e., healthy volunteers and patients in special population studies), 2 died on-study. both were cancer patients treated with the netupitant/palonosetron fdc (300/0.50 mg) prior to docetaxel chemotherapy in drug-interaction study netu-10-09. neither death was assessed by the investigator as being related to netupitant/palonosetron fdc. in the first case, the patient (81-year-old male with prostate cancer) was hospitalised because of dehydration, neutropenia, and pneumonia, and died following circulatory and respiratory insufficiency associated with pneumonia. the events were considered to be related (possibly and definitely) to docetaxel. in the second case, the patient (a 63-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma) was hospitalised after experiencing respiratory failure with dyspnoea, and later died after developing severe neutropenia (nonserious) and pulmonary oedema. the death was attributed to progression of lung cancer, and was not considered to be related to docetaxel or to investigational product.
</p>
<p>
the most frequent preferred terms in the phase 2/3 patients who died during the phase 2/3 studies (n=39) were multi-organ failure (5 patients), death (4 patients), acute cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, pneumonia and renal failure (3 patients each). there were 17 deaths in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (17/1442), 21 deaths in palonosetron-treated groups (21/1600; of which 9/1231 in the palonosetron oral group) and 1 death in the active comparator groups (1/238).

<p>
routine laboratory tests included haematology and chemistry at screening, day 2 and day 6 of each cycle during the phase 3 multi-cycle studies. troponin concentrations (ctni) were measured at the same time points in the two multi-cycle phase 3 studies.
</p>
<p>
as expected, in patients receiving chemotherapy over multiple cycles, leucopenia (including neutropenia, monocytopenia and granulocytopenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia were observed with generally similar reductions in patients receiving netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron or aprepitant+palonosetron. there was no apparent influence of repeat exposure to investigational product on haematology parameters. no clinically meaningful differences in haematology were observed between the treatment groups after both single cycle and multiple cycle exposure.
</p>
<p>
during all cycles, the most frequently reported (&gt; 5.0% overall) marked laboratory abnormalities among subjects in the netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron, and aprepitant+palonosetron groups were hyperglycaemia (8.4%, 7.6%, and 6.7%, respectively) and hyponatraemia (5.5%, 6.3%, and 6.7%). hyperglycaemia was reported as a teae for 119 (of 1862 [6.4%]) patients in the phase 3 multi-cycle studies (6.1% of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron group; 7.3% of patients in the palonosetron group; and 2.9% of patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group).

as of the cut-off date of 30 june 2013, two cases of exposed pregnancy occurred during the fdc development program. one female healthy volunteer treated with 600 mg netupitant and 1.50 mg palonosetron (study netu-07-20) had a positive serum pregnancy test at the final visit. the entire gestation was uneventful and the woman gave birth to a normal newborn. the second subject was treated with the fdc (300/0.50 mg) in a bioequivalence study (netu-11-02). the pregnancy was uneventful, delivery was without complications, and the newborn was healthy.

vital signs included the monitoring of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate and were measured at screening for each cycle plus pre-dose, 5, 24, and 120 hours post-dose at each cycle.
</p>
<p>
after the start of chemotherapy, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were slightly lower in all treatment groups during cycle 1 compared to baseline; however, these changes were not clinically meaningful. there were no patterns or trends over time in vital signs during the phase 3 multi-cycle studies, and none of the results appeared to be indicative of a clinical concern. there was little variability in mean blood pressure values over time.

safety in special populations

<p>
for the multi-cycle phase 3 studies, patients with varying degrees of renal impairment were evaluated for safety including teaes, serious teaes, and ecgs. in addition teaes and serious teaes are further analysed by the intrinsic factors of gender, age class, race, and region. the extrinsic factor of emetogenicity (i.e., hec and mec) is analysed using both the phase 2/3 cancer patient population and the multi-cycle phase 3 patients.

renal impairment
</header>
<p>
per protocol patients were qualified for enrolment provided that serum creatinine was equal to or less than 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance was ≥ 60 ml/min. the multi-cycle phase 3 studies did not enrol patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) and included more patients with normal renal function ([creatinine clearance ≥ 90 ml/min] 1198/1862, 64.3%) than patients with either mild renal impairment ([creatinine clearance ≥ 60 to &lt; 90 ml/min] 580/1862, 31.1%) or moderate renal impairment ([creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to &lt; 60 ml/min] 80/1862, 4.3%). this difference is consistently seen in all the treatment groups: in the netupitant-palonosetron group there are 668 normal renal function patients, 317 mild renal impairment patients, and 45 moderate renal impairment patients; in the palonosetron group the patients are 476, 218, and 30, respectively; and in the aprepitant+palonosetron group they are 54, 45, and 5, respectively. no clear difference was observed in the incidence of teaes or ecg parameters for patients with normal renal function compared to those of patients with mild and moderate renal impairment in the phase 3 multicycle studies.
</p>
<p>
the percentage of patients with at least 1 teae was similar in the 3 renal function subgroups for each treatment group, with the most commonly reported teaes in each subgroup reflecting those in the overall safety population. in addition, the percentage of cycles during which patients experienced any teae was similar across the renal function subgroups for each treatment group.
</p>
<p>
changes in ecgs during the phase 3 multicentre studies were small and generally larger in the mild and moderate renal impairment subgroups than in patients with normal renal function although the small number of patients in the moderate renal impairment subgroup makes comparison difficult. few patients had outlier

gender
</header>
<p>
the multi-cycle phase 3 studies included more female patients (1628/1862, 87.4%) than male patients (234/1862, 12.6%). this imbalance is mainly driven by the safety population in study netu-08-18 (which compared netupitant-palonosetron and palonosetron) which was primarily comprised of females (1422/1450, 98.1%), with a minority (28/1450, 1.9%) of males, due to the protocol-specified chemotherapy regimen (mec, ac/ec) mostly indicated for breast cancer. as a consequence, this difference is seen in both the netupitant-palonosetron group (866 females, 167 males) and the palonosetron group (711 females, 14 males), while the aprepitant+palonosetron group, which comprises patients from study netu-10-29 only, had a similar number of females (51) and males (53).
</p>
<p>
the percentage of patients with at least 1 teae considering all cycles was slightly lower in the male subgroup than the female subgroup overall (85.5% and 90.3%, respectively), with the most commonly reported teaes in males and in females reflecting those in the overall safety population.

the multi-cycle phase 3 studies included more patients with &lt; 65 years (1519/1862, 81.6%) than patients with ≥ 65 year (343/1862, 18.4%). as detailed below, the percentage of patients with at least 1 teae during any cycle was comparable in the subgroups of patients &lt; 65 years of age and patients ≥ 65 years of age overall (89.3%, 1356/1519 patients and 91.5%, 314/343 patients, respectively) and in the netupitant-palonosetron group (89.3%, 749/839 patients vs. 94.8%, 184/194 patients, respectively), with the most commonly reported teaes in each of the 2 age subgroups reflecting those in the overall safety population. almost all the patients included in the multi-cycle phase 3 studies were &lt; 75 years (1821/1862, 97.8%) and only a minority (41/1862, 2.2%) was ≥ 75 years of age. therefore, the number of patients in the subgroup ≥ 75 years of age was too small to allow a meaningful comparison with the other group.

emetogenicity
</header>
<p>
the percentage of patients with at least 1 teae overall was higher in the mec subgroup than in the hec subgroup during cycle 1 and all cycles both overall and in each of the treatment groups. it should be noted that for the “all cycles” population, where the difference is observed as well, the hec subgroup (1518 patients) is comprised of 1418 patients from netu-07-07 and palo-10-01 (cycle 1 only). in the analysis of cycles with teaes, the percentage of cycles during which patients experienced any teae was higher in mec patients than hec patients in each treatment group. within each subgroup (mec and hec), no differences were seen between the treatment groups in the proportion of patients with teaes.
</p>
<p>
the differences in the types and incidence of teaes between the mec and hec subgroups are considered to reflect the differences between the chemotherapy regimens and potentially the mix of patients (primarily women in the mec-ac group) in these subgroups. the difference in the incidence of events in cycle 1 may be partially explained by the difference in the toxicity pattern of the mec and hec regimens, with mec mainly affecting the bone marrow with a nadir between 7-14 days post chemotherapy, while hec toxicity primarily targets the kidney and has a cumulative effect on renal function. also in cycle 1, the incidence of alopecia may have contributed to the difference between the mec and hec subgroups, being reported in cycle 1 by 31% of mec patients and 1.5% of hec patients, and may reflect the different proportion of female patients receiving an ac-based regimen for breast cancer, known to cause greater incidence of more severe chemotherapy-induced alopecia compared with cisplatin.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 138/153 the percentage of patients with serious teaes, however, is higher in the hec subgroup than in the mec subgroup in cycle 1 (5.4% vs 2.4%) and similar in the 2 subgroups in all cycles (6.1% and 6.4%). this suggests that in cycle 1 hec patients reported fewer teaes, but they experienced more serious events.

ecg
</header>
<p>
for cycle 1 in the phase 2/3 cancer patients, an analysis of ecg data showed that at 5 hours after treatment (approximate tmax for netupitant/palonosetron fdc), a comparable increase from baseline in qtcf was seen in the netupitant-palonosetron group, the palonosetron group, and the comparator group. similar changes from baseline in qtcf values were also observed at 24 hours post dose with mean qtcf values returning to baseline values or lower at 120 hours after treatment. at subsequent cycles, in the multi-cycle studies a similar pattern was observed, with comparable changes from the same-cycle pre-dose reference values for each treatment group.
</p>
<p>
an outlier analysis showed that the proportion of patients with qtcf increases from baseline to &gt;500 ms was low in the netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron and comparator groups in cycle 1 of the phase 2/3 studies. in the multi-cycle studies, considering all cycles, the percentage of patients who had new qtcf interval values &gt; 500 ms was low and comparable between treatment groups (1.1% in the netupitant-palonosetron group, 0.8% in the palonosetron group, and 1.0% in the comparator group). moreover, the proportion of patients with qtcf increases of &gt;60 ms from baseline or same cycle pre-dose was also low and comparable in the netupitant-palonosetron group and in the palonosetron at each cycle. the lower proportion of patients with qtcf increases of &gt; 60 ms in the comparator arm is likely related to the reduced pro-arrhythmic potential of the chemotherapeutic agents used in study netu-10-29. no increased risk of clinically relevant qt prolongation is expected after the administration of netupitant/palonosetron fdc.
</p>
<p>
outlier responses in qtc interval are difficult to assess in view of normal intra-individual and circadian variability in this parameter. recommended assessment criteria that could indicate a potential safety signal include a change in qtcf from baseline to &gt; 500 msec in more than 5% of patients and from baseline of &gt; 60 msec in more than 15% of patients (morganroth et al. 2010). in cycle 1, the percentage of patients with new treatment-emergent ecg abnormalities after baseline was comparable between the treatment groups (37.5%, 37.4%, and 39.1% in the netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron, and aprepitant +palonosetron groups, respectively). the most frequently reported new treatment-emergent ecg abnormalities were flat t-wave (11.3% overall) followed by sinus tachycardia (9.2% overall), both of which occurred in similar percentages of patients across the treatment groups. in the subgroup of patients who received at least 6 consecutive cycles of the same treatment in the phase 3 multicycle studies, the overall frequency of new treatment-emergent ecg abnormalities tended to increase by cycle in the netupitant-palonosetron group and the palonosetron group from cycle 1 (36.6% [116/317 patients] and 40.3% [77/191 patients], respectively) to cycle 5 (50.8% [161/317 patients] and 52.4% [100/191 patients], respectively). the frequency of new u-waves was low (0.50%) and comparable across the treatment groups.
</p>
<p>
study netu-07-20 was a double-blind randomised parallel-group trial to investigate possible ecg effects of single oral doses of netupitant/palonosetron using a clinical and a supratherapeutic dose compared to placebo and moxifloxacin (a positive control) in healthy men and women (a thorough qt study).
</p>
<p>
the objective of the study was to demonstrate that the administration of netupitant in combination with palonosetron does not prolong the qt interval more than placebo in male and female healthy subjects.
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 139/153 subjects were males and females between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive), in good physical health, and with a body mass index ≥19 and &lt;29 kg/m2.
</p>
<p>
the study was conducted in compliance of ich e14 guidance and the primary endpoint was to determine the effect of the combination on qtc interval as corrected by individually derived heart rate correction factor.
</p>
<p>
there were 4 treatment groups:
</p>
<p>
1. placebo to netupitant and placebo to palonosetron
</p>
<p>
2. 200 mg netupitant and 0.50 mg palonosetron
</p>
<p>
3. 600 mg netupitant and 1.50 mg palonosetron
</p>
<p>
4. 400 mg moxifloxacin
</p>
<p>
the time matched analysis for the qtci endpoint revealed that the moxifloxacin group met the assay sensitivity criteria with 12 time points &gt; mean of 5 msec. the time matched results for qtci, qtcf and qtcb showed that at no time point did palonosetron and netupitant dose groups exceed the upper confidence interval of 10 msec. as far as the effect on qtci interval is concerned, the changes observed were considered to be random changes consistent with spontaneous variability in qtc interval and not to indicate a pharmacological effect due to the administration of netupitant/palonosetron combination. this conclusion was supported by a lack of dose-response or concentration-response relationship and overall, the results of this ecg trial showed no signal of any effect on av conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the pr and qrs interval durations. no statistical or experimental evidence was found to demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected qt interval or qt intervals with plasma palonosetron concentrations after single dose administration of intravenous palonosetron including supratherapeutic doses up to 2.25 mg, 9-fold greater than the current marketed 0.25 mg intravenous dose. the expert cardiologist notes that following the first cycle, mean increases in qtc intervals at 5 hours and 24 hours were very small (&lt; 12 msec) and within normal limits. these increases were comparable for the three treatments administered (namely, the fdc, palonosetron alone or a comparator combination). the number of outliers with significant categorical responses (qtc interval &gt; 500 msec or an increase from baseline of &gt; 60 msec) was very low (maximum 0.6%) and consistent with what would be observed normally in such populations.

<p>
the applicant performed an analysis for netupitant-palonosetron to cause severe liver toxicity (dili) to assess the potential of hepatotoxic signals induced by patients’ exposure to treatment. such an analysis of the potential was undertaken in the phase 3 multi-cycle clinical trials. overall, the analysis of all cases described in an expert review indicated that exposure to netupitant and palonosetron was not associated with the development of severe liver injury. the diagnostic profile was mainly represented by mild hepatocellular liver injury. all patients recovered or improved and no patients discontinued the study because of hepatoxicity. the main confounding factor in the occurrence of liver events is chemotherapy, which represents a known cause of liver injury. data from the fdc development program do not suggest a particular risk of hepatotoxicity associated with netupitant-palonosetron fdc exposure after single or repeated cycles of chemotherapy.

safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
</header>
<p>
netupitant is a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome p450 isoenzyme 3a4 (cyp3a4). studies have shown that when a cyp3a4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) was administered with netupitant, approximately 2-fold increases in netupitant exposure were observed. likewise, coadministration of a cyp3a4 inducer (rifampicin) resulted in a 5- to 6-fold reduction in netupitant exposure (netu-10-11).
</p>
<p>
based on pharmacokinetic interaction studies performed during the development program, administration of the fdc with cyp3a4 substrates may result in increased exposure to the substrate. exposure to midazolam, erythromycin, dexamethasone, docetaxel, etoposide, and levonorgestrel were all increased during coadministration with netupitant. these additional studies indicate that netupitant is a mild to moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4 (np16599, netu-06-07, netu-10-08, netu-10-09).
</p>
<p>
the pk of netupitant was not affected by cyp3a4 substrates erythromycin, midazolam, dexamethasone, or oral contraceptives. furthermore, mean netupitant pk parameters obtained in each of the 3 chemotherapy groups (administered with docetaxel, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide) after netupitant/palonosetron fdc co-administration were not essentially different.
</p>
<p>
netupitant does not influence the exposure of digoxin, a p-glycoprotein substrate (netu-07-01). nevertheless a slight increase of digoxin cmax (9%) was observed. netupitant also has no effect on the pk of palonosetron (netu-06-27).

2.6.1.  discussion on clinical safety
</header>
<p>
clinical safety was assessed through the 4 pivotal studies that were performed in the target population: prevention of cinv in patient receiving hec or mec. the study population was predominantly white (86.0%), and had a mean (sd) age of 54.5 (10.4) years. a total of 1538 subjects and patients were exposed to the netupitant-palonosetron combination at the proposed market dose (300/0.50 mg) during the clinical programme with a total number of 5441 exposures: 1169 patients with cancer received at least one dose while participating in one of the phase 2/3 studies. there were 550 patients who received 6 or more consecutive cycles of chemotherapy and 317 of these received the fdc (300/0.50 mg). adverse reactions were compared across netupitant-palonosetron (1442 patients) and palonosetron (1600 patients) and comparator groups (238). common adverse reactions reported with akynzeo were headache (3.6%), constipation (3.0%) and fatigue (1.2%).
</p>
<p>
none of these events was serious. the frequency of headache, constipation and fatigue was similar (2.9%, 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively) in patients receiving oral palonosetron 0.5 mg alone. cases of severe constipation and of complications due to constipation were observed in the clinical trials and, in accordance with the product information on aloxi (palonosetron), information included in the smpc and in the rmp as an important identified risk.
</p>
<p>
for cycle 1, the frequencies of patients reporting teaes were similar across the total (all doses) netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron, and comparator groups, except for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which were reported less frequently in the total comparator group (7.1%, 17/238 patients) than in the total netupitant-palonosetron (22.3%, 321/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (17.9%, 286/1600 patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders, which were also reported less frequently in the total comparator group (13.9%, 33/238 patients) than in the total netupitant-palonosetron (24.5%, 353/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (20.6%, 330/1600 patients). whereas the incidence of certain adverse reactions such as leucopenia or alopecia seemed to increased with dose of the fdc in the phase 2/3 combined safety population for cycle 1 this could not be shown in study netu-07-07 where frequency and severity of teaes were comparable across treatment groups without indication of dose-dependence. it is acknowledged that, unlike in the combined safety population netu-07-07 study included similar numbers and types of cancer patients at each netupitant dose level but, considering that netupitant is a known cyp3a4 inhibitor
</p>
<p>
precautionary statements were included into the smpc to monitor patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for cyp3a4 for possible increased toxicity. sae profiles shown in the clinical trial programme were consistent with the patient population and the fact that they were undergoing chemotherapy. the overall subject incidence of saes was 6.9% across all cycles of the phase 3 multi-cycle programme, with saes being reported more frequently for patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group (18.3%) than in the netupitant-palonosetron (8.2%) or palonosetron groups (3.3%). in general, the most common saes were categorised within the system organ classes of blood and
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 144/153 lymphatic system disorders (3.1% netupitant-palonosetron; 1.1% palonosetron; 4.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), gi disorders (1.8% netupitant-palonosetron; 0.3% palonosetron; 3.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), and infections and infestations (1.5% netupitant-palonosetron; 0.7% palonosetron; 3.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), all of which might be seen in a population of patients with cancer receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. by preferred term, the most common saes (≥ 0.3% overall) observed in patients were febrile neutropenia (1.2%), neutropenia (0.7%), vomiting (0.4%), anaemia (0.4%), and leucopenia (0.3%). in the netupitant-palonosetron and palonosetron groups, febrile neutropenia was the most frequently reported sae (1.5% [16/1033] and 0.8% [6/725], respectively). a total of 46 cancer patients who participated in the clinical development programme died; 41 deaths occurred during the treatment period (39 in the phase 2/3 trials and 2 in the pk interaction study); 5 patients died after their participation in study netu-10-29. none of the deaths was considered related to study medication. both the frequency and the nature of deaths are considered consistent with what would be expected in the population enrolled and with disease related progression or complications of cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
leucopenia (including neutropenia, monocytopenia and granulocytopenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia were observed with generally similar reductions in patients receiving netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron or aprepitant+palonosetron. there was no apparent influence of repeat exposure to investigational product on haematology parameters. no clinically meaningful differences in haematology were observed between the treatment groups after both single cycle and multiple cycle exposure. there were no obvious trends indicative of treatment-related effects on chemistry parameters across all treatment groups. there was a low incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events. overall, seventy-seven (2.3%) patients reported teaes during any chemotherapy cycle of the phase 2/3 studies that led to withdrawal from the study, a total of 44 patients in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (3.1%), 20 in the palonosetron group (1.3%) and 13 (5.5%) in the aprepitant+5-ht3 group. the adverse events causing withdrawal is considered to reflect the condition being treated and the adverse events of associated chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>
subgroup analyses based on renal function, age, gender, race, region and emetogenicity (hec or mec) did not reveal any statistically significant differences that would require special consideration. adverse event profiles across the subgroups evaluated reflected those in the overall safety population. the percentage of patients with at least one teae overall was higher in the mec subgroup compared to hec during cycle 1 and all cycles both overall and in each of the treatment groups and it is agreed that this may reflect the different toxicities of chemotherapy regimens.
</p>
<p>
a thorough ecg trial demonstrated that netupitant and palonosetron had no clinically important effects on heart rate, pr and qrs interval duration or cardiac morphology. the effects on cardiac repolarization by any of the ecg data analyses including a careful pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic analysis also showed no netupitant/palonosetron effects on cardiac repolarization. no statistical or experimental evidence was found to demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected qt interval or qt intervals with plasma palonosetron concentrations after single dose administration of intravenous palonosetron including supratherapeutic doses up to 2.25 mg, 9-fold greater than the current marketed 0.25 mg intravenous dose. following the first cycle, mean increases in qtc intervals at 5 hours and 24 hours were very small (&lt; 12 msec) and within normal limits. these increases were comparable for the three treatments administered (namely, the fdc, palonosetron alone or a comparator combination). the number of outliers with significant
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 145/153 categorical responses (qtc interval &gt; 500 msec or an increase from baseline of &gt; 60 msec) was very low (maximum 0.6%) and consistent with what would be observed normally in such populations.
</p>
<p>
nevertheless the magnitude of the qt prolongation observed (5 to 7 ms in healthy volunteers) might translate into more profound effects in patients vomiting, with diarrhoea, treated with other drugs susceptible to increase qt interval, with cardiac conditions (heart failure…) or similar problems which decrease their repolarisation reserve. therefore, as with other 5ht3 receptor antagonists a precautionary statement was in included into section 4.4 of the smpc and identified as a potential risk in the risk management plan. in vitro data demonstrated that netupitant is a p-gp inhibitor. in a study performed in healthy volunteers, netupitant did not affect the exposure of digoxin, a p-gp substrate, whereas it significantly increases its cmax (by 9%).clinically this effect may be relevant notably in female patients in whom the therapeutic margin for digoxin is narrower than in men. furthermore, netupitant will be administered to patients the renal status of whom would be probably altered either due to the age and/or to chemotherapy (e.g.cisplatin). as it cannot be ruled out that digoxin exposure may increase in a significant manner in the clinical setting a precautionary statement to the use of p-gp substrates was implemented in the smpc and this was added as an important potential risk due to netupitant into the rmp. based on the current smpc, palonosetron is not expected to be an inhibitor and an inducer of cyps. however, since the granting of the ma for palonosetron, a new eu guideline on drug-drug interactions was published (cpmp/ewp/560/95/rev. 1; came into effect january 2013). the investigation of the involvement of efflux and uptake transporters in the interaction profile of a new drug entity is now strongly recommended. no data of such feature was submitted therefore the applicant is recommended to carry out an additional in vitro study evaluating the involvement of efflux and uptake transporters in palonosetron disposition and its effect as an inhibitor of these transporters by the end of march 2016. from the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the summary of product characteristics.

<p>
overall, the fdc was well tolerated. many adverse reactions are likely to be associated with either the underlying condition or associated cytotoxic therapies. similarly saes and deaths reflect the patient population and concurrent treatment. the known pk interaction of netupitant with cyp3a4, which might be associated with an increase in the exposure to chemotherapy agents metabolised via this pathway is adequately addressed in smpc and rmp.

within a pivotal study with cancer patients receiving cisplatin based regimen (netu-07-07) the applicant could show for the primary endpoint “proportion of patients with complete response in the overall phase” statistical superiority in favour of netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron (p=0.004). the difference versus oral palonosetron 0.5 mg alone, which is already marketed in the eu, ranked in the order of 13.2%, which can be considered clinically meaningful. the percentage of patients in the mfas with delayed cr was 80.1% in the palonosetron alone group and 90.4% in the netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron group. the contribution of netupitant in the 25-120 hour time period (delayed phase) can therefore be considered demonstrated. in the second pivotal study (netu-08-18) evaluating the efficacy of netupitant plus palonosetron versus palonosetron alone in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin the primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of patients with cr in the delayed phase at cycle 1) during the first chemotherapy cycle was higher in the combination group (76.9%) than the palonosetron alone group (69.5%), with a difference from the palonosetron alone group of 7.4% which can be considered a clinically relevant difference. the superiority of netupitant/palonosetron to palonosetron alone was demonstrated (cmh or: 1.47 with 95% ci from 1.17 to 1.85; p=0.001). key secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients with cr in the acute phase was 3.4% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than in the palonosetron alone group (88.4% vs. 85.0%; from cmh test: or: 1.37, p=0.047) and in the overall phase the cr rate was 7.7% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than in the palonosetron alone group (74.3% vs. 66.6%; from cmh test: or: 1.47, p=0.001). in general, the results of the secondary endpoints consistently supported those of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the delayed and overall phases. the multiple-cycle extension phase confirmed these results showing cr rates being consistently higher for the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than for palonosetron alone in each phase up to cycle 6. similarly, the percentage of patients with no significant nausea was higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group than the palonosetron group in each phase and each cycle up to cycle 6.

the pivotal efficacy trial in the mec setting (netu-08-18) almost exclusively recruited patents with a diagnosis of breast cancer treated with an anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (ac). recently clinical antiemetic guidelines have given special consideration to patient-related risk factors contributing to the emetogenic potential for patients receiving ac-based chemotherapy rather than solely based on the
</p>
<p>
ema/236963/2015 page 150/153 emetogenicity of the chemotherapy. the young age and female gender of the population that typically received ac-based chemotherapy may put this group at an increased risk for cinv over what ac chemotherapy alone would suggest. nevertheless it is taken into consideration by the chmp that ac chemotherapy has previously served as gold standard of the mec regimen in antiemetic efficacy pivotal trials’ being a “worst-case” emetogenicity representative for mec chemotherapy and this model is considered to be familiar to clinicians for use to prevent cinv induced by mec. the indication in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in mec is therefore considered to be appropriately supported by this clinical trial. nevertheless relevant information for the prescriber about regimen and study population of this trial was included into the smpc to highlight this extrapolation of efficacy results.

the fdc demonstrated teratogenic potential in animals showing an increased incidence of some foetal malformations. considering that alternative treatment options are available, the use of akynzeo during pregnancy was contraindicated and teratogenicity added as a potential risk to the rmp. furthermore women with childbearing potential must use effective contraception during use of akynzeo as described in the smpc. almost all patients included in the multi-cycle phase 3 studies were &lt; 75 years (1821/1862, 97.8%) and only a minority (41/1862, 2.2%) was ≥ 75 years of age. since also hepatic impairment led to a longer half-life of the active substances and since in elderly subjects the exposure to netupitant and palonosetron was increased compared to younger adults, precautionary statements on the limited experience in this patient population were added to the smpc.
</p>
<p>
netupitant increased exposure to docetaxel (increased auc 0-t by 37% and c max by 50%). exposure was also increased to a lesser extent for etoposide (auc0-t 21%, no change in cmax). for cyclophosphamide mean increase in exposure ranged from 8 to 14%. as increased chemotherapy toxicities following administration of netupitant cannot be completely ruled out with orally administered active substances that are metabolised primarily through cyp3a4 and with a narrow therapeutic range precautionary statements for possible increased toxicity were added to the product information to monitor patients for increased toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for cyp3a4.

benefit-risk balance importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
</header>
<p>
nausea and vomiting are among the side effects associated with cancer treatment. if nausea and vomiting are not controlled in a cancer patient, serious metabolic problems such as fluid and electrolyte balance disturbances and nutritional status deficiencies can develop. psychological problems associated with nausea and vomiting may include anxiety and depression. in addition, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting may also lead to the decision by the physician to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to the wish by the patient to stop potentially beneficial cancer therapy. the applicant showed within a pivotal study with cancer patients receiving hec clinical meaningful results of the fdc compared to palonosetron alone in the proportion of patients with complete response in the overall and delayed phase. the additional action of netupitant in particular on the delayed phase was demonstrated. in a second study in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin the percentage of patients with cr in the delayed phase at cycle 1 was 7.4% higher for the fdc compared to palonosetron alone giving proof of efficacy in mec. efficacy results were generaly supported by the seconday enpoints. the multiple-cycle extension phase confirmed these results showing cr rates being consistently higher for the netupitant/palonosetron fdc than for palonosetron alone in each phase up to cycle 6.
</p>
<p>
unfavourable effects observed in the clinical trials mainly reflected toxicities of the concurrent chemotherapy and no significant or unexpected adverse reactions related to the fdc were noted.

<p>
the data from the clinical development programme indicate that akynzeo is effective in reducing the incidence of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly- and moderately- emetogenic chemotherapy, notwithstanding the recent changes to the classification ac based chemotherapy regimens. efficacy was maintained when used in subsequent chemotherapy cycles. akynzeo showed a favourable safety profile with unfavourable effects and uncertainties thereof being balanced with the implemented wordings in the product information.

discussion on the benefit-risk balance
</header>
<p>
the applicant could demonstrate in two separate pivotal studies efficacy of oral administration of the fdc netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg to prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. results of the pivotal studies show a statistical superiority notably in terms of delayed emesis (primary endpoint) of netupitant plus palonosetron over palonosetron alone in cancer patients receiving cisplatin regimen and a combination of anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide regimen. clinical practice guidelines in oncology recommend that patients receiving hec regimens or mec regimens with anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide should be treated with a combination of a 5-ht3 ra, nk1 ra and a systemic corticosteroid. the advantages of this fixed-dose combination include an improvement of the benefit/risk due to an addition of therapeutic activity of the substances particularly in the delayed phase of emesis. simplification of therapy
