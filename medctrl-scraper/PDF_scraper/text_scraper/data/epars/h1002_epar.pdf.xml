problem statement

<p>
differentiated thyroid cancinoma (dtc) thyroid cancer is rare, representing less than 1% of all cancers (hundahl, et al., 1998; pacini, et al., 2012; tuttle, et al., 2010). there are three main histologic types of thyroid carcinoma: differentiated, medullary, and anaplastic. differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) is the most common of all thyroid cancers accounting for approximately 90% to 95% of cases (hundahl, et al., 1998). it arises from follicular epithelial cells. based on histological appearance, dtcs are designated as either papillary (≈80%), follicular (≈10%), or hürthle cell (≈5%). hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma is currently considered as an oncocytic variant of follicular carcinoma. the remaining 5% to 10% are either c cell-derived medullary (mtc) or anaplastic (atc) thyroid carcinomas. prognosis and treatment in general, prognosis for thyroid cancer at the time of diagnosis is good, with a 5 year relative survival rate of 98% (seer cancer statistics review, 2014) and a 10-year survival rate of 85% (hundahl, et al., 1998). up to 10-15% would either present with distant metastasis at diagnosis or develop them after initial treatment. distant metastases are associated with 5-year survival rates of approximately 50% (schlumberger et al., 1986; seer cancer statistics review, 2014), 10-year survival rates of 40% (schlumberger et al., 1986), and 15 year survival rates of 30% (schlumberger et al., 1986; schlumberger et al., 1996).
</p>
<p>
differentiated thyroid cancer is usually asymptomatic for long periods and commonly presents as a solitary thyroid nodule. first-line treatment for primary management of dtc is surgery (total thyroidectomy or unilateral lobectomy), often followed by radioiodine (131i) ablation and thyroxine therapy (european society of medical oncology guidelines, pacini, et al, 2012). the goals of this treatment strategy are to destroy any residual thyroid tissue and prevent locoregional recurrence. external beam radiotherapy may be indicated when complete surgical excision is not possible or when there is no significant uptake in the tumor (pacini et al, 2012). only 30% of patients with distant metastasis respond to radioiodine therapy with complete remission (schlumberger, et al., 1999). tumor recurrence occurs in 3-25% of patients with dtc, depending
</p>
<p>
on histology and tumor extension at diagnosis, with a median follow-up period of 16.6 years, 16% had local recurrence and 8% had distant metastases (which includes 2% with both local and distant metastases) (mazzaferri and kloos, 2001).
</p>
<p>
of the 5-20% who develop locoregional recurrences, approximately two-thirds involve cervical lymph nodes. distant metastases in lung, bones and brain occur in up to 10% of patients and are associated with a
</p>
<p>
ema/250082/2015
</p>
<p>
page 11/169
</p>
<p>
median survival of 5 years from the time of discovery of metastases (schlumberger, et al., 1986; seer cancer statistics review, 2014). approximately one-third of metastatic dtcs lose the functional ability to concentrate iodine and no longer respond to radioiodine (131i) treatment (schlumberger, et al., 1996, durante, et al., 2006). upon the absence or loss of 131i uptake, tumors assume a more aggressive behavior, resulting in a 10-year survival rate of approximately 10% (schlumberger et al., 1996; durante et al.,2006). single-agent or combination chemotherapy in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc) offers patients little to no benefit, is associated with significant toxicity and is no longer indicated (haugen and sherman, 2013, shimaoka, et al., 1985; matuszczyk, et al., 2008; pacini et al, 2012). current clinical consensus guidelines recommend that patients with rr-dtc avoid traditional chemotherapy and move directly to treatment with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) in clinical trials (american thyroid association guidelines, cooper 2009; esmo guidelines, pacini et al., 2012; nccn guidelines, tuttle, et al., 2010). to date, one tki, sorafenib, has been approved in the european union (eu) and united states (us) for the treatment of rr-dtc. this approval was based on the results of one phase 3 study (the decision trial) of sorafenib in 417 subjects with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic rr-dtc (epar nexavar). in this study, median pfs time was 10.8 months in the sorafenib group compared to 5.8 months in the placebo group (hr=0.587; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.454, 0.758; one-sided p &lt;0.0001) (see smpc nexavar).

about the product
</header>
<p>
lenvima comprises the antineoplastic agent lenvatinib mesilate. lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) receptors vegfr1 (flt1), vegfr2 (kdr), and vegfr3 (flt4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related rtks including fibroblast growth factor (fgf) receptors fgfr1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor (pdgf) receptor pdgfrα, kit, and ret (see smpc section 5.1). the antitumor effects of lenvatinib in patients with thyroid cancer are based primarily on its activity against proangiogenic vegfr2. other potential mechanisms involve the inhibition of oncogenic fgfr1, fgfr2, and ret kinase (see non-clinical section). indication and dosage lenvima is formulated in 2 strengths of hypromellose hard capsules containing lenvatinib mesilate equivalent to either 4 mg or 10 mg of lenvatinib. the applied indication was for the treatment of patients with progressive, radioiodine-refractory (rr) differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc). the recommended indication is lenvima is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated (papillary/follicular/hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (dtc), refractory to radioactive iodine (rai) (see smpc section 4.1) lenvima treatment should be initiated and supervised by a health care professional experienced in the use of anticancer therapies (see smpc section 4.2). the recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg taken once daily.
</p>
<p>
the daily dose is to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan (see dose adjustment in smpc section 4.2).
</p>
<p>
ema/250082/2015
</p>
<p>
page 12/169
</p>
<p>
if a patient misses a dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration.
</p>
<p>
treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs (see smpc section 4.2).

manufacture, characterisation and process controls
</header>
<p>
the manufacturing process of lenvatinib mesilate consists of two synthetic steps followed by salt formation. five crystallisations ensure the control of the impurity profile of lenvatinib mesilate. well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used.
</p>
<p>
a quality by design (qbd) approach was used in the process development of lenvatinib mesilate. a quality target product profile (qtpp) was defined for the finished product and the properties of the active substance shown to impact on this were defined as critical quality attributes (cqas). active substance cqas are impurities, residual solvents, residual genotoxins, particle size, and polymorphic form. critical process parameters (cpps) in the synthetic process were identified by risk assessment (including failure mode effects analysis, fmea), process knowledge, and both uni- and multi-variate experiments. each of the 3 steps contains cpps and thus all are considered critical. proven acceptable ranges (pars) for all the cpps have been defined. however, no design space is claimed by the applicant so for each step, only one cpp may be moved within its par with other cpps help at their target set-point. the quality of the active substance is assured by a control strategy composed of the above-mentioned pars and a series of in process controls designed to limit impurities and residual solvents. despite the qbd approach to development, the applicant employs traditional release testing to ensure the quality of the active substance. data from the first process validation batch of lenvatinib mesilate is provided. the cpps were all controlled within the pars and the lenvatinib mesilate thus produced was of adequate quality and in line with the active substance specification. the characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the eu guideline on chemistry of new active substances. potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. all potential impurities and the starting material (sm) itself have been evaluated according to chmp guidelines on genotoxic impurities. this analysis is based on experimental and computational sar analysis using derek and mcase software systems and ames-test. there have been no impurities detected above the reporting threshold (0.05%) in 10 batches. a hplc method was developed to detect the 16 potential impurities. specifications for only 2 from 16 potential impurities have been defined based on spiking studies. the spike study of genotoxic impurity demonstrates that during manufacturing process is able to purge to levels below the ttc of 60ppm, from 0.30% to 3ppm, in the intermediate. the genotoxic impurities show no detectable levels in 10 batches. adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. the specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

description of the product and pharmaceutical development
</header>
<p>
lenvatinib mesilate was found to be a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor which works as an anticancer drug, and it was decided to develop it as an immediate release solid oral dosage form. the aim was to develop and oral immediate release form which allows patents to administer the drug themselves, easy to handle, and obtain desired bioability.
</p>
<p>
the product is presented in multiple strengths easily distinguished by combination of shape, color, shape and prints to allow dose adjustments and minimizes risk of side effects and the mix-up of strengths and products.
</p>
<p>
the active substance stability, solubility, polymorphism and particle size characteristics were taken into account during the pharmaceutical development. lenvatinib mesilate, potentially includes a genotoxic impurity and degradant, which is also a synthetic intermediate of lenvatinib. it was found to increase in the active substance by decomposition by heat stress. in addition, lenvatinib mesilate forms a gel when it is in contact with dissolution media. therefore, the related substances and dissolution were designated as critical quality attributes for lenvatinib capsules.
</p>
<p>
film-coated tablets were first developed and used in the early clinical trials. however, it was found that the excipients and process used to manufacture this pharmaceutical form had a negative impact on related substances and increased the level of the genotoxic impurity in the finished product. because of these concerns, development of another formulation for commercial production was initiated. a capsule formulation was developed in order to address the manufacturability issues associated with the initial tablet manufacturing process. these were used for pivotal clinical studies and selected as the pharmaceutical form of the marketed product.
</p>
<p>
the excipients for lenvatinib capsules were selected to ensure both appropriate stability and dissolution of the finished product. therefore, compatibility of the active substances with excipients, their functions, and their relative concentrations were studied. non-hygroscopic excipients were chosen to limit the level of water and reduce the risk of degradation of lenvatinib mesilate. calcium carbonate was selected as a water insoluble inorganic diluent, which could effectively avoid gelation of the active substance without preventing dispersion of drug substance particles.

all excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and for the majority, their quality is compliant with ph eur standards. the only non-pharmacopeial excipients are low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and the hypromellose capsule shells. the specification for low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose complies with the national formulary (nf) and is considered to be acceptable. the components of the capsules comply with the ph eur with the exception of butyl alcohol for which no ph eur monograph exists. this component complies with the nf monograph. there are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. the list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the smpc. the formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that proposed for commercialization. a bioequivalence study was performed between capsules and tablets, which concluded that the same strength of capsules (10mg) could be used for pivotal clinical studies.
</p>
<p>
the manufacturing process is a standard process consisting of mixing, granulation, drying, milling, blending and encapsulation steps. an initial risk assessment for the manufacturing process at commercial production scale was performed so as to identify process parameters that were likely to have an impact on the cqas of lenvatinib capsules.. development and formal validation data are convincing that the physical state of the active substance is under control throughout manufacturing of the capsules. nevertheless, the chmp recommended testing the first 10 commercial batches intended for marketing in order to determine the physical state of lenvatinib mesilate in the finished product. the chmp also recommended testing of the physical form (type c crystal level) of lenvatinib mesilate in formal stability studies up to the end (60 months) and in at least on the first 2 commercial batches of each strength to be included in the post approval stability studies. lenvatinib capsules are packaged in polyamide and polyvinyl chloride (pvc) laminated aluminium film with push-through aluminium foil blisters (alu/alu blisters). specifications for the forming film and lidding foil have been provided. the specifications contain an ir identification test. the forming lid is stated to comply with ph. eur. 3.1.11, ec directive 2002/72ec and ec directive 78/142/eec. the lidding foil is stated to comply with ec directive 2002/72ec and ec directive 78/142/eec.

<p>
the manufacturing process of lenvima capsules consists in a conventional wet granulation of nine steps: mixing, granulation, drying, milling, blending, encapsulation, weight-sorting, bulk packaging, and blister packaging. the process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. primary stability batches have been manufactured. three batches of each strength (4 mg and 10 mg) were manufactured; two batches were manufactured at pilot scale and one batch was manufactured at full commercial scale.
</p>
<p>
formal validation of the process has been completed on 3 commercial batches ofeach strength. the full validation results have not been provided yet. the applicant made a declaration that the validation results are acceptable (process parameters within pars and expected values; ipcs compliant, final results within specs and additional tests within expected range).
</p>
<p>
as the manufacturing process is a standard process, this is considered acceptable. during formal validation, further investigation has been performed on the physical state of the active sunstance. the processes from drying through weight-sorting did not have any impact on the physical state of the active substance in the finished product.

primary pharmacodynamic studies
</header>
<p>
the primary pharmacodynamics effects of lenvatinib were evaluated in in vitro kinase inhibition (profiling) assays, kinetic interaction studies, x-ray analysis of the crystal structure of the vegfr2-lenvatinib complex, in vitro cell-based assays, and in vivo studies in various human tumour xenograft models in athymic mice.
</p>
<p>
in vivo studies in various human xenograft models included evaluation of the activity of lenvatinib as a single agent as well as in combination with other anticancer agents. in vitro studies kinase inhibition profiling studies 1 and 2 (studies w-201208 and w-20120814) two kinase inhibition profiling studies against a total of 66 purified recombinant protein kinases (including tyrosine kinases and serine threonine kinases) showed that lenvatinib is a potent multiple kinase inhibitor.
</p>
<p>
ic50 values were determined by measuring the cell-free kinase activities with lenvatinib

(0.3 - 10,000 nmol/l) by elisa or mobility shift assay. the profile for sorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor in clinical use, was also studied under the same condition as a reference. the most sensitive kinases for lenvatinib included vegf receptors (vegfr1 – 3), and ret with ic50 values below 10 nmol/l, specifically 4.7, 3.0, 2.3, and 6.4 nmol/l, respectively.
</p>
<p>
the second highly sensitive group included fgf receptors (fgfr1 - 4), pdgfrα, and kit with ic50 values between 10 and 100 nmol/l, specifically 61, 27, 52, 43, 29, and 85 nmol/l, respectively.
</p>
<p>
all are typical pro-angiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related rtks. against vegfr1 – 3 and fgfr1 – 3, ic50 values for lenvatinib were several-fold lower than those of sorafenib.
</p>
<p>
in particular, the ic50 of lenvatinib against fgfr4 was approximately 80-fold lower than that of sorafenib.
</p>
<p>
in contrast, the ic50 values for lenvatinib against pdgfrα, pdgfrβ and raf1 were higher than those of sorafenib. in these assays, lenvatinib was more selective to vegf receptors and fgf receptors and less selective to pdgf receptors and raf1 compared to sorafenib. in regard to inhibition of pdgfr tyrosine kinases, pdgfrα and pdgfrβ, the inhibitory activity of lenvatinib towards pdgfrβ was lower than that for pdgfrα.
</p>
<p>
a cell-free kinase inhibitory assay showed that ic50 values of lenvatinib for pdgfrα and pdgfrβ were 29 and 160 nmol/l, respectively.
</p>
<p>
these values were about 10-fold and 53-fold higher, respectively, than that for vegfr2 (3.0 nmol/l), indicating that the inhibition of pdgfrβ by lenvatinib is very weak. with regards to the fgfrs, as compared to the ic50 values for fgfr-1 (61 nmol/l or 31.9 ng/ml), fgfr-3 (52 nmol/l or 27.2 ng/ml) and fgfr-4 (43 nmol/l or 22.5 ng/ml) the ic50 value for fgfr2 was 27 nmol/l (14.1 ng/ml).
</p>
<p>
fgfr2 was more sensitive to inhibition by lenvatinib as compared to fgfr1, 3, 4. ic50 values for the inhibition of the 66 protein kinases tested with lenvatinib or sorafenib were grouped into the following ranges:
</p>
<p>
below 10 nmol/l, 10 – 100 nmol/l, 100 – 1000 nmol/l, 1000 – 10,000 nmol/l, and above 10,000 nmol/l.
</p>
<p>
for lenvatinib, ic50 values in these ranges were observed against 5, 8, 16, 10, and 27 kinases, respectively.
</p>
<p>
for sorafenib, ic50 values in the same ranges were observed against 3, 11, 14, 12, and 26 kinases, respectively, suggesting that the kinase selectivity of lenvatinib is comparable to that of sorafenib. kinase inhibition profiling study 3 (study no. w-20120815) this study determined the inhibition constants (ki) for selected kinases. the ki values were calculated using a dixon plot of the inhibition by lenvatinib (0.3 – 260 nmol/l) under 6 different concentrations of atp.
</p>
<p>
ki values of lenvatinib against vegfr1, 2, and 3, and ret were approximately 1 nmol/l (1.3, 0.74, 0.71, and 1.5 nmol/l, respectively).
</p>
<p>
lenvatinib also inhibited other rtks including fgfr1, 2, and 3, and kit with ki values of 22, 8.2, 15, and 11 nmol/l, respectively. the inhibition mode against these kinases was found to be competitive. kinetic interaction analysis against vegfr2 (study no. w-20140526) this study determined the dissociation rate constant (koff = 1/ residence time), association rate constant (kon), and equilibrium dissociation constant (kd = koff / kon) for vegfr2. these values for the binding of lenvatinib and sorafenib against human recombinant protein of vegfr2 including kinase domain (leu834-asn1162) were measured using a reporter displacement assay (neumann, et al., 2011).
</p>
<p>
the kd value for lenvatinib against vegfr2 was 2.1 nmol/l, which is about 16 fold lower than that of sorafenib.
</p>
<p>
this difference is due to the balance for koff and kon values of lenvatinib, which are about 3.8-fold and 60-fold higher than for sorafenib, respectively. these results suggested that lenvatinib dissociated sooner from the target, but associated much more rapidly to the active site of vegfr2, and the overall result was a superior binding affinity (based on a lower kd value) to the target compared to sorafenib.

</p>
<p>
crystal structure of vegfr2-lenvatinib complex (study no. w-20140522) x-ray analysis for the crystal structure of the vegfr2-lenvatinib complex showed that lenvatinib binds to both the adenosine triphosphate (atp)-binding site and the neighboring allosteric region in the kinase domain adopting an “aspartic acid-phenylalanine-glycine (dfg)-in” configuration, suggesting a different binding mode compared to sorafenib. the amino acid residues located in the vicinity of lenvatinib or sorafenib with a maximum distance of 3.9 å were identified as those belonging to an atp-binding site including a gate-keeper residue (common site for protein kinases), or the neighboring region, a non-conserved allosteric region (traxler and furet, 1999).
</p>
<p>
among the total of 25 amino acid residues, 16 residues were common for lenvatinib and sorafenib.
</p>
<p>
lenvatinib and sorafenib binded to the atp-binding site at their common core from the urea group to the quinoline ring (lenvatinib) and pyridine (sorafenib). they binded to the neighboring allosteric region via the cyclopropane ring (lenvatinib) or the 4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl ring (sorafenib).
</p>
<p>
this suggested a strong hydrophobic interaction between the cyclopropane ring of lenvatinib and the phenyl ring of phe1047.
</p>
<p>
both compounds could exert their kinase inhibitory activity through binding to the atp-binding site, while enhancing kinase selectivity through binding to the neighboring region (liao, 2007; zuccotto, et al., 2010; mctigue, et al., 2012). effects on vegf-driven vegfr2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and tube formation in the huvec model (studies m03008, m03006, m03005, w-20100606)
</p>
<p>
four studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of lenvatinib on vegf-driven cellular functions of huvecs, which could be considered as in vitro angiogenesis models, specifically vegfr2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and three-dimensional organization for tube formation.
</p>
<p>
lenvatinib inhibited vegf-driven vegfr2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and tube formation in the huvec model in concentration-dependent manners (ic50huvecphosphorylation=0.25 nm (0.11 ng/ml); ic50huvecproliferation= 3.4 nm (1.28 ng/ml); ic50huvectube formation= 2.1 nm (0.90 ng/ml). in the fourth study (study no. w-20100606) the effect of lenvatinib on huvec proliferation driven by both vegf (20 ng/ml) and hepatocyte growth factor (hgf, a met ligand [30 ng/ml]) was also studied.
</p>
<p>
lenvatinib (0.3 – 300 nmol/l) showed a concentration dependent, but partial inhibition (approximately 60% at 300 nmol/ml), as predicted by the kinase inhibitory profile in which lenvatinib strongly inhibited vegfr2 but not met.
</p>
<p>
effects of lenvatinib metabolites on vegf-driven proliferation of huvecs (study no. m06002) primary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib metabolites m1, m2, and m3 produced by liver microsomes were evaluated by measuring the inhibitory effects on vegf-driven proliferation of huvecs m1, m2, and m3 showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity, with ic50 values of 57 nmol/l (95% confidence interval [ci]:
